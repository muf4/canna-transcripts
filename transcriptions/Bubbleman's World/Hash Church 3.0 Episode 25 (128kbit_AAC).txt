[SPEAKER_11]: Record on this computer.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go live to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: This meeting is being live streamed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do we say?
[SPEAKER_11]: We say welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is episode 25 of Hash Church 3.0.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me just put that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to copy and paste the new link and
then go over to our old link and let it
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone know we are now live with Skunk
Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been 100 days, almost 100 days since
the last time we did a Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a bit of a long break.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that everyone's been busy doing all
sorts of different things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought it was a good time to
throw one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Been talking a lot with Addison Demora and
the 800 pounds mantra.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are throwing the legend of Hash
Dinner down in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought, well, let's do a little
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can talk about that a little bit,
maybe talk about some past legends of
[SPEAKER_11]: Hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And really most importantly, just to see
your smiling faces.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, your puppet Sam and Etienne's
smiling face.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're doing well, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing well, sir.
[SPEAKER_16]: Been working hard with my Veterans Action
Council.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, I've been seeing you all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we had a wonderful conversation with
Noam Chomsky last Friday.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched that, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Manufacturing Consent was one of my
favorite books back in the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: That shit is no joke.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, one of our members, Ricardo Prieta,
basically went to one of his classes there
[SPEAKER_16]: in Arizona at the college.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's one of our members.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he asked him and he said, yeah,
so we were very fortunate to have that
[SPEAKER_16]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_16]: And literally we spent some time crafting
the questions because we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_16]: come off, you know, not prepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: Noam Chomsky, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Noam Chomsky.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you read Manufacturing Consent?
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've been reading Noam since I was
a teenager.
[SPEAKER_16]: So to actually sit down and have a
conversation with him was humbling beyond
[SPEAKER_16]: all measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it also validated our work that we're
doing at the national and international
[SPEAKER_16]: level.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm working with Michael Prowitz.
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually spoke at the UN in April and
we're preparing to go to Vienna in the
[SPEAKER_16]: spring, as well as we're preparing for a
lobby day in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we Vets are really putting on the
pressure of really trying to put the U.S.
[SPEAKER_16]: VA system and the Canadian VA system
together because we want what you have in
[SPEAKER_16]: Canada, which is the access is the
availability to literally order on your
[SPEAKER_16]: cell phone right now and have your
medicine within three days.
[SPEAKER_16]: You get a rating per certain amount of
grams per day.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I won't go into it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I see we've got our other guest in here.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, yeah, needless to say, we're doing a
lot of good work for veterans
[SPEAKER_16]: internationally and they're welcome to
join us at Veterans Action Council.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get back to it and talk
more about it later because I just got to
[SPEAKER_11]: tell you, man, and obviously you've been
doing this for your whole life,
[SPEAKER_11]: everything that has led you to this.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm really proud of you, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me happy to see you out there
shining, helping people in the most
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what you do is not light for the
people that you do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is life or death shit for these guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not light, you know, side reading.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we're all proud of you,
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're inspirational.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to see you in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's Johnny B in the grow room
looking like a goddamn hippie.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, I just said that I was never
going to cut my hair, put the headphones
[SPEAKER_20]: in.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been working away this morning.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy Hash Sunday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Hash Sunday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's welcome Kevin and Addison from
800 Pounds Mantra.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are, well, you guys know Addison.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been on Hash for plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: His history, you guys have seen him from
screaming at DEA agents out in front of
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries into, you know, founding the
company Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, now has a bunch of really
cool stuff that they're going to tell us
[SPEAKER_11]: about today as well, as we kind of welcome
everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Addison.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Eddie.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to be seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to be seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to be seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to be seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to have a Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been watching all these Zoom things
happen like Etienne with Noam Chomsky on
[SPEAKER_11]: the Zoom meeting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was kind of like, damn, like,
got to step it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got this platform here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, any time you guys feel that you
want to do a Hash Church, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of spur of the moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I hit you guys up last minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do thank all of you for showing up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Dr. Mark with the fish shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy's just been crushing fucking fish
shows left, right and center.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I look at his Facebook,
it's either his daughter going off to
[SPEAKER_11]: college or him fucking tripping balls in a
fish show with all of his amazing friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good for you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, good for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, at live music, large live music
events again, kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, as it was strange in many
ways, but, you know, yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great to be back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great to be back here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to have you back here, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to have Best Friend Farms in the
house.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you got chopped over at Instagram
there recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to give your new Instagram
account up?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Back up on Best Friend Farms space 2.0,
the second version here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks for shouting that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I already saw you post.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you post?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like some crazy fucking like it was like
it was this dome of hash covered in like
[SPEAKER_11]: grease or something like I didn't even I
just caught it really quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your last post was like right back to that
one today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that one I just did this morning
before this was some flowers and that was
[SPEAKER_12]: that gas mask show key.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just kind of whipped it up and played
with it before the before the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude, Callie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Callie representing East Coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you are, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like the Callie dude that's just
like on the East Coast crushing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're happy to have you, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be talking a little bit
about Legends of Hash today on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got Addison and oh, did I freeze up?
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, now that Marcus is gone, I'm taking
over the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, that wasn't Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Starlink and every once in a while,
Starlink just glitches for about like
[SPEAKER_11]: five, five, ten seconds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Elon Musk for putting
satellites out into space and creating the
[SPEAKER_11]: Internet where, you know, I live in an
area that doesn't have good Internet.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when he first put up his first two
thousand satellites, he put it up into an
[SPEAKER_11]: area where a lot of Indigenous people
live, a lot of people that live that don't
[SPEAKER_11]: have access.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where he put up the first thousand
or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I guess he's eventually going to
get to 60,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: Eventually he'll eliminate cell phone
services because everything will be
[SPEAKER_11]: WhatsApp and Wi-Fi calling because you'll
have Wi-Fi literally everywhere you go in
[SPEAKER_11]: the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of scary, kind of awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured I'd get on the beta and support
someone who's thinking outside of the box
[SPEAKER_11]: because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate thinking outside of
the box.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my trip.
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of all of our trips.
[SPEAKER_16]: If we all stayed within the box,
we all wouldn't be here, correct?
[SPEAKER_16]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get the Starlink at the
office.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get the Starlink at the
office for 800 because we have terrible
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and we have no options.
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you don't need a box anymore
because the most part is seedless.
[SPEAKER_22]: You needed a box when you wanted to clean
your seeds out of your weed.
[SPEAKER_22]: But those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I followed for a long time to get out of
the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to be on this side for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take a dab, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just thinking we need to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already heated up, fellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm getting to my dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got an email in, so I'm already heated
up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the octaves and the regular
quartz nails, but the octaves where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Peli.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Peli Nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to D Nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got my D Nail Peli Nail combo going
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Mothership for the eggs.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a dabinator, which I can honestly
say has been plugged in and on for the
[SPEAKER_22]: last three years.
[SPEAKER_22]: I never turned it off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Maximillian from Dabinator
because honestly, I actually helped Sam
[SPEAKER_11]: get his Dabinator through Max because Max
is such a fucking awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I first got mine and I finally
killed mine, but it took me almost four
[SPEAKER_11]: years to left it on pretty much every
single day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when Sam says he's left his on every
single day, I can promise you,
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you this.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably rusted into place because
it's never been used.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've also took it to Jamaica with me and
it works fine with Jamaican electricity.
[SPEAKER_22]: And you could even use it with a
motorcycle battery.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how did you keep it on on the way to
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_22]: I plugged it to a cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't have it on.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was in my suitcase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aha.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're true that you're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I haven't been in Jamaica in three
years.
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, why aren't you putting that stuff in
your suitcase?
[SPEAKER_14]: You're supposed to carry it on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Checkmate.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_13]: As if I would ever get one over on Sam.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's completely cleaned up first.
[SPEAKER_22]: Spotless.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's going to tell us what they're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can't just, uh, let's show and tell
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies and cream hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Roses person.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me to move upstairs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some, uh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some grease monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: 91 20 press gets you so fucking lit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_21]: 73 90 press of the medicush.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's trips on this is 7.6.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, uh, fresh press that, uh,
looks like it's actually, this is whipped,
[SPEAKER_05]: but this is some glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I got some roles in diamonds.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got some gel dome with the calyx.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is some, uh, I've actually been
letting this cold cure after I did the
[SPEAKER_18]: diamond separation for about a week.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just going to send it off and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up Collins?
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice little jar.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I'm loving that sense set up in
the back there, but I'm digging Dr. Mark's
[SPEAKER_16]: pop set up over here on the head.
[SPEAKER_08]: That dog is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: His fucking, his skin is so thin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see his pinkness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that valley.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, dude, and what you've been
coming to hash church for seven years with
[SPEAKER_11]: those sins behind you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard you hit a key.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, uh, we can change that anytime you
want.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, these, I can turn them on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, maybe towards the end, maybe
towards the end, you and Dr. Mark can
[SPEAKER_11]: recreate the hash church song.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do space.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do our version of space.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: For, for many years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so, you know, today's hash church was
really sort of inspired by, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, well, it was really inspired by
Addison reaching out about a month ago,
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe more, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have three children.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he reached out and was like,
dude, like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what about legends?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, when are you going to, should we do
a legends in California?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, dude, I mean, obviously
there's the bear shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the woods.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, I did find out that indeed,
um, the bear does shit in the woods.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if you guys have seen this,
but, uh, yeah, it's been proven guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bear does shit in the woods right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's proof.
[SPEAKER_16]: I need a picture of the pope shitting in
the woods.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the other one I need.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the pope shit in the woods.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: The pope represents faith, but drives
around in a bullet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Proof vehicle enough said God willing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's he really?
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, we started.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't trust anyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we started talking about it,
you know, he, he's, you know, and for me,
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't avidly searching legends has
always been the most organic thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those of you that are living under
a rock, uh, and don't know what legends of
[SPEAKER_11]: hash is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe Sam, I would love to hear your
perspective as well, because I bet you we
[SPEAKER_11]: have slightly different memories or
perspectives of how it came to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: But from my sense, I kind of remember
sitting around with you at your place and
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob probably was there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Michael definitely wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think for the first conversation,
but we sort of started talking about,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, well, I think it started really
with Sam talking about how he'd been at
[SPEAKER_11]: every cannabis pop from day one and that
him and Rob always got gifted tickets from
[SPEAKER_11]: Hagar and they would show up at every one
and kind of walk around and kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: talking a little bit about some of the
stuff we didn't like about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was always, it was always a
cool thing to bash on high times for
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever reason, even though at the time
it was the only gig in town.
[SPEAKER_11]: And really it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the fact that they pulled off
what they pulled off, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was really also the birth of
legends because we sort of, I remember us
[SPEAKER_11]: talking like, Hey, like if we could just
get the best kind of 50 hash aficionados
[SPEAKER_11]: out of this group of, I don't know how
many went to the cup, like a thousand or
[SPEAKER_11]: 2000 people, maybe between a thousand and
1500 in those early days.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and for me, it became a metaphor of
like, yeah, let's run all these people
[SPEAKER_11]: through the bubble bags, filter out all
the two twenties and the one nineties and
[SPEAKER_11]: the one sixties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll just collect a party full of
nine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want 50, 90 micron people at this
party.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, is that how you remember the
first conversation going Sam or what's
[SPEAKER_11]: your memory of it?
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember that, uh, our focus was really
cannabis people and have to be necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: maker in the very, very beginning
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabis industry, you know, and you were
a heavyweight and appreciated smoking.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then you got an invite because it was
invitation only.
[SPEAKER_11]: It definitely wasn't the first year that I
was asking to see people.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the first year that I got to see
people's hashes that modified by the
[SPEAKER_11]: second or third year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It turned into this like, you know,
cause we had this incredible group of
[SPEAKER_11]: people in there the first year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really an amazing group of people,
truly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I, it's almost sad that we didn't
have just one person videography and have
[SPEAKER_11]: that tape locked in a vault somewhere
because to open that in 30 or 40 years
[SPEAKER_11]: would have really been something
incredible to leave behind.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the time for, you know,
of various reasons, uh, we, and we've
[SPEAKER_11]: always stuck with this, that cameras just
should not be allowed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, at legends in Barcelona the last year,
uh, I did allow one guy to come into
[SPEAKER_11]: videography and we controlled those audio
and videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was no, you know, everyone was
letting no one that's known at the door.
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of got to the point to where,
you know, cannabis is becoming more and
[SPEAKER_11]: more legal and there's less and less
illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in the first years, you know,
there were some people that moved large
[SPEAKER_11]: amounts of hash that ended up at the party
and in respect to them, because not that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, me and Sam were smoking on that
hash or whatever, but it was important
[SPEAKER_11]: that that hash went to where it needed to
go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was important that those people
that would smoke that hash, like I was
[SPEAKER_11]: talking to Addison earlier on the
different, you know, compounds that we
[SPEAKER_11]: consume.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you read Michael Pollan's newest
book, uh, this is your mind on plants or
[SPEAKER_11]: this is your brain on plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great book.
[SPEAKER_11]: Caffeine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he goes all into the, I liked when he
talked about how conversations were
[SPEAKER_11]: created that shaped the world after work,
beers at the bar turned into tea houses
[SPEAKER_11]: and caffeine, coffee, coffee houses,
new people, intellectuals started having
[SPEAKER_11]: different conversations in those
environments.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those conversations started to shape
the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, you know, what legends could
potentially really become, and maybe it
[SPEAKER_11]: even was a little bit back in the day is
how we have an event where real charsity
[SPEAKER_11]: people, hashish people get together and
now in rooms where we're allowed to get
[SPEAKER_11]: together, it's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can have conversations that now
shape the future world that we're going to
[SPEAKER_11]: leave to our children.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that shit excites me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why, when you hit me up
Addison, and have this not just been super
[SPEAKER_11]: easy to Addison, like, has this been
difficult?
[SPEAKER_11]: Has there been like lots of obstacles or
is that, to me, it's just felt really
[SPEAKER_11]: flowing and smooth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everything you guys keep
bringing to the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you and Kevin mention a little
bit about your perspective on this and the
[SPEAKER_11]: plan for Legends of Tash, California one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think first thing to speak to what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that I think nowadays is
that we all have phones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those phones are cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bringing the whole tradition of not
having phones or cameras is something that
[SPEAKER_05]: I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're allowed to do what we do,
but technically, to throw this event in
[SPEAKER_05]: California, we're not allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's still kind of at that not allowed
phase in that place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we have to outwardly build
this thing as a dinner, which I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: though, adds to what makes this thing so
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it so unique compared to any
other event.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're never told.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, most of these guys, these makers,
you know, they're they're sort of been if
[SPEAKER_05]: it was legends, they were being invited
because they had the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we tried to incorporate here is when
we invite a maker, your plus one,
[SPEAKER_05]: we recommend that your plus one is either
the breeder or the farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way we're putting everybody in
the room together on this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also now Marcus and I were
talking earlier and it's like the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: makers are awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're forensic.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're guys that are doing forensic work
that are separating things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And able to, like, really get it down to
the point where it's pure, where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: completely isolated.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order for them to do their job,
they can't do it without great material.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just it's how many people are coming
to your event.
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have I'll break it down real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 25 makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those makers each get a plus one,
which will be either the farmer or the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's 20 guests that are industry,
you know, people that we think those 20
[SPEAKER_05]: makers would benefit from being in the
room with industry guys, guys that are
[SPEAKER_05]: hash that are hash guys, guys that are
literally legitimately have a reason to be
[SPEAKER_05]: in the room with them, whether it's,
you know, being in the room with Brian
[SPEAKER_05]: from Vital Garden Supply, which is one
that, you know, Brian has put more organic
[SPEAKER_05]: inputs into the cannabis supply production
for California than probably most people
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want them to be a room full of
guys like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those 20 will be those type of cats,
not necessarily influencers, but just
[SPEAKER_05]: people who have really lent to the
production of good material, good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of guys, too, that have never
[SPEAKER_07]: won before.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're hoping that there's going to be
more of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to just get that those those
makers to be guys that might have not been
[SPEAKER_05]: invited.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 20 are people that are pretty much,
you know, industry guys that really should
[SPEAKER_05]: be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have 15 spaces that are that
are staff and sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we're kind of fitting,
fitting that all together, putting it
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to be 85 people total Lebanese dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be, you know, I knew that
this thing was I knew that this thing was
[SPEAKER_05]: greenlit and by the culture and everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I reached out to Debbie and I invited
them as a guest and Debbie came back and
[SPEAKER_05]: was like, well, we want to do a mothership
drop during your event.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what's cool is he's he's producing
glass that specifically designed and sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of the aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a series called Botanicals,
which was a series that kind of did a nod
[SPEAKER_05]: back to to hash, which was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's going to incorporate chemistry
with botanicals and they're going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that drop at legends, which is kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So specifically for hash makers kind of he
was pretty stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's I knew that it was going to be
something different as soon as we got his
[SPEAKER_05]: blessing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as we started to see the
biggest guys that we reached out to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was calling everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to keep this thing in line with
legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I figured, you know, in my mind,
I'm like, what would Marcus do with
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would Marcus send you an email with all
the information in it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Marcus would just message you
and be like, I need to do a call with you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like an old drug deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to make sure that every one
of the contacts that go on for legends is
[SPEAKER_05]: just like an old drug deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a phone call.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a hey, bro, if I text you,
just call this number back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything's done in in line with the
old way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like a phone call, no cameras,
no phones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're making sure that, you know,
it's secretive in that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're making sure that anyone talks about
it talks about it as a dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's cloaked in that original sort of
secret, you know, how it was back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: day, which I think is helping the event a
bunch, because it's just kind of making
[SPEAKER_05]: people understand that it's an exclusive
event, that it's that it's invite only and
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's going to be a celebration of
hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we wanted to this year
incorporate Afghanistan as the cultural
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of focus for it with what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a good time to kind of to
let everybody know that the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to get a bunch of Afghan
refugees, a bunch of people from
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we get some guys that make
great hash that we can that can come and
[SPEAKER_05]: show us and teach us some other cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's going to be an event that
are not even an event.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really just honored to be able to
put it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not a day goes by that I don't
wake up and be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_05]: is this going to fall apart today?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, is this going to end it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every person that's wanted to be involved
has reached out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got big guys behind it that want to
help with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really hard for us to kind of
figure out how to pay for it, how to take
[SPEAKER_05]: care of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to bring in just any
sponsor, but it is a dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, you know, when we when we've gone
to other events and we've seen other
[SPEAKER_05]: things, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: We just looked at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the big conversations that Marcus
and I had was, you know, how do you take
[SPEAKER_05]: legends, which has been so secretive and
so protected, and bring it out to the
[SPEAKER_05]: public now and put it into a recreational
state?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's like, well,
there's certain components that have to
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them is going to be you know,
has to be marketed in some way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be we want to eventually open
this thing up to a larger community and be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to allow people to sort of enjoy
hashish at the same level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And appreciation for hashish at the same
level may never be at like the geeked out,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, nerdy level that we are at.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, to educate them on
hash and to get them open to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what the fuck is hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I talk to some people and they
think hash is like opium or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't even fucking know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still to this day are like,
oh, that's weed mixed with heroin,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what the fuck are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the broader public really doesn't
understand, you know, what hash is about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Marcus talked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the big picture, the big dream would
be to throw a massive hash event in
[SPEAKER_05]: California, recreationally legal,
and invite all kinds of people and educate
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within that event, on one of the
nights, we tuck legends into that night,
[SPEAKER_05]: because now we've got everyone there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can bring, you know, glass culture,
everything to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at some point now, you know,
I was thinking Marcus can finally monetize
[SPEAKER_05]: this thing and actually take it to other
places and build something so other people
[SPEAKER_05]: can start to enjoy it because weed's legal
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like, you know, in some
places we still have brothers that are,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, sitting behind bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have brothers that are,
you know, having to duck and run,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we all know the fun of the duck and
run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I honestly, in a lot of ways,
miss the duck and run days of hammering it
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, the bank of the earth and
all this cool shit that we lived a part
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nowadays, it's like, you know,
we can fucking legally do shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sort of, some of the taste has
been taken out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this, we want to keep this so that
taste is still there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, how the fuck do
you bring this thing to the big Republic?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of nerves in kind of doing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that you guys are connecting it to
the farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really all about like, let's get hash
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like where all these new people in Cali
and old folks that have been growing
[SPEAKER_11]: forever, that produce something really
special one year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where can we put that where it's on
display and it gets the attention that
[SPEAKER_11]: deserves to get by the people that it
needs to get from.
[SPEAKER_11]: So not only is it promoting hash makers
and the love of hash, but of course the
[SPEAKER_11]: root, which is, you know, that organic
regenerative biodynamic farmer who's
[SPEAKER_11]: producing and loving this residue.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's all just like a really,
we never did that at legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was always kind of individuals and
independence.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you could even go buy great hash if
you wanted to, you know, end up at a
[SPEAKER_11]: legend.
[SPEAKER_22]: What was nice about legends was because it
was an Amsterdam at the high times,
[SPEAKER_22]: we had such an international selection of
people.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, except that there was a lot of
Canadians there more than anybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_22]: Mostly Californians and then Canadians.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, I remember literally counting
people from over 20 countries at a
[SPEAKER_11]: legend's dinner.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's people representing from so
many countries right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, one thing I will say about
legends as well as I never left the
[SPEAKER_11]: legends and got the cannabis cough.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was always at other places.
[SPEAKER_22]: So no, but there were several times when
the restaurant artist, the Lebanese
[SPEAKER_22]: restaurant where we used to hold the event
was so filled with smoke that I had to go
[SPEAKER_22]: outside and breathe some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wubbly is that, that thing is unlike
anything I've ever hit in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that I waited every time I
went, I would wait as long as I could to
[SPEAKER_05]: hit that thing because I knew that after I
hit it, it was just fucking space.
[SPEAKER_22]: It used to blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_22]: Where was that girl from Denmark or
something that used to, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_22]: but you used to hit on it like crazy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, she even lit a few for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost forgot about her.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was from Denmark.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, it wasn't just that bubbly either.
[SPEAKER_11]: Addison, it was, it was, it was Sam's
hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that hash is not normal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it wasn't back then, even when I had
already been smoking full mouth and I felt
[SPEAKER_11]: like, Oh yeah, dude, I know what quality
is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to his house and the first time I
smoked a bowl of his hash and I'm not,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is not a lie.
[SPEAKER_11]: I literally got so high, so fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, Oh no, what if I shit myself
or vomit or I just went through all these
[SPEAKER_11]: crazy thoughts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he fed me like 20 more.
[SPEAKER_11]: No joke while he himself took 50 like over
the course of a couple of hours,
[SPEAKER_11]: I left that guy's house so fucked up in my
head.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just like, I remember Rob saying
like, Oh yeah, I was really stoned last
[SPEAKER_11]: night.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, you know, how stoned could you
be Rob?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on, what did you eat?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like an ounce of resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found myself in that position,
walking home from Sam's one late night in
[SPEAKER_11]: Amsterdam and just being absolutely
floored at how strong that man was.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course I'm like, Oh,
okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he went and lived in the hash producing
country, collected the seeds, grew
[SPEAKER_11]: hundreds of thousands to pick the
varieties, bred them with his savant like
[SPEAKER_11]: capabilities, then processed them with his
own fucking incredible processing methods.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a full meal deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a full house if it's the deck
of cards.
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember that the first couple of
events, it was mostly my hash we were
[SPEAKER_22]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then everybody started bringing better and
better and better, especially with water
[SPEAKER_22]: hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what really changed the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: First water hash came in and really lots
of people had really high quality water
[SPEAKER_22]: hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then it just kept growing and growing
and growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you could also tell based on Sam's
level of utter and complete snobbery,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was like at a level back then that was
like, you couldn't even fucking imagine
[SPEAKER_11]: that it was palpable.
[SPEAKER_11]: He would just not smoke anyone's hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: He would only smoke his own hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would smoke anybody's hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would smoke anybody's that was as good
or better than mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there wasn't any is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Back, back, back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You were just smoking your own.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, this motherfucker won't take
like a hit of my five star.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine, Marcus, if there was a
selection of hash from each of the legends
[SPEAKER_05]: that would have been put away and saved,
stored cryogenically for some day to come
[SPEAKER_05]: out and get some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would have been better than
any footage of anything, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can do it at California One,
the first annual California legend.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that very thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what happens when you get together
with your friends, smoke and have
conversations.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_22]: What you need to do is put a kilo away of
each of the winners.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin, I think we just.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to need a kilo and 40 grams to
make this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kilo and a 40 gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, thinking of that, like that,
like a hash vault like that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the legends event really could.
[SPEAKER_22]: I guarantee if you keep it from oxygen and
you freeze it and you keep it out of the
[SPEAKER_22]: light.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it does not change in a decade or
two, really.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or if it changes so little, you can barely
notice it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's a well built root cellar
would store it very well too.
[SPEAKER_22]: A freezer is 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because terpenes dissipate.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, you've got to freeze terpenes or
you lose them.
[SPEAKER_22]: 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: What batch is that from?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can't even believe how good it
smells.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been at room temperature for 13
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's still terpene rich?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm telling you, listen,
I remember when I smoked the whatever that
[SPEAKER_11]: 91 year batch was from the, you know,
that that Michael had that was like 10
[SPEAKER_11]: years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then 13 and 16.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the last time I hit it,
it was like 19 or 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it had no taste whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was pale.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the heads were red.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember the heads were all red.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude, I have pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But instead of powder, this is 13 years
old guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so red.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, isn't that fucking crazy?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm doing a shitty job on getting
the camera to focus on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I tried that, what, three years ago and it
was far.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, didn't it taste like perfume,
John?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, it tastes like the old
PK.
[SPEAKER_11]: How could these terpenes still be present
after that long?
[SPEAKER_14]: Marcus, it would be really interesting to
see what was the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_14]: epinoids, which are less volatile.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's probably no mercy left,
but I bet you, you got hash machine and
[SPEAKER_14]: probably other degraded terpenes.
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be really interesting to see the
entire terpene profile and percentages
[SPEAKER_22]: originally and today.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's aged.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from dragonfly earth medicines
farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a Mendo breath bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it, when you light it and exhale it,
it literally tastes and smells like a
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful, like natural perfume in the
air, almost Jasmine like, but not Jasmine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is also like, uh, they must've
given this to me like, a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're going to talk about hash,
we might as well see some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Colin, how do you, uh, how do you
store those, those 12 grams every time?
[SPEAKER_18]: So I break them up and I induction seal
the jars.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I put those into, into,
you know, uh, a minus 40 freezer and keep
[SPEAKER_18]: them there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I take them out one at a time as I
need.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, that's how I store them.
So that's how I store them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your, uh, how's your collection
looking?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got a lot here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I've got some California orange bud
here that I'm trying right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got some C 99 here to the right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, some, uh, some GMO.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, God, there's watermelon Zom Zom right.
[SPEAKER_18]: As well.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's like over a hundred different
varietals that I have that I have kept.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the California orange you have,
is it citrusy?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it is Sam.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the, it's the Eric 77 cut actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a rare one.
[SPEAKER_18]: 77 cut or if that's, if the kids are even
calling it that these days.
[SPEAKER_22]: Many people have told me that I made a
hybrid with skunk number one and
[SPEAKER_22]: California orange, two of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_22]: Indica sativa hybrids back in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_22]: And, uh, that's what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_22]: Tangy was selected from.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's the same cut, Sam,
actually, I think it's the California
[SPEAKER_18]: orange that that's, uh, that's the
surviving cut might be that one,
[SPEAKER_18]: Sam, from what I understand it,
that's it's believed to be that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause not all California orange was,
uh, citrusy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, some of them were barely citrusy and
some of them were really pronounced
[SPEAKER_22]: citrusy.
[SPEAKER_22]: And those are the ones I like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was, yeah, that's the one
Shanti Baba had Shanti Baba had the super
[SPEAKER_11]: citrusy one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he had like a multi acre greenhouse in
Bellinzona in the South of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember walking into it and they
were all about six to seven feet tall,
[SPEAKER_11]: Christmas trees, citrus had my eyes
watering because I was literally crying.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of the most beautiful things
I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked them right away.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, how, who grew these plants?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then he told me it was their first year
growing them and they were the local Swiss
[SPEAKER_11]: rose gardeners that he just took and said,
okay, listen, this is just like roses,
[SPEAKER_11]: except, uh, instead of thorns,
it's a resin that you can get in your
[SPEAKER_11]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't rub your eyes while you're
working on the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these fucking rose gardeners just
crushed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I could not believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Shanti Baba and his rose
gardener crew in Bellinzona 2001.
[SPEAKER_11]: And welcome Josh and Josh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragonfly regenerative guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to welcome these guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been here for a while and we're
just talking over them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terrible people who grow the resin that we
love.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to hear about the legends of hash and
everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who doesn't like hash,
you know, and rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Frenchy was here, he would tell us
rosin is not hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to bring that into the,
into the, uh, onto the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We included in the legends for this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosin is not hash, but hash rosin is hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, we included rosin into res,
into, uh, the legends for, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: California one.
[SPEAKER_22]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: I, I, I would let rosin into any contest
because technically it's not old school
[SPEAKER_22]: hash for sure, but it can be just as clean
as potent and as beautiful and terpene
[SPEAKER_22]: rich as any of the dry sift I ever made in
my life.
[SPEAKER_22]: We let it in because of how it makes us
feel.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you requiring that it's only hash
rosin or are you letting, letting flower
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no, they get to, they can select
either melt or rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's their choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to do flower rosin,
they're more than welcome to, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't really see a bunch of guys that
are doing flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mainly, it's all gone to,
um, hash rosin, uh, at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's,
we wanted to incorporate the grower on
[SPEAKER_05]: this one for the main reason that when I
got into cannabis, I was a grower at first
[SPEAKER_05]: and I grew some plants and I didn't become
a hash maker until I became a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was that lifestyle of hiding in
there and, you know, trimming my own shit
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'd get the finger hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I, and I Mark, I was Mark's rep
for bubble bags in, uh, Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: California when I was a sales rep in the
snowboard industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how Mark and I met.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was running around meeting people at
snowboard shops and at night I'd come home
[SPEAKER_05]: from being a rep and I'd work my grow room
and I, you know, on Saturday I'd make hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and fucking, you know, so we wanted to
make sure that the grower was there
[SPEAKER_05]: because we feel like there wouldn't be a
hash maker without the grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of us, the way we got into it was
through that door was through like that
[SPEAKER_05]: lonely lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, also too for resin, there's
actually dry shit rosin, there's water
[SPEAKER_22]: hash rosin, there's fresh frozen rosin,
there's from plant.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I mean, it just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_22]: But, uh, to me it's all good.
[SPEAKER_22]: If at the end you like it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, somebody can blast.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what, this isn't an Instagram
post.
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't for clout.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just for how it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_11]: And wouldn't it be amazing at some crazy
legend dinner.
[SPEAKER_11]: If someone came in with hash rods or
flower rods and, and smashed everyone off.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're open to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm open.
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta chuckle.
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta be open to anything or I even
think I think you have makers out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think if someone enters with,
with real sift, like actual sift quality
[SPEAKER_05]: made sift instead of melt, instead of some
of these other things, I think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: something a lot of people don't see is
actual sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, fucking, you can look at
sift long enough and it turns to fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how sensitive that shit is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you're talking the purest of the
pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I talk to a lot of people,
they don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, oh yeah, sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's not sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's sift is so different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like someone could slap you in
the face with sift and you would just be
[SPEAKER_05]: happy no matter what, because there's
something about sift compared to any of
[SPEAKER_05]: those other moves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, like, you know, Dave was saying
it's, it's just, I'm really, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did this in a way because where I
would, I would be blown away if I saw real
[SPEAKER_05]: sift and someone brings that to the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd be blown away if someone does
actually turn heads with flour rosin,
[SPEAKER_05]: not that it can't be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I think the cultivar has to be
specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: The grower has to be specific in order to
make it happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, Can I ask this question?
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be a little, a little off,
but this is a good panel of folks to ask.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I'm not as experienced in hash as
all you folks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a grower, but do you see difference
in, in hash made with made sensemia versus
[SPEAKER_15]: semia with seeds?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, cause I'm, I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a lot of pollen flying around.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, it's not as good.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not as good.
[SPEAKER_22]: It could still be great, but the terpene
levels are down by about 25% or more.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the cannabinoids could be slightly
down and there's less yield for the plant,
[SPEAKER_22]: of course.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had, we had, I had done a bunch.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I've been doing a lot of this
because I have a lot of pollen flying.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of like only thing I can do
is to, to make process it that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it ends up coming out really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's not like the fucking stuff
that you're going to remember for the rest
[SPEAKER_15]: of your life, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_15]: A minus quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I put it on the market and people are
really happy about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've actually had some people come up
to me and be curious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, you know, there's something extra
that's getting me high in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why I asked because I smoke so
much.
[SPEAKER_22]: You understand that all of the important
sifted hash in the world is from seeded
[SPEAKER_22]: plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those, those entries are not generally
winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and it's the, my whole brain has
really gotten onto this in the last like
[SPEAKER_15]: two months.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been thinking a lot about hash
because I am breeding.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I have someone process my
material, I lose 50%, 40% of my work.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I've been, I finally got myself a
freeze dryer and I was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: It dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, what you guys were talking about,
I could store this stuff freeze dried and
[SPEAKER_15]: sell it and hold it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I could do a big run of this one
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really cool right now and save the
whole thing or have whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and 10 years later, open that up and
be like, yo, I got some GMO anybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I love doing it, you know, on,
on a bigger level where you're bringing in
[SPEAKER_15]: super high end producers and washers and
being able to hold it that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's the way where it's gone to like,
just looking at it from, we get the,
[SPEAKER_05]: we get the privilege to visit all these
facilities and we're going into them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my favorite part is when you walk
through their setup and my second favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: or probably my favorite part is when they
bring you to the freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they open that freezer and you're
looking at 400, $500,000 worth of fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: melt, like jars massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone has this, this is,
you know, and, and we joke about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, Oh, that's actually where
their money is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in that freezer that they've got
stored there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other, the other nutty part is
when you walk through their processing
[SPEAKER_05]: areas and I can sit there and it's
Marcus's, you know, those, those Kenoko's
[SPEAKER_05]: those, these machines, these fucking free
these drives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all this new equipment that you
see wasn't here before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like, finally nicotique and
have dry hash, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, it'll be dry
[SPEAKER_07]: available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that it's not cheap to
produce this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like some of the big stuff that Whistler
tech is insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're trying to get Mark to get
us a large machine just to have at the
[SPEAKER_05]: event or something, you know, so people
can be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this thing is gone so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see behind you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the dehydrators, it's just,
there's so much that's now here in present
[SPEAKER_05]: for guys to be able to, you know,
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's, I like California.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have six plants, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take those six plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, you can flower that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're six plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could take that flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could sell all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always joke that like, you could move a,
you can move a box and fucking open a
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless lab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's where, that's where my brain
was going because I'm paying all these
[SPEAKER_15]: people to process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm paying all these people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, wait a sec.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I got, you know, a couple of big 30 by
96.
[SPEAKER_15]: I run the whole thing by myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, I could hire a crew to come
in for five days, bring it down.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I got a big machine like Marcus's
or the Whistler tech, I could watch the
[SPEAKER_15]: whole goddamn thing in three or four days
by myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm done, you know, and I've
wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saved some for long-term storage and I
can sell a little bit and move on.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, then you could lease rent out your
machine too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been wanting to call you on it,
you know, but it would change my game
[SPEAKER_15]: entirely as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause then I can just focus on my plants,
you know, and I can, then I can sit
[SPEAKER_15]: through everything and melt really easy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It took me a long time to get here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel kind of stupid because I was
actually, you know, but I just kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: took a break on it for years because of
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can breathe specifically for hash
dumping.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's not so easy, but yes,
it can be done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to spend the time and really
focus on all the data points and,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, just where the loss is and isn't
through the process, but it's,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, I, I find it really rewarding
and I recommend everyone to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that I've found.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was a grower first, and then I wanted to
make hash like most of you on here.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's, you know, look, you,
you hone in on what's important.
[SPEAKER_18]: And to me, it was, it was terping profile
and yield.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just knew that if I didn't do that,
I'd just be looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: less than 2% yields all the time and can,
you know, always wonder why.
Right.
[SPEAKER_22]: So dry sift, if you really want just pure
heads, you only get about 3% from a kilo
[SPEAKER_22]: of wheat.
[SPEAKER_22]: With water, you can get, you know,
10, maybe even 12 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_22]: With rosin, you, you got a similar number.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, economically, if you just grow
in a few plants and you want to make your
[SPEAKER_22]: own rosin or water hash makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: The highest I've ever gotten with rosin
and water hash is close to 30%.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are rare, but they, they did happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not many people get 20%.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not many people are going to hit those
numbers.
[SPEAKER_11]: No milk or to 5% fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Sam, when he was talking,
um, uh, three, uh, those low percentages,
[SPEAKER_11]: four or 5%, he's talking fresh frozen,
which four or 5% is like 16 to 20% dry
[SPEAKER_11]: yield.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: When Sam's saying 3%, he's talking dry
yield.
[SPEAKER_22]: I start with dried plants.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I get rid of all the crap and all the
crap and all the crap.
[SPEAKER_22]: So finally all that's left is little resin
heads and I never have more than two or
[SPEAKER_22]: 3%.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good company.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good company.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard to, to, to accomplish all the
time.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, if you're hitting 8%,
that's a really amazing place to be,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, hone in on, on whatever
varietals and parent stock that's doing
[SPEAKER_15]: the GMO root beer, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you guys, this shit is fucking
fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have test numbers on all the
varieties here in a few days, but it's
[SPEAKER_15]: happened that for sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like GMO players.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're weird.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you get it?
[SPEAKER_05]: GMO plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, since we're, since we're talking
numbers and yields, Kevin and I have been
[SPEAKER_05]: working at, at, uh, 800 for the last
probably like 18 months selling fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: frozen in the market, pretty much being a
broker to the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what we saw was
disappointment, sadness, anger,
[SPEAKER_05]: deceit, uh, you know, bad stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you saw was farmers that had these
ingenuitive cats that would come in
[SPEAKER_05]: logistics guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would come in with reefer trucks and
they had the grand old idea of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're going to come in here and we can
use your staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to harvest and freeze all
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we freeze it, you can get your
harvest, you can get your next row going
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're going to sell it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they kind of duped a lot of the farmers
into thinking that this was the way to do
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens then is the stuff's not
selling the reefer trucks sitting there on
[SPEAKER_05]: the farmer's land at 1600 bucks a month,
all the profit starts to get eaten away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The farmers literally has a bunch of
material that the reefer truck leaves and
[SPEAKER_05]: they have to either drop the price to the
point where they didn't make anything and
[SPEAKER_05]: lost a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we saw this everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just like, and the other thing we
saw as hash consumers was that it was the
[SPEAKER_05]: same fucking 16 to 22 strains over and
over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these assholes started to fuck us
again because they started taking the same
[SPEAKER_05]: 16 to 22 strains and mixing the melt and
pressing that and calling it a modified.
[SPEAKER_05]: And making a new skew, which is good for
business, but shitty for my fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Hey, Addison, ask a question.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you say about hashing is certainly
true.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think with cultivars, but not
necessarily extends over to solvent based
[SPEAKER_14]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, as you know, there's an incredible
market for fresh frozen in for solvent
[SPEAKER_14]: based extracts, especially in reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just the way that it doesn't
really, it's most productions not based on
[SPEAKER_14]: vertical integration where you have
control of the grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly if you're making,
if you're making live resin and you're
[SPEAKER_14]: doing fresh frozen extraction,
just like with ash, you can't,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can't make a good extract out of bad
starting material, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: You can certainly, certainly turn good
starting material into a bad extract,
[SPEAKER_14]: but not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that the, the pressure on those
growers now is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: they can easily dump that stuff probably
at a much lower cost, higher volumes to
[SPEAKER_14]: the guys who are just buying it and
extracting it as much as they possibly can
[SPEAKER_14]: to make sauce and diamonds on the solvent
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, and they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what we're talking about within
that 18 month period, we saw that there
[SPEAKER_05]: was some, you know, we'll call them bottom
feeders, like guys that didn't give a shit
[SPEAKER_05]: and they would buy it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even the BHO guys were only getting
1.8%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about shit material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it was, was now this system was
concentrating shit material that was then
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to be sold in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we looked at that and we're like,
this is kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're lucky enough that a lot of our
friends are big breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would go and be with our buddies and
we'd be smoking hash and they would have
[SPEAKER_05]: this fucking strain or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd be like, Oh, this is my blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd be like, well, how come this
isn't in the hash market?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this happened multiple times that,
Oh, well, you know, I put it out in seven,
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 grabbed it and they do it in like
limited runs, but that's like the only
[SPEAKER_05]: big, you know, guy that grabbed it and
it's out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were just like, what the fuck is
wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we realized, Oh, you're a
breeder, not a marketer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a breeder, not a this, you're a
breeder, not a that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so your focus is to breed,
to just be in there making genetics and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and love your life in that place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we were like, okay, it's our job to
now figure out how to fix this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went to those breeders and said,
listen, I've got a network of a hundred,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, of 36, 40 something farms that
are going to be able to produce this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, these specific cultivars that
you have that are hash specific,
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get those into production.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we get them into the washrooms and we
can help popularize the strains,
[SPEAKER_05]: would you be willing to just take these
genetics, whatever you have that you think
[SPEAKER_05]: are right and give them to us?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll make sure that your name is,
you know, recognized the whole time and
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's integrity in what we do with
the, with the farms that we work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got breeders to agree to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We then went and we know, we knew that we
needed an actual nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went and found a nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have about, right now we have seven or
eight breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got about 40, 45 or 46 strains that
are all brand new for solventless hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: according to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all producing at least at 4%
for solventless production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of the challenge that it
has to produce at least 15% THC dried
[SPEAKER_05]: weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has to be at least a 4% to get into
pipeline as a brand new strain that's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to come in from a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what we did was we also realized that
we had to figure out how to take the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: material from the farm within the farmer's
model and what he's doing at harvesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the farmer knows when it's ready,
pulls it, starts to dry it and cures it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did was built a system that fits
into their model and allows us to take a
[SPEAKER_05]: test wash at the right time, specifically
at the right time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a network of buyers that we're
already shopping the list of strains to
[SPEAKER_05]: and the harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we do that, the guys that are buying,
they can look at that list based on
[SPEAKER_05]: strains or cultivars and say, oh,
these are coming down on these dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me set up my test washes on that date.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been doing this over the last
two months and orchestrating this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we have a lab that test washes with
us, if they like the product, they get
[SPEAKER_05]: first right to refuse it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're moving through 2,000,
3,000 pounds of material at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The farmer's stoked because we're like,
hey, pull the leaves 12 hours before,
[SPEAKER_05]: then come in, apply this harvest bucking
method, make sure that they're frozen and
[SPEAKER_05]: stored this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this whole entire thing is all done
specifically for the process because now
[SPEAKER_05]: if we do it that way, we can advertise to
the makers, hey, we followed all these
[SPEAKER_05]: protocols and SOPs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using these strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this thing is knocking off now,
doing so well that we already have guys
[SPEAKER_05]: that we went to and pitched it to that
were so stoned that they came back and
[SPEAKER_05]: pitched it to us, which I think is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had to remind them that,
look, we built this in a way where you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't really do this without the
relationship with the breeders,
[SPEAKER_05]: without the relationship with a really
great nursery that you can trust.
[SPEAKER_05]: And without the relationship then with
existing makers that you're already
[SPEAKER_05]: selling material to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these guys that are trying to
copy us are the logistics guys that came
[SPEAKER_05]: in and fucked everybody the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we approach it with loving kindness.
[SPEAKER_05]: We approach it with logic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just look at it and say very
selfishly, how the fuck do we make it so
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's better strains for us to
smoke ash?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really the selfish approach to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we figured it was clear from
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're talking about clones, yes,
not seeds.
[SPEAKER_22]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_22]: Seeds, from seed.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there's got to be variation.
[SPEAKER_22]: There is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why the nursery partner that we
have, we selected a very specific nursery
[SPEAKER_05]: partner that's very good at propagation
and very good at communication.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can have them work directly with the
breeder that bred it and help them
[SPEAKER_05]: understand what characteristics they're
looking for through the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a lot of looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did find a partner that's willing
to take the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we also have a very rich scene in
California with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have access to the genetics in clone
form that we can tissue culture and bring
[SPEAKER_05]: those lablets in and be able to also then
use the specific strain that the breeder's
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, the actual one that they
selected.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also fun for the breeders of the
nursery to be able to get in there and
[SPEAKER_05]: open it up and see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they may see one that's a great
flower version.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may see one that's a great hash
version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we want to start defining
things differently that way.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in favor of clonal production.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm a seed guy.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's an honest person.
[SPEAKER_22]: But what I do is I grow thousands of seeds
to select out the one or two that I want
[SPEAKER_22]: to clone.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't use clones.
[SPEAKER_22]: Clones are the way, not seedlings.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because seedlings are just too variable.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's good and bad for the reason
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_22]: But when you're producing a product,
you don't really want variability.
[SPEAKER_22]: You want it to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we have the guys that we're
working with at the nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very good at doing selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do selection with compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do selection with some really big
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've got an eye for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they tend to be able to lean a little
more toward hash as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we figure some of it will come through
in clone form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some of it's rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have it in seed form yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they haven't produced it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we look at it as if we're able to give
these great guys at the nursery,
[SPEAKER_05]: these great growers, the ability to pop
the beans and find what's in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's a good start.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's going to give us a strain or
a cultivar that we can narrow down on and
[SPEAKER_05]: run test washed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hey, if the test wash come back and
it's at 5%, 6%, 7%, we've got a winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's crazy about what's going on now
that we're seeing, we just watched Taylor
[SPEAKER_05]: T.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bezel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched him start a brand new seed
company that he's been working on for the
[SPEAKER_05]: last two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And out of the seeds that he bred,
he started to put out test batches that
[SPEAKER_05]: went out that are now coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guys have had time to mess with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one of them called twins,
which is fully purple, coming out at 5%
[SPEAKER_07]: yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: What he's doing is he's making crosses
with his shallot shishimi and his fofana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of those are base as what he's
using for progenitors for hash breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shallot shishimi is a GMO cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fofana is a banana cross, which are
both well-known for dumping heavy snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what he did was he's created cross-bred
and created some versions of those that he
[SPEAKER_05]: then bred in and did what you're saying,
did a thousand crosses.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not so easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been breeding for resin longer than
anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_22]: But for example, two of the easiest ones
to drop resin after you've dried the
[SPEAKER_22]: plants is sleeve stack from DNA Boys.
[SPEAKER_22]: And skunk number one from me.
[SPEAKER_22]: I made a hybrid between the two.
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, I made a bunch of them and none
of them dropped resin as easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it takes so long for those guys to be
able to put stuff out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're trying to do is accelerate that
process by getting a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this nursery that we're talking
about, this group that we're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about, they're $150 million company,
but they're owned by a men doe grower,
[SPEAKER_05]: a single guy that's a men doe grower that
you can hang out with and talk with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's also a generational strawberry
and tomato farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this guy's able to do,
what I've seen in terms of quality control
[SPEAKER_05]: on a large scale, understanding what steep
hill and quality control and testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: what this guy's able to do, I've never
seen anyone do.
[SPEAKER_22]: Was he a strawberry grower or a strawberry
breeder?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a strawberry grower with
generational family members that were
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders of both tomatoes and
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, because strawberries are so similar
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_22]: With strawberries, you started 20,000
seeds or more, maybe 10 best for whatever
[SPEAKER_22]: criteria that you're interested in
selecting for.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you use that, both selections
maybe to breed one step further.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then what you do is you make runners,
you basically clone it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's what you deliver to the
strawberry farmers, the runners,
[SPEAKER_22]: the clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's, this guy's very impressive,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were pretty selective on who we would
even work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were looking with and talking with
a number of big nurseries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we like about him is that he owns
the whole thing himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has one partner who's a big tech guy
that handles a lot of the tech end of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Tristan handles all of the grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've met his entire staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love the vibe of everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we trust them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea again is to get them,
to put them in a position where they're in
[SPEAKER_05]: a well enough relationship with the
breeders and pipeline that we're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: get that information to them and do some
selection and get to see what that
[SPEAKER_05]: selection delivers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have a lot of clones that have
come from the breeders as well that have
[SPEAKER_05]: gone into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have lablets of those in original
format.
[SPEAKER_05]: That are proven for genetic stuff that
they've done.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these guys, they breed stuff and
they don't put it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It only stays to themselves or in their
small circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got them to give us the clones
now and we can start popularizing their
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics if they're hash dumpers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually doing really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in phase one now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've done in phase one is we've gone
to the farm and the nursery that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: We as hash guys have reviewed their lists
of genetics that they have and also
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize that they work with some really
big breeders in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very close with compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really close with a couple other
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that they're in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And phase one is to look at the genetics
that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're starting to do that harvest
scheduling based on the genetics that they
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found some, you know, we just found
some really amazing grease monkey.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just found some really great Sunday
driver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I mean by found is we are able to
get ahold of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're able to do a test wash on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That Sunday driver came back I think at
four and a half, 4.48%.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sunday driver, the grease monkey was a
grease monkey was 4.48.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Sunday driver was a 3.8%.
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are gravimetric isolated yields
of hash you're talking about, correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from fresh frozen to the dried
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what would those, if you tested those
plants and got a COA based on dried plant
[SPEAKER_14]: material, what would they analyze for in
terms of total cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the dry weight for most stuff here in
California, the highest you ever see is
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe up to 20, you know, in a concentrate
or in a flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I'm just trying to qualify like
the potency of that material versus what
[SPEAKER_14]: you would normally see on a COA for dried
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's going to be, you know,
the dried flower, like we said,
[SPEAKER_05]: is roughly most of the time in California,
you're about 15 to 22% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Realistically, a lot of guys here like to
take THCA, THC, and some other THC and add
[SPEAKER_05]: it up and say that their stuff is 30% THC,
which is total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, wait, you can have cannabis 30%
THC.
[SPEAKER_22]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_22]: Delta 9 THC?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially the acid form because it's a
little bit heavier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not talking about THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either and or.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked at more, I've looked at more
cannabis testing data than any other
[SPEAKER_05]: person in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked at more.
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, I have my doubts.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've scoured more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've had my own lab for the last 30 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many samples have you run?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousands and thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done, at Steep Hill in one year,
we've done over, I'd say 150,000 runs at
[SPEAKER_05]: one location.
[SPEAKER_22]: Who's doing the analysis for you,
150,000?
[SPEAKER_22]: The final analysis, Paul Daley.
[SPEAKER_22]: And what lab is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it comes to data, I've looked at
the data, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're telling me now that if I had a gram
of that dried flour in my hand,
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% of that gram of dried flour in my hand
is pure THC.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, actually, the highest that I've ever
run in myself was 29.6.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of Delta 9 THC?
[SPEAKER_22]: Dried material, and it was Delta 9 THC,
not THCA because I ran it on my DC.
[SPEAKER_14]: 30% THC would equate to 38.5% THCA.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I call a bullshit on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't have plant material.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're plucking the top of your
colas and you're testing nothing else,
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's no other stem material in
there because any non-tricone producing
[SPEAKER_14]: material is going to dilute that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in a typical biomass sample,
what you would do is you would,
[SPEAKER_14]: and Aitken knows this because I'm sure he
sees this all the time in his purchasing,
[SPEAKER_14]: is that there are sampling protocols for
basically sampling large sums of cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: for an accurate COA that then Aitken's
price on that material is based on.
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand all of this, Mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been doing this a really long time.
[SPEAKER_22]: But what we did was we used a sample that
was heavily manicured the way it would be
[SPEAKER_22]: as a consumer with smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it wasn't unmanicured.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was very manicured, but it was 29.6%
THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: That is rare, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have to say, we are not seeing
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I'm mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_22]: The highest I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of mine was in the range of 22,
25 was high.
[SPEAKER_16]: For you, I would say you would probably be
the only one.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for us on the ground in the market,
we do not see that here on the ground.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have never seen close to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have people come up and say that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've seen laboratories that aren't
reputable spike samples in that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We even saw in the category when I did the
emerald cup, how they were actually mixing
[SPEAKER_16]: in the live rosin, et cetera, just try to
spike the numbers so they hit certain THC
[SPEAKER_16]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is happening.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's manipulation in the scene.
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the same time, I just got to give a
shout out, Addison, proud of you,
[SPEAKER_16]: really proud of you, because you're one of
the OGs in the sense of what California,
[SPEAKER_16]: for those who don't know, Addison had one
of the earlier dispensaries, got busted,
[SPEAKER_16]: fought the system, started Steep Hill
Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just stayed in and stayed true
because I worked with him back in 07 and
[SPEAKER_16]: 08 actually on the original testing here
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_16]: So much love, great respect.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't see it as a pissing contest
between you guys here number wise.
[SPEAKER_16]: You've seen rare air, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we on the ground do not see anything
close to that rare.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're lucky to see the 20% besides the 22
to 25.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's more common to see.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the under 20, then you're going to see
anything over 20, unless I'm mistaken,
[SPEAKER_16]: Addison.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: When I tested all the samples that were
entered into the High Times Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_22]: here in the Netherlands, which I did each
year, yeah, they seldom were 20,
[SPEAKER_22]: 22, maybe one or two were 25, maybe.
[SPEAKER_22]: But there was no 29.6 ones there.
[SPEAKER_16]: What varietal was that 29.6?
[SPEAKER_16]: 29%.
[SPEAKER_16]: Metanusky and Thunderfuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, ATN, when we first started
and we first got into everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: we learned pretty quickly that Sigma
Aldrich's standards are trash and that
[SPEAKER_05]: they weren't correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's Sigma fucking Aldrich,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you got to- Not only Sigma
Aldrich, it's also- They buy them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigma Aldrich is just a middle man.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't make anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just have a chemical warehouse and
shuffle around one purchase order from one
[SPEAKER_14]: client to another.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're buying basically the quality of
what came in and other people are able to
[SPEAKER_14]: produce.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Addison, that's not a problem today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as you know, you need a DEA
license to basically delve out those
[SPEAKER_14]: standards.
[SPEAKER_14]: So those standards cost an awful lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do end up spoiling, especially the
cannabinoid acid standards.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're only good for like, I don't know,
I think they're good for just a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: months and you have to keep them frozen.
But
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not handling nuclear waste.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just handling pure compounds here.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's an unnecessary tax, just like the
tax on 200 proof ethanol that handicaps
[SPEAKER_14]: the industry, just like 280 and all that
other bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: You are correct about the problem with
getting analytical samples.
[SPEAKER_22]: When we set up our lab 30 years ago,
what we did was we got our standards both
[SPEAKER_22]: from Geneva United Nations drug and we got
them from Sigma also.
[SPEAKER_22]: And one other place I forget.
[SPEAKER_22]: But what we did was we sent the sample to
Dr. Meshulam.
[SPEAKER_22]: We sent the sample to Dr. Brani.
[SPEAKER_22]: Addison and Dr. El Solay.
[SPEAKER_22]: And all four of our results came back.
[SPEAKER_22]: We felt pretty good, except that the
results were 88% instead of 99%.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Sam, just Sam, just turn away from
your mic slightly.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're breathing directly into your mic.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's interesting how we eventually
got to the point where we were just making
[SPEAKER_05]: standards because we couldn't trust what
we were getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just using a prepative HPLC and just
making our own shit at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's funny is Sigma Aldrich is one of
the best places to buy LSD from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go to Sigma Aldrich,
you can get their standard for LSD and
[SPEAKER_05]: just eat it and get lit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a really fucking cool trick
that you can pull.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody who has access, Sigma Aldrich
has some pretty dope LSD.
[SPEAKER_14]: I speak for myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to fill out a pretty extensive
question.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before you get an account with Sigma
Aldrich, make sure that you're licensed to
[SPEAKER_14]: handle anything that you get from them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they smell anything fishy,
you can't buy from Sigma Aldrich.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's plenty of chemical vendors.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can go up to Amazon these days
and buy chemicals.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, there's lots of places that you
can buy stuff from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mark, Sigma sold to me with no
problem.
[SPEAKER_22]: So they ate that clever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they sold to Steve.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know what the fuck we were doing
in the beginning.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now they're pretty careful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had to get re-approved and approved
and re-approved again with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're on a special list,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a company that actually sells the
columns that are widely used in the
[SPEAKER_14]: Shimazu system.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a company called ResTech up here in
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania has a schedule
[SPEAKER_14]: one license.
[SPEAKER_14]: And their standards are right on the
fucking money.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had to rely on their standards
now for machines for several labs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so ResTech, R-E-S-T-E-K, and their
Raptor column is one of the best columns
[SPEAKER_14]: that's out there for doing reverse phase
analysis.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's also several companies in Europe.
[SPEAKER_22]: And in Europe, the only thing that's
controlled is THC9 and Delta8.
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything else is available, including
THCP.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's odd, too, is that we ended up
getting standards from El Soli.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we settled on what you
were just saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ended up just getting them from
ResTech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of where they've gone at this
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest with everyone,
I had a great time at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really something that it was
training that allowed me to understand
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit when I heard it in the scientific
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it helped me also.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool because I went back and
through the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: learned chemistry, organic chem,
every one of the organic chem schedules
[SPEAKER_05]: you could get because we had PhDs there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And oddly enough, I was their boss,
which was fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just absorbed all that information
and learned so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got educated on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think testing's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think right now in our industry,
the testing industry is just rampant with
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to fit and monetize a
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_22]: And couple of simple facts that,
OK, the stuff that tested the highest,
[SPEAKER_22]: both the 28, 29, point six one and the
other ones that were even 25 or something,
[SPEAKER_22]: they weren't the preferred smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: People liked the stuff that was really
terpene rich and had a really loud flavor
[SPEAKER_22]: and had the right effects.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see worse.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll know that there can be very subtle
changes in the method used to make the
[SPEAKER_14]: sample that can give you very vastly
different results.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's probably more about sample
prep and the individual operator that's
[SPEAKER_14]: running the HPLC other than the machine
itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: The machine is basically going to the
concentration of the sample that you put
[SPEAKER_14]: in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if the tech is not knowledgeable
enough on how to make a sample and how to
[SPEAKER_14]: do a reproducible measurement and make
sure that sample is run on a machine,
[SPEAKER_14]: that's properly calibrated and their
baseline is nice and flat and doesn't drop
[SPEAKER_14]: off a cliff at the end and they're not
just running some quick method.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, HPLC can be very, very accurate.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I will say is that I'm actually
on the other side of the coin,
[SPEAKER_14]: Addison.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the testing industry on the
cannabis side has come a long way in the
[SPEAKER_14]: last handful of years compared to where it
was, say, like four or five years ago
[SPEAKER_14]: where, yeah, you send a similar sample to
10 different labs and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_14]: 10 different results because everyone runs
a different method.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's been a lot more
standardization.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sit on that group of people at ASTM
that's trying to standardize a set of
[SPEAKER_14]: tests.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen
on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But ultimately, at the end of the day,
there are very reliable methods for
[SPEAKER_07]: quantifying cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: that are present in Delta A that's made
from CBD are not baseline resolved by
[SPEAKER_14]: HPLC.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there needs to be a GC measurement to
basically look at the purity of D8 that's
[SPEAKER_14]: derived from CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the folks at KCA labs are actually
working on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, yeah, Addison, definitely like
Steep Hill was one of the first labs that
[SPEAKER_14]: sort of carry the flag of we really need
to do standardized good measurements.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of innovation and a lot of
people who have basically entered the
[SPEAKER_14]: testing industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do a lot of testing now,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how much testing you do.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I can tell you is when I send
samples to five or six different labs,
[SPEAKER_14]: I see correlation of results.
[SPEAKER_14]: I see that labs are actually getting their
acts together.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I send one sample to a lab and I
get one measurement, I can basically
[SPEAKER_14]: predict that measurement based on the own
HPLC measurement that we've made in our
[SPEAKER_14]: own lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the last thing I'll say is that I
think the more and more testing happens,
[SPEAKER_14]: the more and more weak sisters are going
to be knocked out because producers have
[SPEAKER_14]: to rely on good COAs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So their product is sellable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if their COA is not good, that means
they can't sell their product.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are relationships that are
starting to stratify between producers and
[SPEAKER_14]: testing labs in the industry because
they're getting more reproducible results.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're selling more product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the needle is moving
closer to actually characterizing these
[SPEAKER_14]: samples more accurately than they were,
say, just three or four or five years ago.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're right, Mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's even more than that because the
industry only started in 2008.
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact is that there's nothing unique
about cannabis that makes it different
[SPEAKER_14]: than some of the other foods that we eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you look at any food product or any
FDA label required, you can see that there
[SPEAKER_14]: are labs like Eurofins and other labs that
basically do measurements of food products
[SPEAKER_14]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of that is not only just the
standard regulation, but it's just also
[SPEAKER_14]: part of the marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Addison, what I would say,
too, is again, I think that where you guys
[SPEAKER_14]: were in assessing that there needed to be
a testing industry parallel with the
[SPEAKER_14]: producing of cannabis products,
I think that's where the vision was.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's like you can't just produce
stuff and not have third party testing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to produce it, and then you have
to throw it over the fence to a lab that's
[SPEAKER_14]: hopefully certified.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that means that their HPLCs are all
appropriately calibrated, and they've
[SPEAKER_14]: hired good people to run those HPLCs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the results you're going to get are
actually meaningful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, that loop is becoming more and
more productive.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we could ask AT&T, because AT&T's
business is basically a catalyst for that
[SPEAKER_14]: loop between producers and testing labs to
produce products that are legal and
[SPEAKER_14]: compliant under the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting?
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest problem is accurate labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more accurate that a lab is,
the better that they're going to reveal
[SPEAKER_05]: the issues that growers are having and
getting their potency up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, AT&T will tell you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The growers will shop their product to
different labs to get the highest THC
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage so that it sells better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll run the same sample at five
different labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they find that lab that's a
little loosey goosey, that bumps the
[SPEAKER_05]: higher numbers, that's their fucking lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're selecting based on that,
there's a problem with the system itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not regulated enough on the
laboratory side to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_05]: know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main problem there is the BCC in
California doesn't know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis testing is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got people in there that don't
know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When those guys are the ones that are
setting the rule, it creates this
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's our environment right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more accurate you are, when I talk to
labs, they're like, the more accurate that
[SPEAKER_05]: we are, the less customers we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we send them the test results,
that's the lowest of their, and they tell
[SPEAKER_05]: them this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The company tells the lab, oh man,
we love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have great pricing, but we can't use
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the test results come back fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's good, but everything we run
with you guys is low.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these guys, they take a little
longer to get it back, but we get higher
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a system that allows bullshit
to- In Washington, that happened and they
[SPEAKER_15]: actually called it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry to interrupt, but they closed down
one whole lab was running like 80% of the
[SPEAKER_15]: state.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single lab in Oregon went away
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: British Columbia last week, I'm talking to
Hatchell Labs over in Calgary,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're talking about they have to fit
6% THC on your rosin in order to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't fit, if you make,
so they have to buy the herb from a
[SPEAKER_01]: producer in faith, then bring it to their
laboratory, wash it, and then find a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's the one lab they work with
and it has to fit within that threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that you're saying is
unbelievably disheartening to a family
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer or a family grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you have like an investor
business that you can just fold and start
[SPEAKER_01]: a new one, it might be okay to play in
that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the breeders you're talking
about, Addison in California are family
[SPEAKER_01]: farm breeders and they can't just fold up
because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same here in the colonies in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would appreciate less regulation on
us if they don't have a system that's
[SPEAKER_01]: viable for us to play in, because
otherwise it's just, ah, it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste of energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, you're only dealing with this
snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's also the problem I have with
California cannabis is because once you
[SPEAKER_16]: have that snapshot in time, you have a
year to get rid of that product.
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, what we're seeing now is
we're about to see a huge glut here in
[SPEAKER_16]: California.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're seeing prices plummet from last
year's harvest because it's now harvest
[SPEAKER_16]: season.
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't seen this type of event.
[SPEAKER_16]: We saw it with Oregon, but it was right
after they harvested.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're seeing the opposite end in the
sense here in California is that we now
[SPEAKER_16]: have so much now old cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a snapshot of that cannabis in that
form, not how it actually comes in that
[SPEAKER_16]: form.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even in the form that it's tested,
that doesn't mean that that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: selling it at in the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a huge issue in the industry
because even this wonderful, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: water hash, et cetera, that I get still
has so much oxygen trapped in the
[SPEAKER_16]: container, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's still degradation that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially if you look at the jars of
ACE and the amount of oxygen, nobody's
[SPEAKER_16]: taking the time and doing 80, 20 nitrogen
CO2 shoot in to actually protect the
[SPEAKER_16]: flowers so that it doesn't actually
degrade, you know, and they're definitely
[SPEAKER_16]: not doing that at the concentrate level.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's no way, shape or form to actually
stabilize the product.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even its system itself is kind of
bullshit because they're only dealing with
[SPEAKER_16]: that snapshot in time when that particular
representative sample was tested,
[SPEAKER_16]: not what the actual person is receiving at
the time of their purchasing, which is the
[SPEAKER_16]: real market and the real reality.
[SPEAKER_16]: And a big problem then it goes beyond just
the, you know, the testing and the
[SPEAKER_16]: instability of testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's the also maintaining that
product consistently through the
[SPEAKER_16]: distribution centers and points all the
way till it gets to the individual person
[SPEAKER_16]: at the counter.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these things that you guys have
discussed have happened here are happening
[SPEAKER_11]: here in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people with their fresh frozen crops
in containers paying 1700 a month from,
[SPEAKER_11]: and they still have last year's crop
that's still fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have labs that are pumping numbers and
giving people better numbers than other
[SPEAKER_11]: labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we have a whole situation where
we have an industry of people selling
[SPEAKER_11]: produce that doesn't realize it's produce.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, first question is your
vault cooled.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, Oh, so all of your terpenes are
currently off gassing in your vault right
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're representing companies that are
only in the one to 1.5 terpene range in
[SPEAKER_11]: the first place instead of the three to
five exceptional range.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you don't have any movement.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no movement.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to keep this shit cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would tell people in the prairies to
build a fucking tunnel through the center
[SPEAKER_11]: of your building that goes into your vault
and pull the minus 40 degree Canadian air
[SPEAKER_11]: out of there into your vault.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because to keep all of this stuff at room
temperature is absolutely bat shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you imagine, Hey Addison, I'm going to
send you a container of spinach,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm not going to be cooling it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would get to Addison and it would be
liquid.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the produce business here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think Marcus is bringing up a really
good point into what ATN and also Dr. Mark
[SPEAKER_18]: was talking about.
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of us really, I think like from a
formulation standpoint, it's really
[SPEAKER_18]: important to have this snapshot,
but that snapshot is really limited.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's only so much is telling me.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can only, you know, be so educated to
make products that are based on a system
[SPEAKER_18]: that yes, to ATN's point is inherently
broken.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mark's, you know, working really hard,
hard behind the scenes to try to fill
[SPEAKER_18]: those holes and try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_18]: But then we have the responsibility of
everyone else, including ourselves for
[SPEAKER_18]: supply chain, which Marcus just,
just outlined, which is super important
[SPEAKER_18]: because once it leaves our hands,
it's really up to everyone else now to
[SPEAKER_18]: then have that same care and compassion to
make sure that this, this, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: these chemicals or this, these products,
I should say
[SPEAKER_18]: seems to be like walking on the moon these
days, but you know, I think it's,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's important that, you know,
if we can just agree on something at the,
[SPEAKER_18]: at the testing level, I think that would
really help.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then again, then I think we should
hold people to accountability on the
[SPEAKER_18]: supply chain aspect.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't have a freezer and you're,
you know, a distribution center,
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe, you know, there should be fines for
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, maybe there should be some
consequences for these people that are not
[SPEAKER_18]: taking the care that you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the advantage, Colin, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I always told people if, if you want an
advantage, freeze your shit, make it cold,
[SPEAKER_11]: make it as cold as possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it won't be able to be frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll just want to keep it really kind of
refrigerator cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're going to have to pay a couple
of prices by learning which ones are the
[SPEAKER_11]: right ones to freeze and which ones aren't
the right ones to freeze.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are going to have to get on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, supply chain is critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in every part of this
business,
[SPEAKER_05]: like thousand pound, they go from 85 to
200 bucks, depending on their viability.
[SPEAKER_05]: That hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else around it changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything changes except for that price.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we saw that, we were just like,
you know, wait a minute, I can still go to
[SPEAKER_05]: a grower and go, Hey, look, I can get you
950 bucks for a kid, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: for the, the, for the 2008 grams or
whatever the hell we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of guys, you know, when we go
into these grows and talk to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: if we're, if we're offering a farm $60 a
pound for wet material, they're profiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making money because they're not
having to dry it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making money because it's out of
there very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that model works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if they're getting 60 and we're able
to sell it for 85, there's room for us to
[SPEAKER_05]: do that with our partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're getting, if they're getting 60
and we're able to sell it for 200,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we give them more than 60.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now bring them up with us and say,
Hey, here's how you can get $80 a pound
[SPEAKER_05]: wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you add up those 80, those five 80,
you know, wet pounds, they equal more than
[SPEAKER_05]: what you'd get for a dry pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you start showing that and you show
that model and you understand the supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain that way, that's where you want to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where hash is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's the only thing in our
business that's doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is, is that, and that's the only place
that it's left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, BHO there's room in BHO at the
highest end of the market at the diamond
[SPEAKER_05]: end of the market, but there's only room
at the highest end of the market for BHL.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no other room at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to see where the room is and
then be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you know, a maker can buy
frozen pounds at $200 wet and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and put them out and sell them and still
make really great money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know that or understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're, they're just not
educated to the point where they have to
[SPEAKER_05]: trust and commit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we've done is introduced the
ability to say, Hey, on those 2000 pounds
[SPEAKER_05]: that are in the ground right there,
let me apply this model to it and see if
[SPEAKER_05]: it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll move more material.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll actually, what we think is that good
work is going to lower the price of hash
[SPEAKER_05]: slowly and make it more affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see BHO as a lower barrier of entry to
hash consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it costs less.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to get into.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll see guys sort of start to
step up their glass game because they
[SPEAKER_05]: start to understand that they have a piece
of terpene analysis equipment in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do I use that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what nail do I have?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the surface area and nail?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much air is coming through here?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I cap that air and control the
flow to get it to use my column that I
[SPEAKER_05]: have here to get, you know, it's like you
accelerate your understanding to the point
[SPEAKER_05]: where you start to only want to smoke very
good rosin because it's easy to clean up
[SPEAKER_05]: or melt because it has a different taste
and a different approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really where.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know this because we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the public and opening the public up
to this and starting to get them into it,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of money to be made.
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest problem in our industry is
that people don't use their brain and
[SPEAKER_05]: logic to figure out how to work with one
another and make things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we all make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone wants to crush and everyone wants
to control and be them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like what I love about hash is we
as a community are starting to teach
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody else collectively, not as a
master, but just as a learning,
[SPEAKER_05]: a learning entity that's moving forward,
that if we work together and we approach
[SPEAKER_05]: things in an open source way and we make
it so everyone can make money,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can do this for longer and we can do
this forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all do really fucking well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm sick and tired of these small
growers in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out that are wrecked and being
like, I'm not making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't make any money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop fucking lying, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're selling 50% of your harvest on the
black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're selling 50% the other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to look this way in order to
continue to do what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can either go full wreck or I
honestly, I think do both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did one before and I think do both until
you get caught, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Until you get in trouble because that's
always been our thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But look, there's more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking material being sold for fresh
frozen in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you produce all of that fresh frozen
into hash, you'd have five times the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of fucking hash that's being sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whose fault is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the BCC's issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I think a lawyer would be
able to prove in court that the BCC is
[SPEAKER_05]: complicit in drug smuggling because of
this reason, for this purpose,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're the ones that are
watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you see the numbers and you just made
$887 million on tax, okay, that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing more production to occur,
more sale to occur than what's going out
[SPEAKER_05]: into the actual dispensary, then you know
where that's going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're complicit in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're actually a part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what's happening in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to correct, just Addison,
it's now the DCC.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the department now.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's being consolidated into one.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's no longer just BCC.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to change our nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_16]: So people are aware we're talking about
now the Department of Cannabis Control,
[SPEAKER_16]: which we are now currently under 90-day
emergency regs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bigger and blinder than ever before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I also just agree with the community
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about Rosin and
with the pure certification that we
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of farms and also producers
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been our whole entire model
from the beginning was not a monetary
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more of a community model and how we
can all survive and be a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole thing is like, are we a business
in five more years from now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if not, all we're doing is just,
everything we're doing is just folly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recognize from the beginning that
solventless and nonchemical extractions
[SPEAKER_01]: were more valuable and more heady.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of our certification from the
beginning was only solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our farms, the only thing they
could have produced all these years was
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are really amazing companies
coming out and working solely with pure
[SPEAKER_01]: certified farms and getting it out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely doesn't solve the DCC or
the BCC issue, because the bottleneck is a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to have the fresh frozen
pounds is also sort of the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: starting a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking it out of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having vegetables fresh at the
market and getting us a penny per pound or
[SPEAKER_01]: a dollar per pound or freezing them or
beginning to preserve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beginning of preserving them and
making a value added product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice that those, and obviously the
terpenes are something that people really
[SPEAKER_01]: resonate with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that resonate has resin in it,
but resonating with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the early terpene mine
expansion times was going to Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day and talking to Dr. Kim
Run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Kim Run, Steve Hill is just such
an amazing mine at the time and just like
[SPEAKER_01]: a freaky hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved his depth and his
dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Reggie Gaudino is also a really
amusing person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone that came out of that and
went in different directions is something
[SPEAKER_01]: really valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Dr. Kim Run would be really
interesting to have on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where he's at these days.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's not a doctor at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: He does not have a PhD.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe he was a research
instructor at one of the local
[SPEAKER_14]: universities, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not a PhD, but I think, you know
what, I don't think he's a PhD,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he was a research instructor with Don
who is a PhD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Don kind of gets the bulk of the doctor
comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Kim Run is without question,
one of the most brilliant fucking mines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a great dude to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I talked earlier about learning,
I learned so much from Kim Run.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned so much from Don.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we would be sitting in my office
smoking hash with some of the biggest hash
[SPEAKER_05]: makers in this country or in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would just be high and we'd be
talking about something and we'd knock on
[SPEAKER_05]: the wall and we invite Kim Run in and then
Don would come in and then Reggie would be
[SPEAKER_05]: in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these weed guys would be asking
questions directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were getting this really amazing
kind of build of understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think you're right, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Kim Run's a doctor per se,
but I think he does have a doctorate in
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think he worked at UC Davis and I
think he was the guy that basically made
[SPEAKER_14]: all the reagents for all the undergrad and
graduate laboratories.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's got an incredible wealth of
experience at doing solution phase
[SPEAKER_14]: chemistry in terms of diluting stuff and
knowing what the right strengths are and
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I met him.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Pinsky introduced me to him early on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's like, oh, OK, here's a weed
nerd that you can go talk with and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we chatted at a high times cannabis
cup booth for several hours.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I mean, I think that what you
guys started there, certainly I think you
[SPEAKER_14]: guys were maybe a little bit ahead of
where SC was because I
[SPEAKER_07]: know really know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love their customer interface.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you set up an account at SC,
it's an HTML interface.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you can look at your data in real
time and see when it really comes in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, yeah, there's been a lot of,
I think, innovation on the customer
[SPEAKER_14]: service side of testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to just for you to speak
back to your point, SC Labs founder Josh
[SPEAKER_05]: was our chemist at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Josh Werzer, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We hired Josh Werzer, gave him his gave
him his first job in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after being with us for about
five or six months, he started to slow
[SPEAKER_05]: down the ability for our test results to
go out because he had started to found an
[SPEAKER_05]: investor to help work with him to start
another lab to compete with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Steep Hill was actually the first
cannabis testing lab in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go back to a article in the East
Bay Express that David Watson wrote,
[SPEAKER_05]: or no, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_05]: David the journalist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember his name, but he wrote
the first article because everyone always
[SPEAKER_05]: comes to me and they're like, oh,
this lab was the first or this lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, listen, when we opened Steep
Hill, that was when Paul Daley's guy there
[SPEAKER_05]: that did AMA.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_14]: You were working with David Lampack,
wasn't he one of the original folks?
[SPEAKER_05]: David Lampack and I, I was the head of the
Medical Cannabis Association, the director
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Medical Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had just got graded.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a dispensary in the Central Valley,
very, very aggressive area for cannabis at
[SPEAKER_05]: the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I woke up one morning and I saw an article
in the newspaper that said that the city
[SPEAKER_05]: of Oakdale that I lived in was in danger
of someone being able to open a dispensary
[SPEAKER_05]: because they didn't have the laws on the
books to protect them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time I put the fucking
newspaper down, I was in the car going
[SPEAKER_05]: over to the city to get a business license
for a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got the license.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sheriff's came in hard and heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got raped.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're in a pretty fucked up
position.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only money I had was from like six
pounds of weed I had inside of the fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: the lawnmower bag, the grass bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had six pounds of weed stashed in there
and that was the only money I had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had, I think I had like 35 grand out
and that someone owed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, you know, fucked at that point
because I'm getting rated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the DEA was all this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob Raich was, Hey, if you want to work,
I can give you a job at the Medical
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Association as a director.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I got to turn to activism at
this point, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get some attention on my case.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to draw some attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and started working with Rob there
as the director and David Lampack was on
[SPEAKER_05]: the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: David Lampack and I, Rob was like,
Hey, you guys should brainstorm about
[SPEAKER_05]: finding ways to create revenue for the,
for the medical cannabis association.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Dave sat down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went up to Dave's farm in Mendocino,
met with them, sat down and kind of just
[SPEAKER_05]: came up with some ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was, why don't we introduce
quality control to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason was, is because I had just
gotten in an argument with the sheriff
[SPEAKER_05]: because he was doing a, a news conference
and saying that, you know, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: dangerous because it's tainted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have other drugs in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in me and Dave's conversation,
I'm like, you know, and this fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: sheriff is saying there's other drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no other fucking drugs in weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like who the fuck gives you other free
drugs in your weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's bullshit, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and Dave's like, well,
the only way we could prove it is if we
[SPEAKER_05]: did testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, Oh, so I walk up to the dry
erase board and I'm like testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was on the board, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and I think I actually have in a
phone somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I actually have it on one of my
computers, that picture of that dry erase
[SPEAKER_05]: board that says testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says all these different ideas on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we left there, we kind of just
said, Hey, you know, let's try to do some
[SPEAKER_05]: testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I left Dave and said, that's what we need
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that asshole about five days later
calls me up and he says, Hey, I got us a
[SPEAKER_05]: space in Emeryville.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going down to fucking, we're going
down to pick a GC up in the Bay at the,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was, I don't know who it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who our first GC was from,
but we go and we, we literally,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, it was Agilent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We drove down to Agilent and I'm like,
what the fuck's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: He picks me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I'm in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He picks me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We drive to Agilent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pick up this fucking machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the fuck we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brings me back to the spot that we
leased, which ended up being the original
[SPEAKER_05]: steep hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought the machine in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found a chemist on, on Craig's list.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lo and behold, Etienne and
Debbie, got involved and what was his
[SPEAKER_05]: name?
[SPEAKER_05]: John Gilmore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Gilmore just put up the money and
approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Gilmore went to Paul Daly and said,
these guys have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put the money behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be willing to help these guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paul Daly, who was working with Sasha
Shulgin at the time, Paul Daly came over
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's how we met Sasha and shot Sasha
came and they both were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys are sweet little kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they sat us down and they looked at
all of our shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and thank you Etienne, because our
numbers were trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Etienne was paying us to do tests and our
numbers are trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So Etienne, Etienne ultimately seated
steep hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve D'Angelo at Harborside seated steep,
seated steep hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys, we didn't know what we were
doing, but then once Paul got involved and
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul came in, we had the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul was able to reach out to the rest of
the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, you know, we got everybody
involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think every single cannabis
chemist of any type at that point,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're so interested from a Shulam all the
way into El Soli.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the network to kind of get
these guys involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of those guys got involved in
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Etienne, a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say that, that it's crazy
that Microsoft essentially seated steep
[SPEAKER_05]: hill because the money that John Gilmore
made from selling sun systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is what funded steep hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So oddly enough, Microsoft funded the
quality control component of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like steep hill came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the Sasha, Sasha Shulgin
component is very significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't, I mean, I can't even, I'm so,
I'm more honored to be Nate, to be thanked
[SPEAKER_05]: in those books that Paul wrote than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I've ever done in my career ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that to me, like having those
books up there and I take those out and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, just seeing my stupid little
name in there as like a shout out of
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody involved that to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, how would it have come
together?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, when I would take
MDA, I'd be like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like all this comes so full circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and even with the fresh frozen thing,
even with the legends thing now,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's just an energy that's,
that's outside of all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's feeding us this energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just a conduit to this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I don't know where I get the energy
to do half this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's definitely, you know,
when I look at, we look at the last year,
[SPEAKER_05]: how the fuck did we survive that year and
come out talking to Kevin who was here
[SPEAKER_05]: with me, you know, we both were sitting
here, struggling, working our asses off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then somehow some way it happens and
it clicks in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything's moving and the work that
you did before happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I'm just rambling,
but this is the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that compound that made this
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the, and it's done it with other
compounds because the group of people are
[SPEAKER_05]: compound guys, which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Jeffrey Rayburn and Samantha Miller in
there or is it Jeffrey Rayburn and
[SPEAKER_01]: Samantha Miller came after a little after
that or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeffrey came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where it went from, it went from,
from Paul Daly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then Jehan Marku got involved on the micro
side because he was at UCSF.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we were able to expand micro
testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was about the, at about the same
time that those aspergillosis patients had
[SPEAKER_05]: died from consuming medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the, and the, the people that were
researching the death went back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: person's house, got the cannabis,
tested it, saw that it had aspergillosis
[SPEAKER_05]: and fusarium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they figured out that that's how
the immune deficient patient died.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was one of the things that
actually allowed us to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: support from San Francisco to be able to
push cannabis testing forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we did this, this is when
dispensaries were getting rated left and
[SPEAKER_05]: right, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of came out and we're like,
ah, fuck, you know, me and Dave sat there
[SPEAKER_05]: one day and I'm like, if you think being a
grower is a target, then if I think being
[SPEAKER_05]: a dispensary owner was a target,
we just made the biggest fucking target
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're dragging mashulam into this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're dragging all these other chemists
into this now and the government hates
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a minute there, I thought we were
going to get rated and wiped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they were going to hit the
chemists with a $10,000 per sample,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were going to wipe the whole
thing the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But luckily for us, they were too focused
on other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the fact that testing got
through, not because of the steep hill,
[SPEAKER_05]: because of everybody that got involved,
you know, SC labs later on, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Halent, all these guys that got involved.
[SPEAKER_16]: The lab I worked with, the lab I worked
with stopped working because it was just
[SPEAKER_16]: so risky.
[SPEAKER_16]: Their investors didn't want to take the
risks on their six UV-8 PLCs because they
[SPEAKER_16]: were being leased, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's an ungodly amount of money.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, I brought Arno over and the
reason that I worked on a suspended
[SPEAKER_16]: solution was because of the $10,000 fine
per test.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we worked with Arno who did the
testing solutions for the Dutch
[SPEAKER_16]: government, brought him stateside and
worked with our lab after we inadvertently
[SPEAKER_16]: we fired Steve Hill because we weren't
happy with the numbers.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I worked then with Ethan
Russo helped find me Arno.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Arno, we worked on actually
getting cannabis suspended in a hundred
[SPEAKER_16]: percent alcohol so that now it was a
testing solution.
[SPEAKER_16]: So now it was legal to take into a
dispensary, I mean, pardon me,
[SPEAKER_16]: into a laboratory and you would no longer
be subject to that $10,000 fine per test.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they were mental steps along the way
once you took those initial steps that
[SPEAKER_16]: many of us around saw that we needed to
fill that are now standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it took a village, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took everybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: Addison, what was the name of the other
lab besides Steve Hill that eventually
[SPEAKER_22]: fused together?
[SPEAKER_22]: Talent?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Halent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Halent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where Kim Ron and Don came from,
which was sort of a, it was built out of
[SPEAKER_05]: UC Davis, which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they were a UC Davis lab that
came in a bit after SC and they pushed
[SPEAKER_05]: things very far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they were the one main reason why I
think the merger, the merger with them is
[SPEAKER_05]: what helps people survive to the point
where it was able to rip off all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: founders and be the company that is now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the juice that they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right after that was when we started our
certification because we started our
[SPEAKER_01]: certification based off the testing that
was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the early, you guys at Steve
Hill, he did a sleeper study, I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: where you went out and bought a bunch of
pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there was like,
you know, talk about people getting
[SPEAKER_01]: lesions and they're, you know,
and they're there, you know, when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad and getting lesions in their,
their lungs and whatnot and a clean green
[SPEAKER_01]: started a, you know, a certification down
there, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started it right after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ours was free because we were farmers
and producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just recognize that people that
were caring for the earth and bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: living soils and putting their plants into
the earth and being a positive impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like the revelation of
finding out cannabis was good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The revelation of realizing that you could
grow cannabis in harmony with the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and then produce resin that was of higher
quality than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this amazing full circle thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the revelation of laboratories and
testing as ill as they are, as we stated
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, you know, did help bring cannabis
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you add in heavy metals now
and pesticide residues and glyphosate
[SPEAKER_01]: residues, you know, that, that really also
completes the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love for, you know, Canada to
learn how to get rid of their microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: testing up here and get more towards just
human pathogenic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that might be one of the
things that actually saves the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry up here in Canada, because you'll
be hard pressed to find quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of any licensed producer in
Canada, because of the microbial testing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's required, which is even more
stringent than when it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have all kinds of different,
different things that they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gamma radiation is one and light,
light therapy is another, and every single
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those things diminishes the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole entire purpose of this
conversation and rosin and everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: how to bring terpenes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like bringing everything up
so that we can get smacked in the face
[SPEAKER_01]: with a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love for, you know,
the intelligence of this community to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to reach out to people in Canada
and to different policymakers as we
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to form our federal legislation
or make sure in America, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as those federal legislations get formed,
that, you know, you don't get crushed with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbial, you know, dilemma,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's just one of the
things, one of the things in our area,
[SPEAKER_01]: also packaging and trash and all those
types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there's a lot to learn from the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulation is tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, they try to use an approach where,
you know, they're protecting the people,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the same time, it never translates
into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always, it's always so limiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, who the fuck in their right mind
would limit microbes in a grow room?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in the finished product?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of biological inputs that you
can't use legally in your grow as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: soil inputs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have everything approved,
every single input, which in some cases
[SPEAKER_01]: can be extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things like EM and mycorrhizal
fungi, and those things for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: were not allowed over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are becoming available and
are being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some really forward thinking
LPs in Canada doing work to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, big ups to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that, like you said,
we're trying to find as much as we can in
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant and that leads us to rosin,
that leads us to melt in the most purest
[SPEAKER_05]: form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, in order to get there,
for so many years, it was just isolation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that it's so open and there's so
many distractions and there's so much
[SPEAKER_05]: going on, the cream is rising to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I, you know, I'm on Instagram
all the time just posting stupid shit and
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of, you know, it's a distraction
that allows me to kind of take away from
[SPEAKER_05]: the work and the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the same time, you see people that
are so invested that think that our
[SPEAKER_05]: industry is in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, if anyone thinks our
industry is in Instagram, you're out of
[SPEAKER_05]: your fucking mind, because you may see one
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for us, what our industry is to me is
when I drive up and I'm trying to find my
[SPEAKER_05]: way to this piece of property.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I get to the property and I get
there and I see the greenhouses and I see
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants and I, you know, and you get
the tour and you see everything and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you get to the lab tour maybe and you see
the material and you're with the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's what this industry is
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I love about Legends and I
love about what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to put those 25 makers with
their guests in a room with no fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: phone, no camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that to me is like every person I've
talked to on the phone that when I call
[SPEAKER_05]: them to tell them about the event,
they're like, oh fuck, thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the only place where we get
that nowadays is at a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you go to a comedy show,
they take your phone now because they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want you filming and showing the
person's comedy before they're ready to
[SPEAKER_05]: release it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that by taking that away from
it and removing that from it and putting
[SPEAKER_07]: people more in front of each other
[SPEAKER_05]: of love and kindness to push the message
of working together, because the more that
[SPEAKER_05]: and of health and people's health,
you know, gut health, foot health,
[SPEAKER_05]: all those things, that shit is going to
make it so you can keep doing what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing for longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be here and be able to
give these blessings to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how many hash makers I talk to
now that are like, oh, what's up,
[SPEAKER_05]: bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just getting ready to go into the gym.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't hear that years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these guys are biohacking.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are working, you know,
straight, straight or get our straight
[SPEAKER_05]: organics just started a whole thing with a
straight, you know, at, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: working out and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing it come into our industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing health become more important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's starting to align with what we've
always known as that cannabis is healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's a healthy way of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, we're getting to sit in
that position.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sit now as cannabis guys, I sit now
with like, biohackers dudes that are like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, and they know cannabis is good for,
for your health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those dudes are, you know,
making a bunch of splash and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: money and their industries are in line
with our industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're guys that make that sell compound
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how many guys we look at and
talk to that are, that are the top fitness
[SPEAKER_05]: guys in the country and they dab or they
use tinctures or they use cannabis or
[SPEAKER_05]: they're using CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's all growing, you know,
it's because the, you know, it's because
[SPEAKER_18]: it, it touches the end of the EC,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, it's the same, you know,
when you're, when you're running,
[SPEAKER_18]: you're, you're the same receptors are
firing off and you're, you're feeling
[SPEAKER_18]: these same exact things.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why we're drawn to them.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, you know, I've always looked at
cannabis as some sort of a biohacking
[SPEAKER_18]: agent.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like you're, you're, you're isolating
these compounds and you can put them back
[SPEAKER_18]: together or you can allow the,
you know, nature's chemists as I call it
[SPEAKER_18]: to kind of guide you and let specific
cultivars do it for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So totally agree.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's a lot to look at and,
and, you know, explore in that alone.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's cool to see people,
you know, excited about cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabinoid therapy in general.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, it's been, I mean, I can't imagine
what Sam has seen through his time,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, let alone what we're seeing
right now in contemporary times,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think weed workouts are key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the ganja has to be
regeneratively grown and healthy to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you know, you're just
processing the residue chemicals and that
[SPEAKER_01]: really doesn't serve you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in moving forward, like health and
ganja go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also started DEM pure athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a whole other realm called DEM
pure athletes where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of, you know, top athletes in the
world don't really understand nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't really understand detoxing,
specifically injury healing and injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, in a lot of
professional sports, you can't bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because they are still testing
THC levels for performance, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of, uh, top athletes are turning
towards cannabis during their downtime,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that it's going to be out of their
system within two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're turning to anything that they
can to be able to utilize plant medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know that their healing is
going to be in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that when they go back into the
doctor, check that bone injury when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be putting on another
cast, they don't have to go on and get
[SPEAKER_00]: that second cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go and start working on their
livelihood, which is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think it's crazy that so many
doctors don't even ask about that fast
[SPEAKER_00]: healing or how they even got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor do their sponsors even want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Chinese bone break soup and bone
knitting and bone healing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bones actually come together pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which comes back into the compound of
plant medicine, which is exactly what you
[SPEAKER_00]: all are just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening, but I've been doing a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how ironic is it that the only sport
that allows cannabis now is the most
[SPEAKER_05]: brutal sport that you could be involved
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the UFC is the only sport that allows
you to test positive for THC and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not banned from the sport.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I think about it, I'm like,
how come?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is a fucking neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been proven to be a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had six concussions in my life from
being a professional snowboarder,
[SPEAKER_05]: from being an athlete in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six times I've had concussions.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brain shouldn't be working the way that
it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: But cannabis as a neuro,
[SPEAKER_07]: big money grabbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also the military.
[SPEAKER_16]: The military, we could be using CBD rich
components right after a TBI, a traumatic
[SPEAKER_16]: brain injury for those who aren't aware,
which is a huge component.
[SPEAKER_16]: The most recent wars is the large
explosions that cause immediate concussive
[SPEAKER_16]: and huge injuries and costs over time,
which if they were given something CBD
[SPEAKER_16]: rich right out the gate, like they would
give some of the other medications.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I was given morphine when I went
down.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think you would see a
significant change that we want to see.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's one of the thresholds we're
pushing for.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's a different methodology,
which I think it may permeate through the
[SPEAKER_16]: private market of an NFL or a UFC before.
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, it will make that crack
hole through the veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's happening and that's where it's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's where because if you
look at the NBA and you look at there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: weird thing going on where the NBA is very
popular in China, very popular in Japan in
[SPEAKER_05]: those places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you look at what Kobe Bryant or what
is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the greatest basketball player
in the world got into a weird situation
[SPEAKER_05]: when he was criticizing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is, is that when you look at big
sports, if big sports start to allow
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis to come in, that's the acceptance
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the breakthrough for the rest of
it, because there's so much money behind
[SPEAKER_05]: that end of it and that entertainment
value.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the point is that we're seeing it
and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: we do well from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my biggest fear is that like,
you know, when Johnson and Johnson decides
[SPEAKER_05]: to compete with us, it becomes a different
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'll be a different thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, hey, if I have to go live
in the woods and in fucking Alaska or
[SPEAKER_05]: something somewhere so I can grow and
enjoy can't or even a better region and
[SPEAKER_05]: have guns and protect myself, I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have enough veterans in our
country that will nothing's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: change in that way in a sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all, you know, heading in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are the signs like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I saw the UFC make that decision and
then I'm watching post fight conferences
[SPEAKER_05]: and fucking ideas of smoking joints on the
stage, I'm like, yeah, you have that
[SPEAKER_16]: golden hour once you get that that TPI to
actually stop as much damage as you
[SPEAKER_16]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really critical that, you know,
they find or start to create those
[SPEAKER_16]: specific types of point of attack
mechanisms specifically with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's a new frontier.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I'm saying it's most likely
through the private scenario, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_16]: the VA is the largest medical system in
the world currently.
[SPEAKER_16]: So and, you know, government does hold a
patent, you know.
[SPEAKER_16]: So at the same time, there's a lot of big
things at play here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, let's not forget,
we still got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, one of the forbidden
cures in being healthy is the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, you know, and it gets talked
about and then it gets forgotten about and
[SPEAKER_01]: then talked and forgotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start realizing, you know,
wow, when you put the two, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: cordyceps for one was one of the Russian,
I think it was the Russian wrestling team
[SPEAKER_01]: or something, or the weightlifting team
that couldn't be beaten through the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of their big things was,
you know, taking cordyceps and chaga as a
[SPEAKER_01]: daily nutritional supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now put up our microcanna caps and,
and putting their polypores are for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part, you know, of course,
there's tons of people to understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the polypore medicine is not written
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a thing that's studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here getting ready for a
lockdown, you know, and we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: magical medicinal compounds in the forest,
which they want to fire smart and get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the branches and get rid of the
polypores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I don't know what world I live
in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's really important,
you know, as we're talking about isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, we also need to recognize that
if we're going to be isolating a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, we could be getting into
detriment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear a lot about like, isolating,
you know, parts of the industry and what
[SPEAKER_00]: what the federal government is going to
start wanting us to do is not talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other is that the distributor is not
talking to the, to the grower and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower is not talking to the breeder,
but our success in our industry has been
[SPEAKER_00]: holistic in a manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we've been so successful
and the reason why we still have our
[SPEAKER_00]: health and wellbeing and we're still
having beautiful relationships with this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is because we've looked at all
attributes of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Addison, what you were saying
before is that, you know, a grower before
[SPEAKER_00]: had to have the knowing of what was going
on with their distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, yay, you know,
it's going out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates sort of this isolating
feeling and a disconnect that is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to help out the legacy growers or the
legacy breeders or the legacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, extractors or even the
cannabinoids or the health and wellbeing
[SPEAKER_00]: or the message of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't always have full access and
full communication with all parts of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, industry and, and unfortunately
right now I call it an out industry
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like we could do so much
better, but these conversations are really
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people say, oh, you know,
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's been uncovered by
Addison today or, or has been uncovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, consistently by Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, continuing to uncover
the veils of separatism that they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put us into these different compartments
is going to be the death of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Competition with each other is going to be
the death of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to know what's going on and
bring each other up with the good
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are happening, of course,
surrounding health and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just did, I just had my 48th
birthday the other day and did 48 pushups
[SPEAKER_01]: in a row while smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday to you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy 48th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And happy birthday to you and getting the
kid out and everything and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just family birthday is
going on in your world too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, and also Mike, big up to Mike
and his happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: And happy belated birthday to Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was what, three weeks ago or
five weeks ago, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, and also while we're at it,
holy shit, shout out to fucking Frenchy
[SPEAKER_11]: Canole.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first hash church we've had
since Frenchy's passing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be rough.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be rough for us to not mention
Frenchy Canole, a true hash aficionado and
[SPEAKER_11]: lover of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I, I've known Frenchy for
quite a few years and bumped into him many
[SPEAKER_11]: times and he's been on hash church.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we kind of saw things a little
differently, but we're always able to get
[SPEAKER_11]: together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through our love of hashish.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just nice to see everyone talk
so nice about him.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, all the pictures that
circulated about of him.
[SPEAKER_11]: I realized I don't even think I have a
picture where Frenchy wasn't just like
[SPEAKER_11]: this, like this with a huge shit eating
grin on his face.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, I also, I got to speak
French with Frenchy because I am French
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's my other language that I speak.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I always had that going with Frenchy
that a lot of people didn't really have,
[SPEAKER_11]: which was I could speak his his native
tongue.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone else that wants to say beautiful
things about Frenchy?
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, please do.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a beautiful ceremony.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was honored by his wife to be
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of good people I've met in
this movement.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is very, yeah, he was one of
those people who made me smile,
[SPEAKER_16]: made me laugh, always had the most shit
eating grin on his face.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as much of his love for cannabis,
he had a love for chocolate.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he and I would speak and love
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I got to ask him my 200
cannabis questions, of which a lot of you
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to get on at some point and also
love to get you on our VAC roundtables.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I got to ask him 200
questions about cannabis and just they're
[SPEAKER_16]: all specific.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just such a fun time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we went over to get high.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we just got so engrossed in the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: And his wife was recording us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was very small.
[SPEAKER_16]: And intimate and very fun.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it wasn't until I was like on 150th
question that we're like, we should
[SPEAKER_16]: probably get high.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we forgot to get high.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we shished up and,
you know, we finally arrived there.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, from the first time he came
and met me, which was over a decade ago,
[SPEAKER_16]: I was one of the first people he came in
the Bay and talked to.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he was, you know, because of,
you know, the known of BPG.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I looked at his hash and said,
we're not not ready for this.
[SPEAKER_16]: The industry is not ready for this.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't afford this compared to the
realities of what we were seeing at the
[SPEAKER_16]: time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just kind of gave him the honest lay
of the land.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I told him his hash was great.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he always appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's like, I always appreciated your
honesty.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we've all tried the French
accent, you know, so I'm amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And every time I even, you know,
I'm from Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Cajun.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I had a hard time hearing him.
[SPEAKER_16]: And his French, depending was,
I mean, I don't know about you,
[SPEAKER_16]: I speak French too, but it was definitely
sometimes some words, depending on how
[SPEAKER_16]: they were stated, you were like,
what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Try that in another language.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was certainly not, it was
certainly not Québécois French.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very, very falsé, falsé.
[SPEAKER_16]: But his stories and especially to hear
over the years, all the different,
[SPEAKER_16]: his travels were amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the incredible risks that he took.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think an American could have
gotten away with some of the shit that he
[SPEAKER_16]: did.
[SPEAKER_16]: But he was just an amazing spirit.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just, it hurt to lose him.
[SPEAKER_16]: It still hurts.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will miss him.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will miss him, especially when I see him
at the, when I don't see him at the
[SPEAKER_16]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm going to stop because I'm about to
cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just did a strain review for
the upcoming skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had talked to Kimberly and OCN,
if we could name an incredible hashtrain
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been working on for about
three, four years now, after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went on and on about what the name
was going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just launching the new strain
called Frenchy's Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Frenchy's Force is because he
was such a force, such an incredible force
[SPEAKER_00]: of tenacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I had said, and we were also so
incredibly honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Kimberly, for allowing
us to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honored to speak at his memorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel like tenacity was it,
man, when he was coming up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was coming for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have your A game on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better wipe those, you know,
eye boogers out of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better roll them up because he's
coming for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to be talking about what,
you know, you're up to, what we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future, all the 10 billion things
that need to be checked off the list to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the farmers up there to make sure that
the industry was still working to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was community built and community
monitored and community run.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could and if you can die with
all of that work seriously being put out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the universal flow and it being
circulated to where it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative and it's growing new ideas
and new bounty and and it's creating all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this health and wealth and knowledge
for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, that's all that we can
ever ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you only got one life to
live, shit, live it like Frenchy because
[SPEAKER_00]: he just really took every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not surprising to me,
you know, maybe he did die too young
[SPEAKER_00]: because every single day was like three
days, every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was like six days, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also really brought home,
you know, that connection to the farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: and the resident, you know, and he always
said from the beginning, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can not do any of this without the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also bringing in and bringing in the
Appalachia and terroir and that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor palette, you know, that whole like
true connoisseur, you know, way of
[SPEAKER_01]: connecting with the plant and the
resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were really blessed
because he really took on the pure the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure certification and the farmers and
really recognized, you know, how how
[SPEAKER_01]: having a connection with them was like he
came to our hive gathering at Heartwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, and he was like,
I thought I was coming here for you and
[SPEAKER_01]: here to just make it awesome and be
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the weekend at the hive
gathering, he was just like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: my God, I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just felt so full in his heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't an industry thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a heart thing like you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We argued.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a thing of, you know,
content and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also at the regenerative
cannabis, you know, events that we did,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had some also some really beautiful
conversations with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was always ready to rock the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that and in that, I want to say
somehow there was still heart and soul and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was still room for being wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to find the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in his way of being like so
steadfast on his path, he even evolved and
[SPEAKER_01]: started using freeze dryers and started
using you know, mechanical separators and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even recognizing Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, huge love to Frenchy,
you know, for upholding the roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also evolving with the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a true legend of hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a passionate disruptor,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he had such like I remember my my my
memories of him are more visual.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like he would always he'd have like
something rolled up and he'd kind of be
[SPEAKER_05]: leaning in.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd always be close to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he always wanted to communicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was just like any time I ever saw
him, I didn't know him very well,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we knew each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: But every any time I ever saw him,
he always like came to you, give you a
[SPEAKER_05]: hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'd see him like float away and
do the same thing to every booth in the
[SPEAKER_05]: place with every and like he just shared
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even to like I'd be at the High Times
Cup and it would be like I'd see Frenchy
[SPEAKER_07]: or you know, LA gangster grove.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dudes and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd be like, I see those dudes and
I'd see him to the next booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just such a person that that I
mean, his passion was tough to be because
[SPEAKER_05]: he but also just when it comes to leaving
a legacy, every hash maker that I talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: now, that's whether it's a try hard,
a guy who's just kind of getting into it
[SPEAKER_05]: and figuring it out or like a legendary
person that they always when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they know who Frenchy is and
they and they all know about temple balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is because he was such an
educator, like the dude was always
[SPEAKER_05]: teaching people all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would argue with you, you know,
he might mean mine and his argument was
[SPEAKER_05]: that like, I call everything that's a
concentrate hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, that's hash, like they even have
a food that's kind of named after it,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's a mix of things like,
and we would have this great argument of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, but like, he's just such a such a
beautiful person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to finish off, we're going to be doing
a moment of silence for Frenchy at the
[SPEAKER_05]: legends dinner, we're going to we've
invited heritage, we've invited his family
[SPEAKER_05]: to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be it'll be dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they'll be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big love to Lena, who's carrying on his
traditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, one of his number one
helpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, there's the dank
touches, all these other people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, a huge part of his realm
and have continued on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, big love to Lena and
Kimberly and OCN.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it'll be it'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be a legends will be great
in the sense where we're able to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, take a moment to show him some
love, but then also include include his
[SPEAKER_07]: guys with us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that, Addison, thank you so much for
continuing to bring the conversation back
[SPEAKER_00]: to community to bring the conversation
back to the heart center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the guiding light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much gratitude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is, you know, as we're at Oh,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like I get that from hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to shout out sub cool,
who is definitely kind of how I heard
[SPEAKER_11]: about first Matt rise and then eventually
sub cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Biggity Dank just had written this in
the chat room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hadn't heard a Frenchy until he hooked
up with sub cool and cannabis aficionado
[SPEAKER_11]: and did the hunters of the dank with TC.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that was kind of how I heard
about Frenchy for the first time was
[SPEAKER_11]: through sub cool who I had known like
really since like, geez, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_11]: Colin, when were we on those chats?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that like in the like 99 or something?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, like, so can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was true stoners, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like true stoners and then also
laughing moon and then laughing moon
[SPEAKER_18]: eventually became overgrown.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, so on and so forth,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I mean, he was like one of the
first guys that I think as a breeder that
[SPEAKER_18]: was working with different varieties.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, all of his stuff was like,
just, I mean, not all of it yielded well,
[SPEAKER_18]: but it was like the resume was incredible.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like all of the resin was just
like, always really top notch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's one of the things I always had
to give up the sub and why I always had a
[SPEAKER_11]: good relationship with Bob, even as he was
kind of having his own Internet dramas and
[SPEAKER_11]: all, there was always people like,
oh, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, you know, I don't have a relationship
with him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than the fact when I get together
with his residence killer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And every time I run the shit,
no matter who threw it, it's also killer.
[SPEAKER_16]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: So cool was one of the first ones to sell
dispensary seeds to in the early days.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, he was the first one of the
first because earlier on it was clones.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know because I worked for Ed,
I was as general manager.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was pushing out 5,000 clones a week in
the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were no seeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it wasn't until I was then finally
working at BPG that, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: people like him actually would come in and
actually have seeds or take the chance to
[SPEAKER_16]: come in and actually have seeds available
so that people could grow something
[SPEAKER_16]: besides the standard genetics that we had.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you people were talking earlier
about Cali orange, we were the main
[SPEAKER_16]: perpetrators of that genetic in the Bay
area for years.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, it was all about getting
genetics out.
[SPEAKER_16]: But sub cool was one of the early OGs for
us here in the California dispensary scene
[SPEAKER_16]: to get seeded genetics out there because
none of the EU seeders were playing in
[SPEAKER_16]: America or trying to until, you know,
decade later.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was so cool and it was bog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the the two that I remember you
could get and like the dispensaries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And funny enough, those were two of my
first like customers.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually high grade who was from
Overgrow and he did these bubbler buckets.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was like, like if you were on those
sites back then, you knew who high grade
[SPEAKER_11]: was.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, he was my first customer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And afterwards, I think about a year into
it, he ended up getting busted and going
[SPEAKER_11]: to jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kept I would like send him magazines
and commissary money and stuff to kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: keep them going.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then you had sub cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: You had bog.
[SPEAKER_11]: You had all these guys that were growing
the dank strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way I was selling it to them was I
was like, listen, everyone thinks their
[SPEAKER_11]: shit's the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: But these bags are going to be like the
word of God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you don't believe in God,
they'll be the word of whatever you do
[SPEAKER_11]: believe in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you run your material through
these bags, your resin will not be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: hide from you once you've unveiled it from
everything else that was present.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sub cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I was talking to this about
this with Addison today, when,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I first started doing this,
I caught Sam's attention because not many
[SPEAKER_11]: people were doing what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, then when Matt Rice came out and
then eventually naked team, they caught my
[SPEAKER_11]: attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, what are these guys doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: What I've learned over the years from all
of these unique characters?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we might be able to follow clean
SOPs and have chef like standards.
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, what we have is an old fact
read that allows us to track down
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible breeders and growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And suddenly, when you're running material
like that, because I remember the first
[SPEAKER_11]: four or five, six times I ran material
through bags, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it wasn't until Breeder Steve was
like, I got some shishkeberry,
[SPEAKER_11]: the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, ooh, the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my favorite line of the red and
the yellow Afghan that were used to
[SPEAKER_11]: produce the two phenos of shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the first time I ran that and
actually saw full melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: And prior to that, I had only ever seen
full melt in like Sam's bong when Rob
[SPEAKER_11]: puffed me down in this Thai restaurant in
Amsterdam and said, if it don't bubble,
[SPEAKER_11]: it ain't worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I watched it all boiling and bubbling.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh my God, I have to find
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It took me, it took me almost four years
to find that because I saw it in 95.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I didn't have it myself till
around like the end of 98, the start of
[SPEAKER_11]: 99, which is when Fresh Hatties and Bubble
Bags was founded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to come in and put in a
beautiful word because we were talking so
[SPEAKER_00]: much about Frenchy and then came on with
Sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about someone who was out there
incredibly passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also about the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not something I say very often,
but he didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciated that about him
because that was sort of the energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to push forward for the genetics to
be able to get out there, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: information to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came up with his, you know,
sub soil recipe, which was organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did start to bring the term organic to
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much, you know, I became.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, we always say that people
can't change or that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we stick with something and we may stay
with it our whole lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became really close to Sub after his
house burned down and the heart and soul
[SPEAKER_00]: that he came to in his life was just
astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had so much love for the life
that he lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got to Miss Jill because
we're talking a lot about his genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she was a big part of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just just so much love for
for being human and ending with with heart
[SPEAKER_00]: and soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got to travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he had a great impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: He definitely I mean, so cool was that was
like the first real, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a laser point focus on a specific
flavor that for me, for like to some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that I tasted from him,
it was like so different from like an
[SPEAKER_05]: African Danny or anything else,
because it had such a really interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor to all his stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then when it came to like,
I think maybe the first purple hash I ever
[SPEAKER_05]: saw was was was when Matt Rice ran some of
his stuff and it was and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, shit, what's hash can be purple?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, so he definitely had a strong
influence on on everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think other guys at the same time
were like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking we're like DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, his stuff was was cracking at
the same time, Soma.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was I was nothing changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was an indoor grower that was setting up
houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddies were were real estate dudes
that were loan officers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were just they were building track
houses in the in the Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just go and they'd get a new
house and I'd go in and rip the thing
[SPEAKER_05]: apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And boom, they're set up to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and I had a landscape company and I
would just go there and mow the lawn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had this system set up and I did
that in my life changed when I found New
[SPEAKER_05]: York City.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diesel because it was so thick and so
citrusy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was like Soma's stuff at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like that that whole that
whole era that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_05]: like BPG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the other one I thought
about the other day was Romulan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I would love to wash Romulan right
now and just see what goes.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was I was.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know how I got I was telling somebody
this is how OG was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is how I got Romulan.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was working for Ed and he said,
we're going to a clone exchange.
[SPEAKER_16]: We go to an undisclosed location.
[SPEAKER_16]: A van meets us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are put on blindfolds.
[SPEAKER_16]: We put hoods on.
[SPEAKER_16]: We get in the van and we are driven around
for an hour.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we are we arrive wherever we arrive.
[SPEAKER_16]: We take our boxes, get out.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are led into a house when we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: We got in the house.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we took our hoods.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we're allowed to take our our eye
masks off.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we got high.
[SPEAKER_16]: We showed each other our plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got Romulan.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when we got grapefruit as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: But grapefruit was here with that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was two thousand nine.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, two thousand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'll tell you, I'll tell you the
fact that you got grapefruit and Romulan
[SPEAKER_11]: lends a lot to your story that you got
those simultaneously because and I go way
[SPEAKER_11]: back with Romulan since I I don't know who
Romulan Joe got it from, but I knew
[SPEAKER_11]: Romulan Joe and how I met Romulan Joe was
Hillary hit me up one day and was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: listen, one of the growers, this was at
the club and I was like, how many growers
[SPEAKER_11]: can you possibly have in like six months?
[SPEAKER_11]: She might she might have had three of us
and I was one of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the other one was this dude,
Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know what at the time,
but she was like, can you help out and get
[SPEAKER_11]: this guy back set up?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I invested some money to get his grow
built up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Met him eventually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Giants of a man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Teddy bear of a man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got turned on to that true,
true Romulan.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just like, my God, dude,
we could not get enough of that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's got it.
And.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw Romulan.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw Romulan Joe years later and he just
he was walking with a big jar of weed and
[SPEAKER_11]: he gave it to me and I was like,
what's this?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, oh, it's free.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just use the old grapefruit cut.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I've been I've been growing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the Romulan and the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those have always been my go to.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you said you've got the Romulan
and the grapefruit, that could very well
[SPEAKER_11]: have been from Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have to be if it was the real
deal anyway.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was one.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_16]: I do remember he was here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was 90.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was 90 97.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: I met Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this was 2000 at an undisclosed
location in an area where I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just one of those.
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, actually, it's 99 because I came
in 99.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was actually in 99 because I worked
from Ed from 99 to just before in one.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so then the same thing, once we did
our exchange, we then had to put the mask
[SPEAKER_16]: on, then put the hoods back on.
[SPEAKER_16]: We were led back outside and then driven
back to our undisclosed location,
[SPEAKER_16]: of which we then just all dispersed.
[SPEAKER_16]: So be thankful you can actually go to a
store and actually get your because that
[SPEAKER_11]: shit was nerve wracking, dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to deny.
[SPEAKER_11]: They never he didn't give it away to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know, like that had to have
come like from a very strong source to
[SPEAKER_11]: say, hey, you need to give this to these
people over here like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a few people could have done
that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was by invitation only Ed Rosenthal was
a genetics known guy in Northern
[SPEAKER_16]: California, so it could very well have
been.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't recall.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd have to ask Hillary about that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but it would have to have come from
Romulan Joe if it was the real Rom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the Romulan at BPG was
definitely the real Rom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was great fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know, I was thinking at the end,
I would bet money right now that K from
[SPEAKER_05]: Trichome Technologies was at that
undisclosed location.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was definitely he he has that state.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a funny story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he told it to high times about
like Geraldo Rivera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't he like blindfold Geraldo Rivera or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's just how it was done,
you know, because I didn't want people to
[SPEAKER_16]: remember a location where you were.
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't want a picture of an angle
because people could figure out at night
[SPEAKER_16]: where triangulation of a star was.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you get robbed like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Romulan got lost because of the white
powdery mildew surge of the early odds.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just one of those plants that was
just a fucking magnet for it,
[SPEAKER_16]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it just, you know, that's why it kind
of made its way out.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've yet to find a genetic with that
type of flavor profile that it had.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was there's a there's a cat in
Sacramento right now that has a genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: company called Romulan Genetics and they
and they have some crosses and some other
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been communicating with them,
but I want to see if it's actually if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't I haven't gotten in touch with
them.
[SPEAKER_22]: You could tell if that's the thing about
the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_22]: If we get bold.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone that said they had the Romulan
since Romulan Joe stopped growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just did not have the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_11]: I met one guy on Overgrow that had some
Romulan cross.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, that has Romulan in it
because it's kind of the Romulan is kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of like the Shishkeberry in that sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything you put the Shishkeberry into.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if it was Osamine or what
profile it was, but it just had this.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just always knew that the Shishkeberry
was in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the Nicole from Marimbaro.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the barb from Matt, the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you can taste it in those
cultivars, that Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, yes, shout out to DJ Short that he
was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he was also a big, you know,
just producing fire at that time,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, early 90s, late 90s,
early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, yeah, we were a big part of
those those growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Eugene and that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid 90s, we were definitely I was early
90s, early, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry and Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was huge strains in those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all DJ Short stuff out of
Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also being all put on to tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Soma lived in Eugene before he moved
to Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was kind of crazy stuff
behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know Soos?
[SPEAKER_11]: Soma and Soos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Soma and Soos.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the pair.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the parrot guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had all the birds.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was also in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those guys go way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blue Dream, the Flow and the Blueberry
were all created right around the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a Blueberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually Flow.
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually am a bud of the Flow that I
grew when I was living in L.A.
[SPEAKER_16]: when I moved to L.A.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was working with Todd McCormick there
and I was growing on my own.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was at home and I grew this Flow.
[SPEAKER_16]: I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_16]: I literally brought it into my tattoo
artist and said, I want that here.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the genetic disappeared.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Flow made a great hatch, too.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, he still makes seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a few packs of it, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say that DJ Short's genetics,
you know, really made a stance on Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: Tour any time that those genetics were
brought out on to Shakedown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smell it, you know, before it
even even hit the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was what everybody was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his genetics really spoke volumes
without, you know, having a name attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to it at that time.
So.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like now I look at it and it's it's
crazy because you have different types of
[SPEAKER_07]: breeders now.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like so open that it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like I just love going to the
breeders that aren't hash breeders and
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at those genetics and being like,
I wonder, I wonder how that would be in
[SPEAKER_05]: hash or I wonder this or looking at the
old school stuff and thinking that's
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the most painful thing to do to
yourself is to think of old school
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics and then how good it would have
been in like in like a rosin form or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good way to torture
yourself right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, can you imagine the Romulan and rosin?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that great flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it keeps me up at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why we need a germ original hazes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a germplasm Institute of North
America.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a germplasm Institute of North
America so that all these genetics are
[SPEAKER_16]: saved so that they're kept for posterity,
so that we can't continue to have these
[SPEAKER_16]: stories of lore so that they're actually
protected.
[SPEAKER_16]: So whoever's watching this, get on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need that shit yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be okay for some of my taxes going to
pay for stuff like that in society.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, well, you know,
we pay a certain amount for all the
[SPEAKER_11]: philosophy strains that have been found in
the planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: We pay a certain amount for the things
stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have to be bio remediated that Segre
and others have found out via genetics
[SPEAKER_16]: that they have to pull out.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can't see them, but if you don't
actually clean the genetic out of those
[SPEAKER_16]: bio problems, you're just perpetuating
those issues and inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's, yes, it's just as a step
further.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to get Reggie involved is what
you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to call Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side of that, you know,
also regenerating old strains through
[SPEAKER_00]: really deep soil, multi-diversity,
multi-species, you know, biome is another
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to do it because then you're
just flooding that plant against
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic system and flooding it with
different microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that really also cleans it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the opposite spectrum of,
by utilizing our farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes out of tissue culture,
you got to make an inoculation point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Healthy plant, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Out of retirement gets you to bring skunk
back, Sam.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so yeah, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll wait another few years until people
really appreciate it because why didn't
[SPEAKER_22]: anybody keep a clone?
[SPEAKER_22]: They're dumb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_11]: The skunk one or the fruit one?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause the skunk one, all those people got
busted and they couldn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Skunk one was originally skunky.
[SPEAKER_22]: I bred it sweeter.
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked the sweet version and a better
high flavor and effects to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, you got to remember skunk was
never more than about 17% THC.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was not no ball buster, but people
would consistently pick it over stuff that
[SPEAKER_22]: was 2025 because they liked it better.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I worked for Richard Lee,
who did the bulldog, here in America,
[SPEAKER_16]: I was the guy who worked in his gardens
cause he was in a chair.
[SPEAKER_16]: He loves skunk number one, but he liked
that cut, cut at six and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where he liked it as opposed to
letting it go to eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob liked it a bit earlier than me too,
but I liked it maxed out because I'm a
[SPEAKER_22]: resin producer.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_22]: What was your max for skunk?
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine skunk-y rosin right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember skunk-y rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what all skunk was.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was roadkill in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't Todd McCormick just do a big skunk
number one seed release that he did from
[SPEAKER_01]: like last year?
[SPEAKER_22]: I heard that myth and that rumor.
[SPEAKER_22]: Todd's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that he may be at legends.
[SPEAKER_22]: Todd's a serious smoker.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never seen him smoke a hubbly bubbly
though.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sam, are you going to come to legends?
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I'm not going to come to California.
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, I don't think it's safe to
travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to do the telecast with us
so that we can say hi?
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll consider it.
[SPEAKER_22]: We can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_22]: As soon as we can travel, I'd be glad to
come to California and I'll be glad to go
[SPEAKER_22]: many other places in the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's still a bit iffy to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's just not enough people who are
vaccinated in the world or have had it
[SPEAKER_22]: already.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a definite factor at this point for
sure for travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada just opened up, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Americans go to Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we can yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the ones that have had their jabs
are allowed to come here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we opened actually to all
international travelers recently that have
[SPEAKER_11]: their vaccination, which I get that the
vaccination keeps them from getting really
[SPEAKER_11]: deathly ill or dying doesn't keep them
from getting the virus.
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems strange.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, okay, you can bring the virus
into the country.
[SPEAKER_22]: My brother-in-law was vaccinated twice and
he got the virus.
[SPEAKER_22]: He had already had it.
[SPEAKER_22]: He was vaccinated twice and he got it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in British Columbia- No comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave that alone as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come to British Columbia and for
British Columbians now, some people who do
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in true health and have other ways
of healing themselves will be banned from
[SPEAKER_01]: society.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not be able to go to any
restaurant, no club, no music,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you can't have weddings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public transportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from September 13th till January 30th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be a long time before you see
a good amount of people from British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia because some people need to stay
at their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I suspect it'll end up being like Austria
where they just have these really fast
[SPEAKER_11]: tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't have that jab or
whatever, they'll just get you to do the
[SPEAKER_11]: quick test.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's like, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to be quite like,
we're going to be a segregated apartheid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously the conspiracy freaking me is
always like, Ooh, overbearing powers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Governments are somewhat terrifying.
[SPEAKER_13]: These guys do tend to fuck it up more
often than not.
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_22]: What you want is you want people to wear a
little yellow vaccination star on their
[SPEAKER_22]: shoulder.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, that's what they did in North
Vancouver near where I live.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were giving gold stars away to people
who got two vaccines.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess an elderly woman from like
Poland was in there and she lost it.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was just like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting too, because someone I
spoke to the other day was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this is terrible to make these
correlations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Between like a vaccine passport and the
Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, okay, but like this did
happen and it was in our paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was kind of a connection between
the vaccine passport and you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the Holocaust because the gold star was
the thing that got her.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a gold star.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it wasn't a six-pointed gold star.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a five-pointed gold star,
which of course people in the comments
[SPEAKER_11]: section started having huge arguments
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could imagine from someone,
from the perspective of someone that lived
[SPEAKER_11]: through the Holocaust, that that would
leave a bad taste in their mouth and maybe
[SPEAKER_11]: just do it a different way.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Americans can come to most places
in Europe unless they can prove they've
[SPEAKER_22]: been vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think Canada is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm lucky that I'm happy right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I live in a forest with the
ocean out in France and I got some food
[SPEAKER_11]: growing on my deck.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm feeling pretty good in the area that
I'm in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel pretty healthy too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel that I'm, you know.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but it's fun to travel.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I haven't traveled in a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when I see you, Sam, when I travel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anywhere I go in Europe, boom into
Amsterdam, boom over to Sam's.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I go to Spain, well, shit, he's like,
I'll come to Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get a place.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm used to wearing a mask and just
suck it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been traveling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Marcus, I think that it's really
important, no matter how you feel about
[SPEAKER_00]: the vaccine or not the vaccine,
that we all still need to come together on
[SPEAKER_00]: separatist ideology and separatist rollout
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's incredibly dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people who are showing vaccine
passports to get into a restaurant and
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's okay for them to sit down
and eat food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not okay because there's a lot of
people out there who cannot be vaccinated
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their health and wellbeing of
all different kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't believe in it because of
their religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a true thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've had trauma with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to recognize that there is one
major sort of energy that's bearing down
[SPEAKER_00]: on us right now and joining together is of
utmost importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how you feel about the
vaccine or what your visions are about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot be separating out people like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good for all different
facets of humanity and nor for our future
[SPEAKER_00]: generations and nor for our health and
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never have we been more sick than from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about just sickness of
COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about mental, emotional
illness that people are having with
[SPEAKER_00]: separations of their family because some
people might feel that the vaccine is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are feeling it's not okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When has it ever been that somebody got a
Mac measles vaccine and then another
[SPEAKER_00]: person didn't, but they went to war with
each other and they don't speak with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is happening everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't rise above this, then we lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us lose, vaccinated or not
vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my high horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you all hear this out of
love and out of kindness and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: togetherness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not about separatism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not about a virus
[SPEAKER_00]: or a communing species that we need each
other to be able to have a healthy species
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you need to be able to have
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need dialogue.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_11]: What they did was, you know, a little
while ago, they started to compel speech
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know, they did it here in Canada
where they went through the universities
[SPEAKER_11]: and they were like, Hey, we've now made
some new rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to call people what they want
to be called.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's a bunch of pronouns that come
into play.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was like, there was this dude in
Toronto, a university professor was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, you can't compel speech.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course everyone was like,
Oh, you're against Jordan Peterson.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, you're against the
transgender communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, no, I'm not against the transgender.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're an anti-Semite.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I've actually taught about the
Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd thrown all this shit at this guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And really all he ever stood up for was
the compelment of speech and who see who
[SPEAKER_11]: controls speech, controls what is defined
as hate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a very slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can create, you know, these
discussions that are now one sided
[SPEAKER_11]: because, and I kind of try to remind
people cannabis was one of those things
[SPEAKER_11]: for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: The people in the cannabis world said,
I'll wait till I come back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I back?
[SPEAKER_13]: Elond.
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I back?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_11]: You did one of these.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was saying, I was saying some good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll pull it back out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, yeah, I guess, I guess that's gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: What were you smoking?
[SPEAKER_11]: The last thing I hit was some strong Anna,
one 20 micron full mouth six star.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't expound in strong Anna.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was, you know what I was going to
say?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've removed the dialogue there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like through this Jordan Peterson
conversation of compelling speech.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're controlling what you can and
can't talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's reminiscent of the pot days where
it was prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: Only the gnarly of us were willing to
speak.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all seemed like we were kind of insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: No one really had to listen to us because
we were just crackpots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they've done the same thing for,
you know, get high times.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now they're doing this similar
thing on this other discussion.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, look, okay, I'm not going to
choose a side right now here, but I'll
[SPEAKER_11]: tell you that at least let both sides have
a dialogue because if you make one side so
[SPEAKER_11]: afraid, 90% of people won't be speaking
group anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people who do navigate that group
might come across as, as being a bit off
[SPEAKER_11]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have a better quality and a better
caliber dialogue.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can allow everyone to not have to
feel afraid for their lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to have a discussion about
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where I stand.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, my opinion is it's not that I,
it's not that I don't care about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that there are so many other
things that I care more about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, it's sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a conversation, but it's just a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone tells me that they got the
vaccine or not, I don't think you can need
[SPEAKER_05]: differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more, you know, I'm like,
do whatever the fuck you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never, and that's why I love being a
cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's like, I've always wanted
everyone to feel that way about us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I mean, I like seeing people get
fired up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I also think that
it's like, yeah, we're losing,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're losing a understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that understanding is that like people
should have an opinion, like let them have
[SPEAKER_05]: their opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should ask yourself why you get so
worked up about someone else's fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really should be the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, why do you care so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that it always becomes so
political and it's pretty interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire world is dealing with this,
but yet American politics comes into every
[SPEAKER_00]: single conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I really think we need separating our
own medical freedoms, our own body
[SPEAKER_00]: freedoms from politics people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't about American politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just making you believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's really important that
our own rights and our own medical
[SPEAKER_00]: freedoms and how we look at different
things and the information to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at all sides of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to gain education by
looking at all different facets of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't have all different facets,
then we have a very small conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: going that just goes around in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens when you
politicize anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you politicize things,
that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You politicize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Elect the clown, expect the circus.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all part of that circus,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't elect a reality star as the
president of the United States.
[SPEAKER_14]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying not to talk about politics
right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys went there, so I went there too,
right?
[SPEAKER_16]: I look at it from a health perspective.
[SPEAKER_16]: I take care of patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been dealing with patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole reason Addis and I knew each
other, that got me an upper respiratory
[SPEAKER_16]: infection because there was something I
couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though the traditional market is
still going strong and going stronger than
[SPEAKER_16]: the legal market, it's still not testing
and doing the things that need to be done
[SPEAKER_16]: to protect the consumer.
[SPEAKER_16]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the whole reason we did it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now the overabundance and the
over-regulation has kind of ruined the
[SPEAKER_16]: idea and thought.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I am a medical patient for one.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have Gulf War syndrome.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have my own sensitivity to whatever.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I have employees that I have to
take care of, that we've worked through.
[SPEAKER_16]: We were declared actual people who could
actually go out in the world and serve
[SPEAKER_16]: others.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were also the first one to allow
the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to continue to see people and
take care of people.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I don't believe there's two kinds
of science.
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe there's one science,
which is the replicatable science that
[SPEAKER_16]: anyone could do, which I think Dr. Mark
and of course I would call him Dr. Demora
[SPEAKER_16]: because he,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, it's just one of those things is
that science is replicatable and,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, let's fall upon science.
[SPEAKER_16]: Belief is one thing, but when you cross
over your door and affect and kill people
[SPEAKER_16]: who I know, which I know I just had
multiple friends die in Louisiana because
[SPEAKER_16]: they decided not to get the vaccine and
they had their obituaries.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_16]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the same time, you know,
I'm in favor of vaccines, but I'm not in
[SPEAKER_16]: favor of mandatorily seizing people's
ability to speak or have their choice.
[SPEAKER_16]: But at what point did it cross over and it
affect other people?
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're out and about and going,
because that's the reality is I have
[SPEAKER_16]: enough deaths on my conscience from war.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying not to add any more scalps to
my reality.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to use that terminology.
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't meant in any type of,
of attack of any one shape or form.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a reality of war sometimes.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just the reality that we face.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agree that everybody has their right,
but I also agree with science,
[SPEAKER_16]: but at the same time when we're out as a
society and we're seeing a worldwide
[SPEAKER_16]: situation, you know, we have to realize
that we all have a responsibility to our
[SPEAKER_16]: fellow brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what that is, is your choice to
decide.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I know I've made my choices and
I'm double vax at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add to that, that we all
do have our own choices and we also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility that when we're sick with
the flu or anyone has a cold that you stay
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stay home, but we're not out there,
you know, asking for people's records on
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they have HIV or whether they have
syphilis or whether they have hepatitis A,
[SPEAKER_00]: B or C, because all of those things are
actually contractible in restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think that it's really
important that if we're just going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: separating out this one thing that we need
to really truly have the science and the
[SPEAKER_00]: science is not just hyper focusing on this
one virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about all of it and all of the
contagions that humans are walking around
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to be hyper focusing on one
just really, I'm sorry, it doesn't truly
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense if we're looking at the
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do look at science, we can find
lots of GMO style agricultural,
[SPEAKER_01]: which creates super bugs and super
sicknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no guarantee that everyone's
going to get fully vaccinated and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing is going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: What there is a guarantee is that it's
going to transform and it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: become something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get into mandating
chemicals out of our packaging and garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: going away and enacting health and
wellbeing regimens because the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's not responsible for our
health and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are responsible for our health and
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe instead of spending billions of
dollars on hand sanitizers and masks that
[SPEAKER_00]: really possibly if we are doing the
science, then we're actually recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that that may not be to the best of our
health and wellbeing and actually fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: this virus that we're all dealing with if
we spent billions of dollars on actual
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and actual science that when
people get out into the air and out into
[SPEAKER_00]: nature that they're up taking a healthier
microbiome when we laugh with people when
[SPEAKER_00]: we share a joint in a circle, are we
really truly passing more negativity or
[SPEAKER_00]: are we passing more positivity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really and truly gathering and I hear
everything that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally want to respect what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're saying freedom of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying right on brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I just wanted to speak that there
is science and other facets that we aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for, that we aren't isolating
people out for providing their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: tests at restaurants or in public
gatherings because it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's illogical.
[SPEAKER_16]: But speaking of science, this one goes to
Sam specifically.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just got the IACM bulletin and
apparently they've gone under and are
[SPEAKER_16]: restructuring, which is the International
Association of Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know anything about this or the
restructuring?
[SPEAKER_22]: And how they try to do this online thing,
which I believe they canceled for this
[SPEAKER_22]: October.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think all the weight was on Franjo
and just a few people.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so they're trying to spread it out and
reorganize it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And also they're going to be more of an
umbrella organization for all the national
[SPEAKER_22]: versions of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that clarification.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was cannabis curious.
[SPEAKER_22]: I really like the work they do and Franjo
is a very special friend.
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate what they do and I hope
they're able to continue because they're
[SPEAKER_16]: at the forefront of cannabis research and
getting asked to us cannabiners out here
[SPEAKER_16]: who just want to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're hyper focused on
cannabis because it's a cannabis talk and
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're also so totally entrenched
in cannabis and think it's the best thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the reason why the
endocannabinoid system was even discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: is because there started to be a little
bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, as you know, money started to be
flowing into hemp and cannabis research
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to be able to even find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to open up the conversation
of there's all facets of nature that are
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding within our body that are
communicating within our body that have
[SPEAKER_00]: yet to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the herbal cannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about compounding cannabis,
but we have such a connection with all
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why we're able to get high off of
peyote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why we're able to get high off of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's knowledge of us to understand how
herbal remedies are such a huge factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: our health and well-being all the way down
to repairing our cellular DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well into future generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like what I was saying earlier
about health and optimizing health through
[SPEAKER_05]: biohacking, focusing on gut health,
focusing on these other things so that you
[SPEAKER_05]: can enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I started on focusing on gut health
and understanding that all of this
[SPEAKER_05]: mitochondria is built in the gut and all
your body's made of cells, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: mitochondria driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you figure that shit out and you
start eating correctly to whoever you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just say that because people can
eat, you know, there's food that's served
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But have you ever sat down and kind of
figured out what you eat best?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what's best for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like listen, a lot of people aren't
listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not slowing down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not taking the time to do the
research to figure out what that post
[SPEAKER_05]: really meant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they want to speak about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the, I mean, you would think
that more people would smoke hash because
[SPEAKER_05]: it slows you down and it makes you focus
on little different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like my whole, my whole, everything
I'm doing, my whole mantra and my whole
[SPEAKER_05]: life is hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that exactly cream hash, that
direction, that one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all my business falls into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else falls into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes everything much more simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything outside of that doesn't
attract my attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all, you know, it's like,
that's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're saying that all I gotta do
is just, you know, focus on hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're focusing on is a fractal
medicine that has 10 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck on that becoming so
simplified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Life work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working out incredibly well up to
this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just staying in my lane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just continuing to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm grateful that like how many people
get to do what they really fucking love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think all of us get to do what we
fucking love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Mark loves what he does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark has the fish thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all have this shit in our life that
we get to do because of this, because we
[SPEAKER_05]: understand that like, this is what we
love.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're so blessed for that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so much more.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I started giving weed away when
I did, because I would meet people that
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't in such a good position.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd stoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd stoke them out with weed and they'd
be like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you changed their day and you had
an impact on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, it's just that that's the type
of shit that I think people need to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand that simplify first,
but start with your health and then figure
[SPEAKER_05]: out what you love and run in that
direction and be brave.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what life's about and do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this shit falls into place and be
kind and loving and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and that's the note we're
leaving it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, we, you know, we got into some good
stuff there for a bit, but I was going to
[SPEAKER_09]: crush this out at 12.
[SPEAKER_09]: I let us go 13 minutes over.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my little guy looking at me
through the door, big go eyes wanting to
[SPEAKER_09]: go out electric skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everyone for coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome as always.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been almost a hundred days since we
had a hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see if maybe we can make another
one happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure yet, but I do really
appreciate everyone for coming and sharing
[SPEAKER_09]: their truths.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I can a legends of hash next
month.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about that again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessing.
