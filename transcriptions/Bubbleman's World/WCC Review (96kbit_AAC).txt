[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am over here at the West Coast
concentrate One of the spots with Brett
[SPEAKER_02]: and Adam and today we're going to do a
little review on some West Coast
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate products We were going to film
our melt videos first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get one melt video done in what was
that like an hour?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost broke the pipe twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, drop the light bulb on the table for
additional light Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dropped the silicone or the ceramic as
well as the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll burn the table We decided
we're gonna do the melt videos later And
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just gonna film the talking aspect
we're hitting through a silicone carbide
[SPEAKER_02]: nail and Yeah, why don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull out one of those jars tell us a
little bit about the strength You guys can
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe talk a little bit about what it's
like to wash this particular strain where
[SPEAKER_02]: the melt is found And then we'll all hit
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hit it while you guys are talking
Yeah, so just the one from the top there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the purple candy Which is a pretty
big staple in our flavor department.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, we've run a lot of purple candy
I've never really had it until I moved out
[SPEAKER_01]: to BC a few years ago So for me,
it's it's something similarly new anyways,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the 120 this is one of the first times
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like the bigger heads full
spec is great 73 is great 90 is great But
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I find the bigger heads just
have a bit more flavor They seem to look a
[SPEAKER_01]: little nicer to on the nail in my opinion
anyways, but this stuff is still pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: glandular When 120 is on the flavor is
usually where it holds the best out of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the microns It's proper for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely if you're doing a full
spectrum and the 120 has that flavor Don't
[SPEAKER_02]: be leaving it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still experimenting with different
bags and what's our favorite and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Just what what seems to give more what's
cleaner?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's all it's fun for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we we love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a dream come true really Looks
pretty melty there for sure But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple candy is definitely something
we definitely get to run a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really a blessing It's a it's a
great hash strain at least from from
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that were and what is what is the
cultivars lineage?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is purple candy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't grow this personally this this
exactly I don't grow cannabis personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but so I don't want to you know overstep
I've heard lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that there's purple cushion
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard there's Candy cushion there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that there's the the perps are
in there So it really depends on who you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to cut from big basically what we've
heard from From our friends and from where
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got it from is that it's purple
Christian candy curse is basically what
[SPEAKER_03]: we've heard from You know from my
olfactory in the taste of this rip that I
[SPEAKER_02]: just did That seems pretty on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't say the purse just
Doesn't mean it couldn't be in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't somebody's has the purse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what they've called it That's
the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard these days or everyone's
calling things what they're called and so
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you get the seeds from the guy who
Created the string.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I personally purple candies
One of my favorites for sure from from our
[SPEAKER_01]: our batch of flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yep, definitely Get out there
that last little bit of a little scoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get that little We have to be
quick on the on the how you drop it into
[SPEAKER_02]: the nail That's for sure here ninja down
to see you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when people leave a little bit
of Drink on the can take your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, take your friends, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was really Nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the potency of the purple candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a joy to photograph It's a pleasure
whether it's in rosin or bubble hash the
[SPEAKER_02]: microns the full spectrum It's hard for me
to say if I have a favorite of the microns
[SPEAKER_02]: or the full spectrum I really just like it
all when I grab my jars and I see the name
[SPEAKER_02]: on it I'm usually pretty happy to know
that I'm gonna be able to get a great dab
[SPEAKER_02]: out of this out of this hash
[SPEAKER_03]: Something we get to watch all the time
that was so quiet it didn't land because
[SPEAKER_02]: it landed on the cute But it seemed like
it landed on this even they may have yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuz I know it was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was expecting it to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very old jar This is a marble
slinger classic probably 2002 maybe 2003
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want to be losing that fella So
yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one flavor down purple candy 120
micron from the West Coast concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: crew Let's move on shall we next I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this og 73 It was really one of the
first things we've come across where we
[SPEAKER_03]: pulled it right out of the bag and do
instantly There was no way we could see it
[SPEAKER_03]: with the the room and temperature that we
had so we instantly had to freeze it go to
[SPEAKER_03]: micro Go to micro planning and it turned
out really nice micro planning was always
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like a safety net for me Yeah,
you know when people ask me what I liked
[SPEAKER_02]: to do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, they're both in my
quiver Yeah, and sieving is what I prefer
[SPEAKER_02]: and micro planning can get me out of a jam
that's when my hash is just Greased right
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it turned out really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Look forward to running more of it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah 73 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've kept the 90 in there as well as
the 120 So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely It's a new flavor for us to
be running and we're definitely stoked on
[SPEAKER_01]: Just any new flavors really but this one
seemed to be a really great hash train
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to go bad Hard to go wrong with with
great flavors for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Jesus table, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to it's hard to deny
the og.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful
hand-pressed full Like five to six star
[SPEAKER_02]: quality for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oh, I think actually you started us off
last time didn't you sure I can definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: do it go this time or maybe you ended us
off Sorry, that's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ended us off Bubbling right up big
clear domes real nice color on it and You
[SPEAKER_03]: know that classic Oh flavor and taste Oh
Nice from like what I know in my head of
[SPEAKER_03]: OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly that Beautiful yeah want to
give it a little zamboni there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't It was a little bit bigger than I
usually give you a You know why cuz it was
[SPEAKER_02]: my rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I need to give this to Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna push this on of this guy I'm
gonna push This on to this guy just the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash pusher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna lie a bit of a pusher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee Kush 73 my true 73 that means the
90 micron bag was not used and Everything
[SPEAKER_02]: from below the 120 bag fell into the 73
bag the true the real deal Shaquille O
[SPEAKER_01]: 'Neal the RDSO Yeah, I was uh,
I was super surprised that Just how nice
[SPEAKER_01]: it came out Not that it was, you know ugly

[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a new thing for us to do and
we're still I Take it deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I see that Very lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very just you know classic Oh gee Kush

[SPEAKER_02]: tear up right now, but I can it's so close
And that's that's kind of what you look

when you're building your quiver Of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, you want something like oh gee
Kush in there that's gonna really Give you
[SPEAKER_02]: a punch taste great melt like a five or
six star I'm just kind of not ever really

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah presses out beautiful Looks nice and
blonde all the way through right to dry.
Yep
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you dipped the wrong end

[SPEAKER_03]: photography one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an it's a never-ending out Good
call good call, even though I'm already
[SPEAKER_02]: cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my new q-tip tack of cleaning the
nice little Nice big ice one, please.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just take it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, geez It's a nice it We're just gonna
give a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a good one bread always asked
for a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Let's give him a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be about six hits It's a
quarter of the gram But It's the OJ who
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't love the OJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my god, it's just beautiful
Somebody in church was telling a story
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gee somebody call it the og Yeah,
yeah exactly the and then he had to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it out dog Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love stories like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, this is a good rip That's what
you get if you dip your dabber in my jar
[SPEAKER_02]: and you break a big chunk of hash off
smoke at all you get to smoke it Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: not a bad thing I don't if you want that I
definitely don't mind you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's It would have been a nice milk video
this one because it was You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: generally we don't want to waste hash when
we're making a melt video a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: think I waste my hash I'm smoking that
hash while I'm making the melt video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an easy thing to do It's not
especially once you do two or three in a
[SPEAKER_02]: row and you know a size hit like that You
smoke a gram in 15 minutes and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Champion hit from Brett right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that was great top-notch action
there and Now we get to move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the last one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one is from our good friend Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah true genetics true genetics He's got
the sweat band.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the sweat band true 73 as well
Phil processed and grew this photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks beautiful It's definitely really
nice super unique smell all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: hashes really look beautiful I have to
make a picture where they're all ready
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to one another to show their subtle
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems to be potentially it's a little
cheesier funky smelling Yeah, but still
[SPEAKER_01]: like a strong cushy kind of nice blondish
yellow look to it sparkles nicely as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: too That one did not get microplanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got all the heads still intact
nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got some photos So you guys are
probably looking at them right now
[SPEAKER_02]: overlaid on the video beautiful beautiful
stuff Yeah, Phil did a great job on that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely got to give him a props room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett just did a great job on that rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are definitely going to Nat's pizza
Okay, here's something that we got to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: the people is Nat's originally like from
Brooklyn or Manhattan because this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: place is done up Like it's a New York
pizzeria What I'm asking people is is
[SPEAKER_02]: there Nat's pizza in Manhattan or in New
York City?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know we'll bring you there after we
do this review, maybe we'll show you Nat's
[SPEAKER_02]: real quick and Smiling Brett eating a big
piece of pizza Some margarita pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, my favorite So what do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got OG we're finished with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are due for a sweat band You too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit this already?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not touched yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will know too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he hit it It was the most impressive
hit I've ever taken out of a jar from a
[SPEAKER_02]: photographer standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell where he hit it from Of
course This is my waking bake here,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to not know what's going on
even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go You've already had two hits
haven't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Third one more than two hits because we
were doing that the trying to get the melt
[SPEAKER_02]: hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what was happening with the melt
hits to give You the side story is my
[SPEAKER_02]: flash ring that sits on the front of the
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's broken on the inside It has three
clips and one of the clips on the inside
[SPEAKER_02]: no longer pushes out to hold it on the
lens So it falls off and it falls on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of delicate things like bongs and hash,
you know powdered out hashes It's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I know we're getting stoned but
This is a fun part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about the headband or the
sweatband.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely is true to its name First of
all, he took the headband and he crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: it with what to make the sweatband.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we got We'll get him to put it
in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil will tell us what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave this to me and I should know and
it was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely one of those rips that
everyone at the cannabis cup wants to give
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's a big rip as long as
it's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give me something that's not clean
and I have to take too much of it Then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sweatband is pretty cheesy
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like cheese, but it's funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the Hindu comes out a little bit
cheese-esque as well and I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer that flavor honestly over a lot
of the fruity ones myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: To each their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit cheesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the cheese, but it's
definitely got some some funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you for the size of the rip I
took that's a lot of smoke that it
[SPEAKER_02]: produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually hit really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to Phil for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't really want to hit half the
jar again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when you pull it out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't even really have to hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought I know you love big rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not like I was being a
dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like he loves big rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: He on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I give you a big rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was a bit big.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't die.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes the puss turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The puss turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about those in Hash Church for
those of you that watch Hash Church every
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday morning on Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gets so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have a Hash episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have these guys on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna invite a bunch of other
different people that are actively making
[SPEAKER_02]: hash on the regular and just have a great
episode about talking about hash and
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about little tips and tricks and
different subtleties and nuances that we
[SPEAKER_02]: all find and see when we're making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was three bubble hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did want to finish it off with a rosin
rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about the rosin that we're hitting
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some Master Scout rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one of my favorite
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in our quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super, super lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it up to the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hold your hand in the back there and
it'll clear right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go close, close, close and it'll
grab once everything else disappears
[SPEAKER_02]: probably right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's definitely a very nice
looking rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty lemony on the flavor but it's like
a lemon soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be my favorite type of rosin that
you guys make.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that Jack Frost Master Scout
combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes so well with almost any of the
turps that we've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it better with the Hindu on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple Hindu?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Blue River for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the hash rosin can get a little
bit buttered out or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the hash hasn't been fully,
fully dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just little things like that can change
the way that the hash comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one stayed really stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, this one's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like lemon pledge or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a cleaning supply for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very pledgey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pledgy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a great, I mean I took a very
small one but it's got a great kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: feel to the high too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very upbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying though, I don't even mind
smoking that before bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the master.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gets me into a nice place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a good functioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be very nice after this OG rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the shadow of the tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, did I give him that little
dirt on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he looked at it,
it kind of made me doubt myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think I might be giving it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alas, I did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, real nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the master scout rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can they get these products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these products are available
either at Eden Medicinal Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have multiple locations where you can
also find some of our products at THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on Main Street in Vancouver.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can check you guys out as
well on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have accounts on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast Melts and West Coast
Connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also follow The West Coast
Collective with no E on the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And True Genetics 604 for some of the
genetics and pictures of hash and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean aside from giving the JMAX
and a shout out for starting a great
[SPEAKER_02]: company and seeing, having the wisdom to
create a branch of solventless crew that
[SPEAKER_02]: are actively making water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tough gig in our city right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Butane is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unflushed, can be grown weed is all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to find top quality,
properly grown cultivars that have then
[SPEAKER_02]: been processed into properly processed and
dried and cured resins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hats off to both of you guys for doing
the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the inspiration as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course to you and all of the big guys
out there that are just doing it right and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we came.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw it and we were like, how do we do
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally for the very reason that we want
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a win, win, win when you see
the younger generation coming up and they
[SPEAKER_02]: have beautiful hash and rosins and you're
like, I've been waiting for this to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not go hang out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wondered when I, when it was me
15 to 17 years ago in Vancouver and no one
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I wonder how long this will
take to get everyone doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like 20 years later and it's
still, you guys are like, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, we're waiting for,
you know, it's a tough gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tough gig for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016 is the year of the full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we're going to see what
Johnny B coined as the death of BHO,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she surely has been wounded boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is only here to do it's purpose of
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is only here to do it's purpose of
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles and hours.
