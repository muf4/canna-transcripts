[SPEAKER_06]: Who's here, buddy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy smokers in the house?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I've been hanging out with you
on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you're hanging out with me right now
on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buddy's saying hi?
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, time for one of these.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many times did we leave this on the
front?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, you burnt the butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put the butter on and it burnt the
last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was last night and today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last night you did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't cook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shar, here's this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why we don't eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs your bad, Shar.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we don't eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs your bad, Shar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted hash browns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I left to go get you and to go
get the bubble machine out of the shop and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else and get it all ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had the Omegon on six, ready to put
the plate on for the hash browns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to help him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I walked away and I burned the
butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now round three.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want the hash browns so much?
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like something I might want.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hash browns are finally making the
pat there, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we're photographing dry sift resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing some macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our dirty, our one time cleaned
and our pure headies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just small amounts, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lesson is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the whole process was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that difference in color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can really go in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to learn from this to lower
buds not supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing the bigger plants and having the
buds lower in the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit of contaminant in there,
but for the most part, pretty darn heady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron was just saying how glad he was that
the camera wasn't on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that Ron?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm so stoned that I was sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember the last little episode
they ever taught about how to rebirth the
[SPEAKER_03]: butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got to go and I left the omegon
and went and picked up Paul that way down
[SPEAKER_03]: the road and gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I come back and hear him talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a hoot?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I come back and I'm talking to
you guys and I'm thinking I'm stirring and
[SPEAKER_03]: heating it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking so Mark can keep on doing what
he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the omegon is not on.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we do here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try some of this,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanted Paul to give a little taste
test?
[SPEAKER_06]: The colors are really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smell how the smell smells too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can look good and they're total tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beautiful thing is, is when you
have big large, you can only get good tops
[SPEAKER_03]: from bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that it's unless you got a
hell of a breed, but for purple Kush and
[SPEAKER_03]: see the purple, they purple up nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the girls trim these, of course,
when there are buds for us, these are bone
[SPEAKER_03]: dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the girls trim these,
they would sit there and I'd say,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, put a little extra into that and
trim in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to make it look like a cactus in
the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people can have this buds for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we put a little extra care into
trying to make them all so they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: this little nugget stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I found purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ends up like this here because it's
such a tight growing plant that's so dense
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can't leave that as a bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then they all end up being smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you end up getting a lot of this
stuff, which are still nuggets.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should all grow nuggets if we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When someone hits the floor, it should
have a clunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tossing his knives around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a nicer one though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, uh, that's probably okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just, because everybody always
wonders about weight, because everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: always wonders about weight and things
when they see they all, that's not a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: of power.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put that nugget on the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is, uh, try, try using that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your, uh, airtight container.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the airtight watertight maintainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can break your cannabis up.
[SPEAKER_06]: With it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pull the second one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the lid off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now pull the top one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at that.
Sneaky.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw some kind of grinder on a,
on a, like a credit card.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a, where are they?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I don't get to the big city
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what you can have one.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that work as a grinder?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully like a, like a, it's a little
grader.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite, uh, Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your credit card.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean now you're a business card.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice graphic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just rub the butt on that.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Six grand butt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Six grand butt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Six grand.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost a quarter ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the dance too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way it can be to be safe,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to put in, you know,
met maintainers should next think about
[SPEAKER_03]: getting, getting us people really high
quality, uh, contain bigger containers so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can have, uh, so we can be
confident that there's that, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: that what we put our, I have to use a new
bin every time between I have storages of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, material.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cause I just don't want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I just don't know what's going on,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of just having a screen
right on the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wouldn't that be neat?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could just, I should make it all
without cheating it, without cheating and
[SPEAKER_03]: rubbing it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: People roll it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I heard that and I go, Oh, no,
that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a grower, how about a liner?
[SPEAKER_03]: We want like, like just, just my
association with Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know, I realized I grow all that
material only for the glance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trichome farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so, uh, so it's so important to
keep the glance on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have our turpines, our colors,
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the, I'd be proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you over, over just purple
crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to call purple Christian,
but darn it's just, but darn darn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you tried any of the pure?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Jordan is rolled.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys going to like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul's going to smoke her down and
we're going to see Paul how he is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're smoking down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's no popper for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul's a popper.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Holy smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said no to the toke once in 1978.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: I still regret it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a true story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will smoke a bowl with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always feel bad, but when you first got
your volcano and we started Holy smoke and
[SPEAKER_07]: he said, so what are you still burning
your way?
[SPEAKER_07]: You might as well throw in the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want the video to end up burning
the hash browns.
[SPEAKER_07]: We burned like three or four pizzas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we kept sitting down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I slept for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I flushed for three minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet so badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be gray and burn nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that joint should not go out and we
put in the after it's burning nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes on smooth like velvet too on the
throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it taste nice too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it doesn't look good, but it's also
got to be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoken like a true grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sense of taste isn't what it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's working my world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what your whole house used to smell
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whoever you are or whoever's got skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, they're true old fat leaf
bagel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard bikers had it bred out.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of biker weed that they
didn't buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody had control breeding
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have lost it because we were all
afraid of getting busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we didn't have can filters back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people wouldn't buy it if it was
too stinky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the sixties or the late sixties,
early seventies, probably 75 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have one big skunk plant in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, one thousand watt light, good air,
good air in and out as much as we could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that plant stunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: One plant, one one thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the old days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you got made it by, you made it by.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wouldn't believe how many times
the neighbors would always say,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I don't care what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, filters came in and
bigger roofs came in and all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we lost it because everybody was
against that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to kill us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smell would kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we want it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause now we can honestly be proud of that
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walk down the street and smell that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go, Hey, that guy's grown some
dank.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're at, we're at a half of the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well grows right by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the grower and I feel hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard when, when Mark's here with me,
because when you're smoking dry sift,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're smoking bubble of the highest
qualities in the world, and then you have
[SPEAKER_03]: your high, the best I could grow it in pot
world, you know, like stuff to try and how
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, it's just so hard for pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking pot to measure up, to go at the
same, it shouldn't be a contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this is about a, this is,
but it's hard anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel inferior when I have a pot that
we can make bubble out of when I got,
[SPEAKER_03]: when it's compared to dry sift and bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm humbled by bubble and, and,
and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have my humility Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried to grow the best, but,
and I hope it passes our standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for the one plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would compare it to something like say
moonshine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can make moonshine out of your
wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take your nice good wine,
make it into grappa.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the grappa is way stronger.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll kick your ass, but there's something
to that wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's got its subtle overtones
and it's tastes in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the bud has, you know,
yeah, you can, you can extract it,
[SPEAKER_07]: make it way stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So holy smoke, what do you give it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, is it, does it deserve to be holy
smoke?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, yeah, this is triple A quadruple A
maybe even the way it's trend and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so hard to guess that you feel
the inferior when you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: A dab of a fancy, fancy bubbling product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, and that's the first thing you
wake up to is, but you know, the crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were saying on the way to the ride when
I picked you up, but the problem is that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not available to everybody in the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still like good old low tech,
although I gotta say like I love smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love, so this is the first joint I've
smoked in a long time, but I bake 99% of
[SPEAKER_07]: the time and it gets me higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a way more efficient use of weed,
but I miss smoking every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll smoke the joint just to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the taste of this refried,
because I find, because remember that I
[SPEAKER_03]: also got scared that this is a,
this is the first batch of refried ever
[SPEAKER_03]: taken down where I didn't have plates and
plates of finger hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my finger hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I, when that happens,
boy, I get scared because like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Mark does teach me some things
that maybe sometimes the plots that went
[SPEAKER_03]: through, uh, through crisis or,
or through a little more stress while
[SPEAKER_03]: there, well, there wasn't purpose,
but perfect, you know, they sometimes make
[SPEAKER_03]: also a good bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That not correct, Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a, but, uh, but anyways,
uh, but I want to go back to growing some
[SPEAKER_03]: product that's, that's really admired by
myself before the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a grower, I, I want anything that
just, that just, you know, just average.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to find that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I, if we get to keep growing for a
while, I want to find that plant or go
[SPEAKER_03]: grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The god plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm growing the god plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never lost the race because he never
had to have competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every, every race ran and he was too old
for anybody to buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're dabbing it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this dabbing it the right way when you
dab it with?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: With full melt as opposed to some kind of
oil that are made in very I think it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little carb on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the, how does it taste on that
hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I keep saying, my sense of taste
isn't so good because I have no story
[SPEAKER_07]: about a science infection years ago and
never quite recovered, but I can taste it
[SPEAKER_07]: with my brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's what we like to hear.
[SPEAKER_07]: It rocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened, Ron?
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, we didn't plan this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not for to make bubble bubble
world like, uh, like Wayne's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, like, uh, this, uh, I swear we did not
plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Paul here talking old stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We burned it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny now that you, that you mentioned it,
it's really smoking here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We burned the hash Browns, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We burned the hash as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can stop that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right there, Ron, would you like to
increase your davitude?
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have one just so I can get wreck
rock and roll ready for work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron's going to increase his davitude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great little carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that feeling?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess week 60 gold lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your knee pads on for working in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do kids know what that means?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where that came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So
[SPEAKER_00]: here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just had a great day hanging out with
Paul D from the Holy smokes and he's off
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's taking off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we'll see you again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I fall over on the bud, as I trip over,
I just about broke my neck on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaving this lying around, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
