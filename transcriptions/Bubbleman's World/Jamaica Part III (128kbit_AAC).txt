[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd like to see the frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, tomorrow I definitely could build a
beach house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean, tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it rains, we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got back to Ashley's place here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great double is tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nomads threw it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys saw, they were very
talented guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Neil was busting it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shep, Evy, Bird Eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Yardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just making some really nice dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we held it down in the
chalice station and mostly got chaliced up
[SPEAKER_00]: all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting the tourists, of course,
as well as some of the steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we figured we'd finish it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of figured that this was a Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashley just asked me, hey, have you filmed
a Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I think we might be
filming it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Puff Wednesday, coming at you live
from Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of last rips for the night before
we call it a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a nice little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one right on the dabber right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice thing about these pipes is
there's literally no turnaround of time
[SPEAKER_00]: between my dab and your dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be gone in about three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn fine rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, I'm gonna hit myself one
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I can show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dropped off some bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll show you tomorrow in the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Kwan Yin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Rip Rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rip Rack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rip Rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing a Sour Cross with Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a Grand Daddy Perps up on top
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll be trying these out later,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get the microscope out and
photograph them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also hoping on making some
bubble with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, not obviously these single little
buds, but with some serious amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what we could do with each of
these is we could do the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rossum technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony's gonna be bringing the hair
straightener and the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maybe we'll get a couple of dabs out
of each of these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the returns are,
but I suspect there must be a dab or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or two in each bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really liking this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see because we have the overhead
fan on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA element is almost just
consistently orange hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't leave it on too long when we
have it under the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want one more little one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll take one more for Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really one more for all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call it a day at the end of this
Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about?
[SPEAKER_00]: One o'clock in the morning?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a long day tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be setting up our booth at
the nutraceutical conference that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening near the zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently Ash has been there and it's a
pretty killer venue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see the Prime Minister will be
speaking, Portia Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess some other people in the
industry from different aspects will be
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to be sitting at the booth
with CRD and with sunspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be doing spice seasonings and
I'll mostly be promoting the processing
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities that you can CRD will be able to
offer smaller companies like our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Maurice's with the infusement of some of
their spices or some of their products
[SPEAKER_00]: with phytocannabinoids, which of course I
specialize in decontaminating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that all comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more Dunkarooski.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little dabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will bid you good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we'll see you guys tomorrow
for all sorts of more fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash is so sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, come off my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one.
Right?
We'll see you guys next time on Bubble
Man's World.
Peace out from Kingston.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you you
