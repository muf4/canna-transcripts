[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was a really interesting
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so our audience knows, because I'm
not sure everybody is tuned in on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them what EC is and why it's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so EC is the electrical
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the measure that reflects the amount
or the concentration of nutrients in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample or at the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending how you're reading it,
from which sample you're starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the EC is, in simple words,
is just the concentration of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: you're giving to the plant or at the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has a direct impact on the
osmotic pressure at the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the osmotic pressure has a direct
correlation with water absorbance and
[SPEAKER_00]: water movement within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, obviously, a direct impact on the
growth, on the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other point, as I mentioned
earlier, is with our goal to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress to obtain more cannabinoids
and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes with some secondary effects,
like the huge drybacks we are aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They result in higher ECs, which means
salts building within the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we have to use balanced
recipes and make sure that all what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering to the plant is uptaken and not
just building within the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, as a chemist and,
you know, as a scientist, I love this
[SPEAKER_01]: connection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because certainly, like, if you think
about electrical conductivity in plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: in soil, what the hell, you know,
that's like some electrical measurement
[SPEAKER_01]: that you should be making on a phone or a
device or something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily compute with some
people on why electrical conductivity is
[SPEAKER_01]: important in living systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you explained it beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we do have these at the
beginning where we just started,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were using the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with some probes, we do the EC
readings in the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Marcus mentioned, sometimes we have
these high values of EC in the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end, we started using some
probes to read the EC within the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there is a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reference of using the,
in rock wall, I know in soil with the pull
[SPEAKER_00]: through method, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soil, you should look at the runoff,
in cocoa as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in rock wall, I think it's better to
make, it's more accurate to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: readings at the root zone to make better
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not specific for any one salt,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just basically gives you an overall
level of how much ionic material you have
[SPEAKER_01]: down there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not specific for like a nitrate or
a sulfate or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the EC will give you just how spicy you
are in your recipe at the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the leaf analysis that we give
you in details, how much nitrogen you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, how much calcium, magnesium,
and it's in there.
