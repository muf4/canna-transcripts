[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome back to the
Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we took a break for a little while,
but we're gonna be coming back strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quick though, Dr. Allen is going to
share with us today one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important discoveries in human history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Allen, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discovery of the endocannabinoid
signaling system is the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery in human history and will save
more lives than the discovery and
[SPEAKER_00]: application of sterile surgical technique
and the realization of germ theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a heart surgeon saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shout out to Ignaz Semmelweis,
the Hungarian physician who drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the incident of perforal fever by the
use of hand disinfection in obstetrical
[SPEAKER_01]: clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to what Dr. Allen just said,
he's putting it above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have more really soon,
so stay tuned for more Cannabis Journal
[SPEAKER_01]: Club with Dr. David Allen and me,
the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, everybody.
See you next week.
Thank you.
