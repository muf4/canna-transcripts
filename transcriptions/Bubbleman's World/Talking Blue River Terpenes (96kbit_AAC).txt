[SPEAKER_00]: few things I'm praying that this is going

[SPEAKER_00]: hope we're gonna have a good one today I
think it's time to discuss terpenes got a
[SPEAKER_00]: big order in for Blue River Canada and one
of the strains we got in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars is called Karma's bitch
Neville's haze crossed with an RD one
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the rare dankness one clone or a
cut that Scott created a bunch of his seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line with so we've got the Karma's bitch
that's gonna be going up on Blue River dot
[SPEAKER_00]: CA as well as some other special things a
full a full little five mls of gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: glue and we got what else do we got over
here we got oh there's a special one OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush who doesn't love OG Kush I mean come
on so these are all gonna be up at Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: River oh this one special black lime
reserve unbelievable flavor profile on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one here really stoked to have it in
the selection what else we got oh here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: new one mojito yeah mojito so apparently
the mojito with some indoor grown really
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful what do I got block cleaner and
oh that's a new one orange cookies two
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars mixed into one when aren't you
talking about terpenes well you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: just just got a whole fresh batch of
terpenes in so obviously I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about them let me see what else we
got grape ghost and block cleaner which we
[SPEAKER_00]: already had up on the site so those are
nothing new but here's something new sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel cultivated in Jamaica sun-grown
tropical terpenes the first of their kind
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to you via Blue River and I've got
two nice five ml vials of sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great and we also have a couple
of new cultivars which is the crown royal
[SPEAKER_00]: also grown and cultivated in Jamaica as
well as the white cookies so the white
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies the sour diesel and the crown
royal all freshly produced in Jamaica and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I got a little blue dream I got a
nice little a vial of blue dream as well
[SPEAKER_00]: so all sorts of different terpenes I've
been talking to the cannabis culture guys
[SPEAKER_00]: actually I see all he is texting me right
now over there on Beattie Street if you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are around and want to support
cannabis culture they have been sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the longest-acting activists in the city
and now they have a dispensary I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: on getting them some Blue River terpenes
I've also been talking to the Sunrise
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellness Center Max and Dom they're going
to be carrying these terpenes and on
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver Island you can check them out at
Leaf Compassion one of the five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: stores that Kyle has there he's been
absolutely killing it and in the meantime
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's gonna be time to do some terp
dipping because we can show terpenes but
[SPEAKER_00]: we certainly better be enjoying terpenes
as well you guys can't really see
[SPEAKER_00]: off-camera but I've turned my Pelican case
into a terp case what better way to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: your and secure your terpenes and jamming
them into that Pelican case of course for
[SPEAKER_00]: my little mini personals I've got these
ones which is a wonderful way to carry
[SPEAKER_00]: around a variety of terpenes I think it
fits like eight eight little packages so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see right there nicely fitting
close it up keep it upright in the pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the idea of the terpenes tipping
and spilling over even though we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper lids here at Blue River you're
not going to get any plastic degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a special PTFE plastic that
doesn't degrade by via hydrocarbon or
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene so hey welcome Robert W.E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laurie to the room and Tyler Subsect and
Michael Manas bubble man can you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: video when your rosin press again and do
some flower rosin I will do that for you
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time I get some really beautiful
hello Jen Bennett as well the next time I
[SPEAKER_00]: get some really lovely flowers I will do a
little video Ramo is going to do a video
[SPEAKER_00]: with me in the near future with these
flavors we're gonna go do a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: gauntlet with him on Terpene Tuesday on
his channel and I suspect while I'm there
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll acquire a little handful of each of
the nuggets that he has and I'll do a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: press for you guys in the meantime I've
got some lovely hand-mixed West Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate always best to show you their
logo because fuck do these guys ever do it
[SPEAKER_00]: right serious boys right there really
happy to have them in my life no doubt
[SPEAKER_00]: about it also got some of this dragon
breath rosin from them and then of course
[SPEAKER_00]: a selection of okay let me see we got we
got this crazy Congo shatter and then
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath that we've got some cookies
butter on a different little spot and then
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorites which I've been
keeping in here this stuff is like red
[SPEAKER_00]: glass this is 73 micron Congolese rosin
made from bubble hash and every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: open it people are just like what the fuck
is that so there you go let me see if I
[SPEAKER_00]: just tilt this over a little bit so you
guys get a better oh I'm smashing things
[SPEAKER_00]: there we go how's that little quality
action right there yeah Jen no doubt who
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't let's have a bong rep or let us
get medicated whichever way you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide I'm going to grab a little of this
dragon's breath dip it into a little of
[SPEAKER_00]: this bubble hash and then I'm going to
have a nice little dip in some Kovella
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel so you can see we got a nice
little if I can get that in there without
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping it booyah oh yeah that's a dip
right there that my friend is a dip right
[SPEAKER_00]: there um I dab a fair amount of rosin but
I love me some bubble hash there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt about it yes they are Calum they're
going to be available in both America and
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada you know one of my big parts of
bringing Blue River up to Canada was
[SPEAKER_00]: because Canadians couldn't access this
product we were supposed to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media watch the hash churches watch
Tony and all these guys have these amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar flavors and we weren't to have
them well I just wasn't having it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I started Blue River Canada and
have been making it my mission to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: these terpenes up to Canada for you guys
all to be able to have and we are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that most people are not doing
we're using very very high grade cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in greenhouses or organically or out
on the fields in Jamaica to produce these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes these are not cold trapped butane
slab terpenes these are not trim run
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes these are about as high level of
terpene extraction that you can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is going to make it into Canada soon
Steven I know that you can has been
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing with Theracan in a way for them
to potentially bring the technology up
[SPEAKER_00]: here and be able to start brokering Prana
into different LPs I would love to also
[SPEAKER_00]: see dispensaries being able to carry it as
well that's what I'm saying all right
[SPEAKER_00]: let's have a dip here Ross Kaplan in the
house that's right brother Jamaican Turk
[SPEAKER_00]: party right on here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: well it's all that kissing the cod Chris
too much drinking and kissing cods you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a tough job worked out for you brother
Newfoundland I've never been I can only
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine that it's an amazing place ie the
Rock East Coast of Canada there's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's you've got a lot of history to
work through hey Benjamin nice to see you
[SPEAKER_00]: I will break out the Swiss next time I do
a chat I'll have the Swiss perk I got my
[SPEAKER_00]: straight fab close by but you're right the
Swiss perk should be representing who love
[SPEAKER_00]: me some Dizzle
[SPEAKER_00]: man I'll tell you one thing about turp
dipping is you can't believe how much more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hit you actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice gen Bennett and greetings Jeffrey
from Flint Michigan USA I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what everyone is puffing on and
simultaneously I would love to know where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone is puffing in so I want to see
this the cultivar that you're hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's flour hash or rot or oil and
what city you're currently residing in
[SPEAKER_00]: while you watch this little bubble man
live feed
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I love using these this is a little
trick that I started doing I realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: these little jars that the West Coast
concentrate guys make our perfect fit on
[SPEAKER_00]: this on the halo dish and so what I've
noticed is if there is any residue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar it heats up from the heat of the of
the nail and it slowly melts down you get
[SPEAKER_00]: these little ninja rips where you're you
know you're dabbing out and you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to carve your hit but you're getting more
of a hit because it's dripping off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar so that's what's constantly happening
here with me
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah that's delicious absolutely
delicious well hopefully I will be heading
[SPEAKER_00]: down to these shops in the near future to
go see Ollie at the CCH Q and to go see
[SPEAKER_00]: that Max and Dom at the the Sunrise
Wellness Center and more people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver will have access to being able
to go and walk right into these shops and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase it's nice to be able to smell
what you're about to purchase and for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you that are in other places of
Canada by all means contact me and get in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with me via BlueRiverExtracts.ca if
you want to hit yourself some flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meantime why don't we have one last
little dab to send you all on your way I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking cookies rosin that's what I'm
thinking I'm thinking cookies rosin and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking orange creamsicle orange
creamsicle and and and the cookies it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and that that's why Tony did the the
orange cookies actually which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: creamy creamy creamsicle cultivar mixed
with a cookies one as well I got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people sending me messages while I'm doing
this it's hilarious Kyle join the live
[SPEAKER_00]: feed brother I'm having a hard time
reading your messages and the messages
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming in Kyle from Leaf
Compassions hitting me up right now he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got some interesting news as always he's a
frontline cannabis warrior open up shops
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than most people shop for socks I
fucking love it and let's do this last dab
[SPEAKER_00]: shall we
[SPEAKER_00]: well that one got me not gonna lie that
was absolutely stupendous it's a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with the terpenes you never really
know how they're going to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: different flavors obviously those
cultivars that you're hitting whether in
[SPEAKER_00]: hash or oil have a terpene profile of
their own and therefore they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwine and mix with the terpene
profile that you've added on and I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely prefer it much much much much
more than adding terpenes to a flavorless
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate all
[SPEAKER_00]: right good to keep the halo clean if you
know what I mean a little bit of q-tip
[SPEAKER_00]: tech on that will keep things nice and
fresh in the meantime I have to go but I
[SPEAKER_00]: do appreciate all of you guys and girls
coming and hanging out and enjoying a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a session here with me I
will try and make it on later today and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do this again in the meantime may
the full melt bless your bowl sooner than
[SPEAKER_00]: later peace out everybody
