[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just walking the streets of Vancouver
here, trying not to get hit by bikes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am out in front of Burb,
one of the local dispensaries here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver, owned by a really cool dude,
John K.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the founders anyway, and he's got a
space upstairs that we do book club in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called Book Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a weekly gathering where we
promote our different products,
[SPEAKER_00]: get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a vapor lounge vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's live music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's DJs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of couches and chairs
set up that are really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of companies come and offer free
samples from gummies to drinks to dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a brand new piece from the
good folks at Mothership, one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: prototype pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be going up today and
running the dab bar for a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving some dabs of some Dragonfly Earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might as well get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding it together here, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, I saw the prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fired about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm on some sort of list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adolfo said I'm on the freebie list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to check?
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just up there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bumped into this young fellow,
fellow hash aficionado, taking us up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Burby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we've got a session going on
over here and another session going on
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to do a little footage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can barely see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adolfo's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get in behind this dab bar
and set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the matter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an urgent pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you put your sticker on the fridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I pull this pipe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please notice the extra air movement
in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we installed more fans,
and then more fans, and then more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I guess I've grabbed the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try not to fuck it up, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl, I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prototype mothership pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is going to hit like a
champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be a good night
tonight, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: 110 for an ounce, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste it, taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, when did you get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it like two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go with the electric nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to break it in right
now.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to set up the camera here,
and then we're going to get right back in
[SPEAKER_00]: to hitting this beautiful pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting ready here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well listen, this is the break-in hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like strawberry guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's exactly that
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prototype mothership pipe here at book
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to dab it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puke and Beagle carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned that dab into nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I barely feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a decent sized dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed it, but I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to come here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, it smells so turvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also hitting like mad low temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: 470 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel good, LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn that thing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you Johnny?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll get you ready,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B's about to go in on a dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop it in here for you,
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get your carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B, hitting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking shit about someone,
I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good, I should wear a
t-shirt that says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go home and watch your videos and just
hear all this smack talk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been videoing anyone,
but you just hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say after that, Liam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was beautiful that you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty sweet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful piece.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one Johnny fucking B passing the
joint over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch that on video real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little tiny fucking dab,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
Oh, give me the tear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was like 80 dabs of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 dabs of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's super smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipe seems like it's almost not
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a huge fucking chonger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so fucking like Vito.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is going on right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the weirdest thing ever to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're not even smoking
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I want to know is why and how.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like turning into rotten pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's turning into rotten pineapple?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fucking dab me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have this unique funky smell to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Dragonfire's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then that's like loud,
funky, kind of sweet though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's the one that seems the most
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull it right out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's... We are undercharging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even understand the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, does anyone do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like...
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be some of the best flavor you've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: How smooth is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you giving this to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all you.
Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have to give you the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got lots of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull that SV?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a dab like that in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B's just dropping shit while he's
taking his dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just knocking shit over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking giving everyone a heart attack in
the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even fucking blinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a professional, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking at the bubble, the 90U that
we squished into the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bubbly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosebud goodness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you Monday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Book club.
[SPEAKER_00]: January 20, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave a bunch of dabs, broken the
mothership pipe, and it's time to head
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to Whistler in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't have to, but I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, have a good night, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
