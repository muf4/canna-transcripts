[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and Well, I wanted to do a little show
[SPEAKER_00]: today Giving you guys a little bit more of
a tease of some of my life up in Whistler
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the Pemberton area backcountry I
had quite a few emails and messages from
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys asking me about Different
different concepts and you know asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: where I ride where what kind of sled I
ride and what you know Whether I do the
[SPEAKER_00]: ice climbing whether I do Crampons what
kind of split boarding and so I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to give you guys a little
background I've been doing backcountry
[SPEAKER_00]: photography up in Whistler for the last
four or five years Not professionally by
[SPEAKER_00]: any means but really more as a hobby just
whatever gets me out there I get to ride
[SPEAKER_00]: with awesome riders got a really good crew
for this for this Snowmobiling aspect my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Ryan Nadeau who you may or may not
have seen in my Facebook feed but he is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of one of my mentors in the sled
world and he sort of brought me under his
[SPEAKER_00]: wing and took me in and brought me to some
of these amazing places that I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: show you today and Today, I'm just gonna
do three part clip three different clips
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna add into this video and I'll
talk a little bit before each one But the
[SPEAKER_00]: the area is Rutherford Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Pemberton ice caps and it's about
maybe ten minutes South of Pemberton and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20 25 minutes north of Whistler on
the Sea to Sky Highway There's a creek bed
[SPEAKER_00]: there and there's a sort of little turn-in
parking lot on the right side and the left
[SPEAKER_00]: side and I think now they're actually
Plowing the road so you end up paying 15
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20 bucks each time you go up there as
the road is fairly long and so after
[SPEAKER_00]: driving up to Whistler Pemberton area
takes me an hour an hour and a half from
[SPEAKER_00]: my house takes me another 45 to an hour
just to get the sled off The truck and get
[SPEAKER_00]: ridden up into the Alpine and then that's
where we're gonna start this video today
[SPEAKER_00]: so this video the first video is we're
gonna go up to a ridge I'm following my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Ryan and Enjoy
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry about a thing Take it easy and
never give in Don't worry about a thing
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it easy and never give in Life is not
hard as it seems Take it one day at a time
[SPEAKER_09]: and fulfill your dreams Remember no one is
an island no one stands alone In your
[SPEAKER_09]: doings always remember your theme Always
things get hard and lean Hold on to your
[SPEAKER_07]: faith and fulfill your beam and don't
worry about a thing Take it easy and never
[SPEAKER_07]: give in Don't worry about a thing Take it
easy and never give in Test of time,
[SPEAKER_09]: test of patience Just like in the days of
patience Remember the man called Joe He
[SPEAKER_09]: tried it the rocky road He know where he
was going so he know where he was coming
[SPEAKER_09]: from Believe in yourself my friend As you
pursue Just think how wide you go to And
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you worry, worry about a thing All
right so that was an absolutely beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: video you have to admit some of that fresh
pow pow you may not have seen Ryan and
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris till the end of the video they were
quite a bit ahead of me and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the few tracks that were ahead of me were
theirs so once we get up onto the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: that ridge we ended up dropping down to
the right driving a little bit more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sleds up into the ice caps and then we
found a really nice little sort of open
[SPEAKER_00]: face mountain that we were able to drive
up on our sleds right up on our sleds jump
[SPEAKER_00]: off you know put the boards on put the
skis on and then send the sleds down ghost
[SPEAKER_00]: riding ghost riding is really only
possible when there's no trees or rocks or
[SPEAKER_00]: crevasses that are potentially going to be
in between you and where you're sending
[SPEAKER_00]: the sled it does still feel a little
sketchy to do but I'll tell you when you
[SPEAKER_00]: just rip down on your on your snowboard
and then your sleds just sitting there it
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the just most beautiful things
so this is me snowboarding up on
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutherford Creek just a real quick clip
enjoy
[SPEAKER_09]: people always ask me see why you so
humble?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't smoke they cuck in that's why I
don't grumble
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow motion there where you can kind of
see the power and the speed that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going by first slowing it down
and when the slow motion turned to fast
[SPEAKER_00]: motion, which was really just regular
life, it seemed like I was trucking pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say a solid 70 kilometers an hour or
50 miles an hour for my American brethren
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time for a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've watched two clips and I haven't hit
one, so I'm going to hit three rips right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, starting with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Rutherford Creek is where I'm
going to try and bring you guys again this
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got plans to go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area where we found the ice
cave, so we definitely want to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys the ice cave this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teased and threatened probably two or
three times in my videos that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be making a hash in the Pemberton ice caps
up in the ice cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to share a video of the ice
cave today because literally I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys to see it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fresh when we show up
with the hash screens and the bags and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of my most excited projects
that, jeez, that's really going,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I better finish my rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little more in there than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a quick number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some really nice Astro Boy here
sitting out on the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: 73 micron, well cured, six months plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, that hit right there,
that's a hit that you take a few seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: after you rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe one more of this very nicely
aged cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first hit I took was actually the
CBD Renee pressed out into a lovely disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pancake patty, whatever you would like to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second rip was the Astro Boy that's
out here on the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little left of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final one is going to be this
really old Hindu Kush that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to say older than five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I love about a cured
bubble is when I drop it into the D-nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: it almost just, I don't want to say
explodes, because there's no combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I'm telling you, the vapor is
instant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can tell the first hit I put in
was a little bit more fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dry sift, but it was just dry sift
that I believe wasn't able to get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really bone dry wax membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver Island can do that to you with
all that humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three wonderful rips made up for the few
rips that I didn't take while we watched
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last clip truly is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me peeking one of the mountaintops up
in the Pemberton ice caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truly, if ever there was a religious
experience to be had or a spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, for me, this was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch, enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: More to come soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you rooted and grounded?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to see
the youth go further than children,
[SPEAKER_09]: children go to school.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you graduate, you don't have to watch
or know the rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: People, people, they'll plan the food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't love the environment,
you shall surely lose.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water shall be one of the best
commodities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should protect life entirely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you rooted and grounded?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love

[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to see
the youth go further than leaders,
[SPEAKER_09]: leaders, leaders, the youth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to see
the youth go further than leaders,
leaders,
[SPEAKER_09]: the youth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water shall be one of the best
commodities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should protect our own liberty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you rooted and grounded?
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to see
the youth go further than things I know
[SPEAKER_09]: you've got to learn in life.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's how to love and how to organize it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't let no one move you where you
know you're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, don't let no one fool you when you
stand in the months of your life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to see
the youth go further young.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you rooted and grounded?
[SPEAKER_08]: I take the time of meditation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rooted and grounded.

[SPEAKER_09]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take the time of meditation just to love
a mother nature young.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand, sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: To say the least that you don't to my
sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do unto him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand,
brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: One man wants the world, it seems.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it makes no sense to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring a new pair of bars and use it to
suck the cheese.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand, brother.
Sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: To say the least that you don't to my
sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do unto him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the man said the least that you don't
to my sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do unto him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we stand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Together we stand, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Together we stand, brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the man said the least that you don't
to my sisters.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do unto him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Together we stand, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the herbs burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I say herbs must be burned like your
teeth must be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather vital for spiritual hygiene.
[SPEAKER_03]: King Solomon certified the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he is the wisest man known to we.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I and I shouldn't forget when they
preach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herb never harm not a sound true speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: So meanwhile the sound call leaders
deceive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man obligated to clarify and teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man of herbs burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man of herbs burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smoke marijuana till me eye them purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get a bomb drop from me friend them
purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we must say him have the highest
count.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just get it from the higher mount.
Right.
