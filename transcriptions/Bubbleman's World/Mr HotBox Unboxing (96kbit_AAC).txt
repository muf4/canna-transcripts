[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's going on everybody welcome to
bubble man's world I'm here for with Zan
[SPEAKER_02]: from the mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox the vaporization from the future
company and I first heard about mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox and Zan from a good friend online
friend Adam also known as handmaid And I
[SPEAKER_02]: saw that he got one of your units and
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like dude that looks like a killer
little electric nail I also I also love
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that You guys had the battery
pack that came with it Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: why don't you tell us a little bit about
how you guys came to be in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: starting mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox Yeah, mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been around for about four years
now, and we originally started out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bellingham, Washington we Saw that there
was a need for an email that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: could last you forever And you can take
wherever you wanted and that's we filled
[SPEAKER_02]: that market Which is I guess kind of goes
hand-in-hand with why you offer a lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty on it exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're Hash smokers and we know that
we're sitting there with a torch every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day and we're like we need
something That's just gonna be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna give us yeah We're not
dealing with something that looks kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy here anything like that either so
that was The first mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox was born and then two years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our newest version of it So this
is mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox classic we went like how Apple had
went with The iPod classic back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: after they discontinued the first iPod So
this is like the new sleeker design that
[SPEAKER_00]: we we came out with that had our totally
our own circuit board It's designed by our
[SPEAKER_00]: own team, but one of the guys on our team
is a SpaceX engineer and It looks like it
[SPEAKER_02]: was engineered by a SpaceX engineer,
I'm not gonna lie Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly does so they got the bubble man
custom on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also got my logo on the back there
And they got their name right on the front
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Hotbox just a nice little unit I gotta
say like it feels like I could drop this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and that I would not be worried That
I broke it exactly beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've there's their videos on the
phone somewhere of us shooting the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one with like pellet guns and all dropping
it and throwing it and then plugging it on
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking some dabs out of the This is
truly like an indestructible email,
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the box Also, it's got some other
things in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's yeah stuffed it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're stuffed it good so this is our
power supply that allows you to It's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: boy, but it allows you to plug it into
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go over Switzerland Jamaica Africa
anywhere and depending if it's 110 volts
[SPEAKER_00]: AC or 220 it's all ready to go and And so
and for those of you that have seen my
[SPEAKER_02]: video at the Krasnopolski in Amsterdam at
the high times cannabis cup where I plug
[SPEAKER_02]: in my D nail and I'm getting things ready
and I'm getting it all organized and I
[SPEAKER_02]: come over to sort of feel the nail if it's
up and I look and the units flashing and I
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh shit Shit, I'm sure a few of
you remember that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was because the D nail at the
time I don't know if they fixed it since
[SPEAKER_02]: they only really set it up to be working
off I guess 120 110 110 volt North America
[SPEAKER_02]: not quite the 240 volts which is in Europe
and it fried my whip luckily I had an
[SPEAKER_02]: extra whip but That's one of the reasons I
ended up using the Dabinator, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: another electric nail company owned by a
friend of mine Max And so, you know for
[SPEAKER_02]: this one one of the main reasons I love
the fact that it's beefcake I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that it looks indestructible that
it's warrantied for life but one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things I was really really excited about
is That they make this little battery now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have one here because they're so
popular They've sold out of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're in the middle of manufacturing
some more and if you want to pass me that
[SPEAKER_02]: other battery It's smaller than the one
I've been using which this is just a not a
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good battery at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for maybe 20 to 30 minutes
They're claiming their battery is two to
[SPEAKER_02]: two and a half hours and they've done it
through experience It's not just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: theory and so two to two and a half hours
of a small little battery smaller than
[SPEAKER_00]: this in the same metal finish Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same metal finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then it has a long enough cable
So like you could even wrap around and
[SPEAKER_00]: just stick it underneath so you can just
how this whip feels great Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really loose and it's not It doesn't
feel like it's like too strong Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was one of the other many complaints
that we heard from about emails in general
[SPEAKER_00]: with that there was the whip was a pain in
the butt the What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either out of Kevlar and it made it
so it would That's your bowl, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you go upside down or right side
up I do it upside down like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I personally just to keep the tight
and nice in there, too Yeah, that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like a loose fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a puking beagle in this one just
because we thought it would be a nice idea
[SPEAKER_02]: to Transfer the the the whip but the way
this fits I don't think we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: to transfer the whip at all I think we'll
be able to transfer the entire yeah hole
[SPEAKER_02]: and just put this one away You know cuz
that's Usually it doesn't pull out so nice
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really nice Concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah having it not be so loose and having
it I mean it feels snug in there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted something that was snug but
because if you have an air gap we were
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that it was it doesn't really give
you an accurate temperature reading and so
[SPEAKER_00]: like people people we've seen other nails
have an air gap people have their nails
[SPEAKER_00]: set to like 800 degrees or something and
then they're still getting like low temp
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs on their nail and I'm like,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well played Something that you noticed
well in the sense that If the thing isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: tight around the core, it's you definitely
not gonna get that accurate temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you press the power button five
times to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a safety like a vape pen Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it to prevent someone turning it
on or off especially with the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly and so right now it's set to
283 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the temperature that said
about 580.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 5 5 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 600 but Sometimes you'll get it down
to like 550 or something like that or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit lower but if you want to just
change the the temperature you just click
[SPEAKER_00]: the up or down arrow right here,
so Depending on what temperature you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just click the arrow to your
heart's content and then the check mark
[SPEAKER_00]: here Is the menu function so that allows
you to change the safety timer so it
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically sets to 30 minutes So like
you click the check mark again to select
[SPEAKER_00]: that menu function, but so you can 30
minutes 120 240 or 480 minutes depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on your session time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for 480 because it's it prevents
it from shutting out off when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to and then to exit the menu you
just select exit menu and then if you Want
[SPEAKER_00]: to change it between Celsius and
Fahrenheit you can go into the units
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and go select it and We have a story
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Hotbox that he's a robot from the
future from the year 2057 He beat all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other vaporizers in the great vaporizer
war nice gimmicky name but so we say the
[SPEAKER_00]: global standard for the year 2057 is
Celsius and the The other option is
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit So you can change it to
Fahrenheit if you'd like to and it works
[SPEAKER_01]: just the same either way perfect beautiful
nice and easy and clean and and tight and
[SPEAKER_00]: so when you're ready to power up the coil
you just click the coil power button and
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts heating nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so does it let you know what it's got
up to temperature or does it show?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just you're looking at the actual
tip right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's starting to climb I kind of
have a feeling that it would show us the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature climbing Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the H also lets you know that the
coils on so like if it's off the H will go
[SPEAKER_02]: away or hot Yep, exactly Beautiful well
played well played and what else you got
[SPEAKER_02]: some other accessories here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah carbs and such Yeah, so this is a
little carb cap that mimics our actual mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox design that fits our quartz nails
and our titanium nails This is the head to
[SPEAKER_00]: our titanium nails so it you can fit both
both of them on this That fits nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: tight on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should fit even if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool and then so then we also have a
So that's like You can vaporize flower out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is which we have a bunch of jars of
thank you Dragonfly Earth medicine for the
[SPEAKER_02]: lovely flavors that we're gonna hit here
today Yeah, it's this is something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designed this I've never seen one that
it's like a little Cartridge so like your
[SPEAKER_00]: coil goes around this top piece will show
you here shortly but and then you grind up
[SPEAKER_00]: your herb throw it in this little
compartment and just slide it in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little pizza oven and just starts vaping
away like a volcano and What oh what would
[SPEAKER_00]: you grind it up with you can grind it up
with a mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox grinder I asked him or I was like,
I'm gonna go get a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I got one of those two So yeah,
this is one we made for bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has his logo on it that but we made a
grinder that has a unique teeth design
[SPEAKER_00]: that Allows it to actually cut your flower
instead of just ripping and smashing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of like tearing apart Well,
that's what innovation is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many grinders are there out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still room in my opinion to create
a grinder that actually grinds up the herb
[SPEAKER_02]: in a proper way rather than what he's
saying which is ripping and smashing it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a Quite a good little sound on
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool Super lightweight too for what
it's made out of like beefcake again,
[SPEAKER_02]: but super lightweight Mr. Hotbox,
very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is just the head door
titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that Base of our herb attachment
and titanium nail are the same So if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to smoke herb or vaporize,
okay, you can just nice you can do it Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: deep dish and it mean we tried to design
our quartz and titanium nails to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like The fact that it's very beefy,
you know, I've got of course Corey Cotton
[SPEAKER_02]: who produced created a beautiful little
Drop down for my pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a gift from flat 421 I've broken it
since and waiting on him to come pick it
[SPEAKER_02]: up, which is actually supposed to happen
today or tomorrow He's gonna pick up the
[SPEAKER_02]: remnants and said for sure he can fix it
for me So generally, you know this this
[SPEAKER_02]: feels really light as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Wow, really nice and how hot does
it get when you've got you can hold it You
[SPEAKER_02]: can hold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the key right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice the quartz I have no problem
putting right into the stem of my mother
[SPEAKER_02]: ships because quartz generally even with a
hot whip on it I can usually grab them at
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom and lift it out and and
Interchange it although with mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox because it fits so nice and tight
on the top of the quartz bowl I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: worried that it's gonna fall out and I'm
definitely not worried that this part is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get super hot and affect the best of
all of my pipe these however, I will say
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm Less comfortable with the smaller
ones that I've seen putting them right
[SPEAKER_02]: into the pipe just because they can get
really hot they can start expanding and
[SPEAKER_02]: the glass can can eventually produce
cracks in them also Having someone put
[SPEAKER_02]: this into your bistable that maybe isn't
paying attention You can chip it and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, these mother ships aren't cheap So
you want to take good care of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: But today we are gonna try the herb
attachment without a drop-down and I would
[SPEAKER_02]: love to be able to try that later on for
sure cool-looking unit man, I really think
[SPEAKER_02]: this is You're on to something right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a cool way to be able to load and
unload the herb dish Yeah, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that it was a long time coming
and finally enough people were like I love
[SPEAKER_00]: love mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox, but I'd only use it if I could
vaporize flour All right, like that's Just
[SPEAKER_00]: wait and got contacted that same person
within a week It was like we made the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we we thought about for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this all looks just beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super Excited to get a rip in so
that's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bunch of different maple
Butters, I've got these ones which is from
[SPEAKER_02]: heavenly days And then I've even got a
little Frenchy cannoli water hash that we
[SPEAKER_02]: should definitely probably rip up just
because it's the last that I have and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full full flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know if you want to have
yourself the first rip off the unit Sure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours Yeah, well, that's true enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I just see drove up you were so
Generous and kind to come all the way up
[SPEAKER_02]: with your time But I won't say no to a
rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, my tolerance is still mildly
low But that's what building tolerance is
[SPEAKER_02]: all about having some rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm gonna hit the Juanita Mmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing about this Juanita as you hit it
through your pipe and then everything
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes like Juanita It's got such a strong
terpene profile really nice nice resin
[SPEAKER_02]: from It's called Juanita la lagrimosa
Flower rosin one gram and that is from my
[SPEAKER_02]: good friends at maple butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I should probably use your
Yeah, exactly So make sure that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did just do some photographs Pretty much
carbs that are nice, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because a little bit I think it's
good on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Excited to have a little rip and when
I say little I really do mean little Not
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting this the monster dabs,
but we'll build it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back Not that I ever really hit
monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge monster dab guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be more of a Of the youth
taking taking gram and gram two gram dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like whoa So yeah, it's just nice to
see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the whip and the blue light on the
front of the unit That's real nice kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool that you've got these at first
when I saw these unique Inserts for how
[SPEAKER_02]: you plug in the whip and the plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of like oh shit I won't be able
to use any of my current whips,
[SPEAKER_02]: but You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a nice whip that comes with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to Get myself an extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we can we can get you any other
whips that you need and yeah These oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry to cut you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying that the connectors make
it so this is technically IP 65 so like
[SPEAKER_00]: you could technically Break your bong on
top of it and it's not going to short out
[SPEAKER_00]: your the mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotbox or the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like these are splash proof slash water
resistant buttons as well as Connectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a huge bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's why we have a different
connectors is that screws It and seals it
[SPEAKER_00]: in versus a lot of the other connectors,
you know One of the things you'll find out
[SPEAKER_02]: there is when companies offer you a
lifetime warranty on their product It
[SPEAKER_02]: means one of two things either a they're
completely fucking insane or B Which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: guessing is the case in this case as well
as the case for me with bubble bags We
[SPEAKER_02]: build the products so well and so good
That we eliminate the majority of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that people would require Warranty
from in the first place and if you can
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminate all those sort of stupid little
Mistakes mishaps, then what you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is you're warranting the product for
things that actually would require a
[SPEAKER_02]: warranty And when you've done it properly,
it's not hard to offer a lifetime warranty
[SPEAKER_02]: because the product is built properly I
mean the fact that it's got buttons that
[SPEAKER_02]: are waterproof and the seals on both the
power and the whip being splash proof
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, how many times have
you seen a pipe or a glass of water go
[SPEAKER_02]: over?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happened numerous times and it's
been fine each time Alright, well shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox and shout out to mothership and
shout out to maple butter because those
[SPEAKER_02]: three companies at this point in time are
Making this rip for me the bubble man
[SPEAKER_02]: possible give thanks
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the little hole of the carb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great able to really sort of get
around
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're gonna hit that one,
you should hit it out of this pipe And
[SPEAKER_02]: then we should hit the other flavors out
of this one because I'm telling you yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not gonna taste anything else It
smells amazing tastes amazing and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: three rips already on a tiny little blast
Wow
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll go for a little cleaning
Oh, thanks to glob mops as well for making
[SPEAKER_02]: this a easy clean We're both obsessed Zan
and I with obviously keeping our Our bowls
[SPEAKER_02]: clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although if you saw my puking beagle
before I pulled it out, it was anything
[SPEAKER_02]: but clean It's a little dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could possibly do your own
q-tips for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I think that would be a really smart
idea ones that are just I mean not that
[SPEAKER_02]: these don't fit good They actually fit
nice and snug and I'm not finding that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a danger to flip them around and
clean that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah perfectly But something that you
could possibly do mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you read our minds But that's to be
expected Wow, thank you maple butter rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: that is just a nice light high Completely
the opposite from the heavenly days rock
[SPEAKER_02]: star 73 micron bubble hash pressed into
rosin, which is this ridiculous white
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin this stuff is like Super intense
full body full full mind Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, look at that Pretty exciting New
electric nail one that I can travel with
[SPEAKER_02]: with a battery Most excited is Is my
current situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am currently most excited I've had a
bunch of great products sent to me
[SPEAKER_02]: recently that I'm gonna be doing more
unveiling and unboxing videos as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: the the full package from vape exhale and
But today it's all about mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hotbox I obviously love any type of unit
that allows me to use my current glass You
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the ability to hit out of my mother
ships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that they're great pipes I
know that there's a huge hype on them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but truly the way they hit the perks the
uniqueness the thought and the concept
[SPEAKER_02]: that Scott has put into these as well as
the rest of the blowers that work with him
[SPEAKER_02]: and our part owners and It's hard to say
that they haven't done a great fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's they're fantastic
pieces to hit and Unlike any other I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember years ago when mothership was
less known of and people walking around
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary just like hitting them and I
was like What type of pieces are these
[SPEAKER_00]: there this hits like literally the best
that I've hit in I agree with you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that's why sometimes people They get
it mixed up and maybe you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe there's a there is a Bunch of hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the pipes definitely got very
expensive and it was the thing to have but
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's really the hype is there
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what I mean that it
actually has a foundation in reality Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: which these pipes are great fucking pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know the first time I hit a fat
bag I just wanted one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was my God not because I
thought it was like a Ferrari and cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: people would think that I was cool if I
own Yeah, it was that I I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it the intake like the breath that
you get it just Like clean and absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: no restriction really no restriction at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beautiful So you've also got a really
cool little vaporizer unit here that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have You know, I think D Nail sent me
something years ago and it just it was
[SPEAKER_02]: weird I don't know it was like a glass
thing or something Yeah with a like a
[SPEAKER_01]: heater on top of it or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and and don't get me wrong because
that one of the first vaporizers that I
[SPEAKER_02]: really hit that absolutely destroyed me
was this Dutch guy and It was also the
[SPEAKER_02]: heater on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just trying to remember the name
subliminator No, no way before the
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator way before the sublimator
that's on Rico and that also was a very
[SPEAKER_02]: unique hit Yeah, a little bit more,
you know that you have to pay attention
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's got this big sort of hand and
it was a little bit more Dangerous in that
[SPEAKER_02]: sense, but no this was years prior His
name was Everett the gentleman who had the
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer and it was so not always had
This house and it was the first time I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: this vaporizer was in 1995 at the canvas
cup And it was it was like it had this big
[SPEAKER_02]: heater that sat on top of like a jar It
was at Lucky Mother's and let me tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: that vaporizer It's very big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very it's got he's got like a big
glass bong and the piece that goes into it
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like something that's very
portable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, even though it kind of started as a
portable idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the jar around his Waist and
whatnot, but this this is a great concept
[SPEAKER_02]: and an idea to Offer to people with
electric nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's definitely I don't
consider it an opera a way to vaporize But
[SPEAKER_02]: when I have my yeah, yeah just plugged in
all day long, but if I can just pop it off
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and put it onto another unit Yeah,
you can just throw it on Gentle gentle
[SPEAKER_02]: little unleash I can put that it's not
even hot If I touched it here,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would burn my fingers very badly,
but on the on the bottom of the the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost no heat whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this it just the coil goes around
the top like this So it's heating the
[SPEAKER_00]: intake air like like a volcano basically
just has like a heat gun inside the base
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and most other Vaporizers just have
like a heat gun and that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: producing that hot air or like a coil
Yeah, and you sucking through it is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah heating the air so this Is this is
our version of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hit it more like a vape pin versus
like clearing a bowl or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit lighter of a hit because
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, you just can put it on your
regular bomb and just ready to go grind up
[SPEAKER_00]: some power and then you just can easily
just Throw throw your flower into the
[SPEAKER_00]: little compartment Insert your compartment
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the reasons the sublimator is so
effective in it In fact just noticing this
[SPEAKER_02]: it would probably be a best idea if you're
using this to have the pan Inside the unit
[SPEAKER_02]: before you fill it get it warm,
you know, maybe not blazing hot You don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to burn yourself, but you would
definitely want to get this little dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that something you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I was actually gonna say
You read my mind actually cuz that yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz they We found that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested a whole bunch of different
times like just loaded up a cool Cartridge
[SPEAKER_00]: and just start hitting it and it takes
about like 20 seconds or 15 seconds before
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually get some milk Unless it's in
there unless it's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you either heat it beforehand and
Then loads of power in it and then or you
[SPEAKER_00]: load your flower in and then just let it
sit for a couple seconds like five to ten
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and then start pulling through and
that that just gives enough time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual little Pan sounds, you know,
so cool design.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely like it's to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much like a personal Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean sure you could share with a
buddy or two but the way an electric nail
[SPEAKER_02]: can be shared with Hundreds of people is
kind of unparalleled in the industry Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: for how fast it is to load and clean and
load and clean and it's always hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going Yeah, it's probably not
gonna be like that with the vaporizer of
[SPEAKER_02]: the herb You know, you could probably bust
up a bunch of herbs And I guess in a sense
[SPEAKER_02]: you could have a few of these already But
you really that's almost a design for a
[SPEAKER_02]: mass unit for a dispensary where you have
a small Like little design that just fits
[SPEAKER_02]: these things a whole bunch of them hot
Yeah, and so you pull them out you stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: them with the herb you put them in the
thing That would be a good way in a in a
[SPEAKER_02]: blink to speed that process up Not that we
need to I mean you could hit concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: off this thing and how many concentrates
in a row?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really really need before?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pretty blasted just off the last
three rips of the one that was extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: tasty It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we pick an herb from from
the dragonfly Earth medicine crew?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember we both said the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what I was just thinking was
the mothership was it's just different
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, it's dense Light that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like British Columbia That's wild
like that that's You wouldn't I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at this fire you wouldn't think that was
like All right, they're really
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable in their soil and the the
soil food web and You know the way they
[SPEAKER_02]: feed and the intention that is behind the
growing I really like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were totally responsible for the last
episode of hash church the soil edition
[SPEAKER_02]: where they got some just wonderful people
in to talk about You know the science of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil the spirituality of soil like it was
everything Yeah, they had Swami on there
[SPEAKER_02]: and him and Nikki were just given one
perspective while you have this guy column
[SPEAKER_02]: dropping hardcore knowledge on on compost
It was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I learned a lot And I like
that about hash church.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everyone loves about hash
church I'm usually in the conversation and
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the people that are kind of in the
know on that particular conversation Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with soil it was it was very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like a noob.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot to be learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Give thanks to the dragonfly Earth
medicine Shelton them out and this is all
[SPEAKER_02]: their herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Star-killer crossed with bubble crush
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah mothership going in the mothership
yeah, that's that's like earthy yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's So is there a little trick to not
burning yourself when you pull this out I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess you just want to push a little in
yeah, it's just I mean kind of my yeah my
[SPEAKER_00]: technique is get a little pinch and then
just Kind of push it down No, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: luckily there's not I mean the edge of
this little dish is there's so little
[SPEAKER_00]: surface contact that it's Yeah,
it's not gonna burn you that and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you if you want to have it a
little cooler You can always just put it
[SPEAKER_02]: in obviously realize that the terpenes are
volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So You know you want to hit them both at
the same time You want to get that heat at
[SPEAKER_02]: the right temperature the minute the heat
is exposed to the to the turps because the
[SPEAKER_02]: turps start evaporating pretty Much
immediately and you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: capture those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to try it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if we should try it out of this
This pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just so I can actually taste the bud
Taste the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting No carb on this necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hit it like a big pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I didn't even turn up the temperature
a little bit Sorry space out What time are
[SPEAKER_00]: we going to so we so good so we're gonna
crank it up to 300 degrees Celsius because
[SPEAKER_00]: so Because you're heating the air that's
going through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's It you heat it up a little bit hotter
than you normally then your normal vape
[SPEAKER_00]: temps that you'd like set on a volcano or
another vaporizer The first taste was
[SPEAKER_02]: insane really yeah, I'm telling you insane
It's almost worth leaving it at 280 Not
[SPEAKER_02]: right away What I was gonna say is leave
it at 280 hit your first rip then turn it
[SPEAKER_02]: up because when he turned it up This thing
went up in temperature fast like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: already at the temperature that he set it
to That
[SPEAKER_02]: was great dude like all the way down to
the end yeah here you take that one I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: grab this one passing ships through the
night You can tell it's very much Brown
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like I've done it was it was a very
Very very nice green look at the depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I gotta show them that Hopefully I
can at the angle that the camera's at so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can kind of see the difference in the
The grabbing as a grabbing It's always
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to tell but there's major differences
in the color there, so that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: substantially vaporized dish
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it came out beautifully Beautiful and
it's actually warm this time, so I suspect
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll get wow though the flavor on that
first rip I barely Exhaled anything there
[SPEAKER_02]: was this tiny little plume right at the
start, and then it was just pure flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like you don't want to be
exhaling it yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really nice I have to say that's
that's a great herb vaporizer Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit of a snob when it comes
to greater vaporizers I'm not I'm not a
[SPEAKER_02]: big fan of all the different kind of like
plastic hard Composite 10th yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of that yeah, not had a I In
cut when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy who had a volcano we
probably Smoked it almost every day at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point throughout the day,
so had had a lot of familiar Sorry that
[SPEAKER_00]: first out with the volcano so I was like
that's Yeah, I want something that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: at least hit well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely and you know what nothing
against volcano They set the bar very
[SPEAKER_02]: early on in the late 90s early 2000s with
that unit It's a total hospital friendly
[SPEAKER_02]: unit it removes all concept of prohibition
And you know getting people to think in a
[SPEAKER_02]: different mindset But at the same time
there's no comparing the rip that you get
[SPEAKER_02]: off of a good sort of Vaporizer that's
designed to actually vaporize the herb
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of what the pipe that you're
smoking out of you is For me the pipe is a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it to Filtering that that vapor
through that pipe Depending on the perk
[SPEAKER_02]: and the amount of water that's present and
just the feel of the glass is a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience to me Yeah To me too,
and that's that's love the volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great unit, but that yeah I was the
one lacking thing for me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like I got my piece that I like
Smoking through gives me a really clean
[SPEAKER_00]: hit I'd like to be able to add that mm-hmm
have that functionality Yeah to the pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: that I like well sure you know opened up
the ability for me to have a little Vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: up every once in a while through yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavors This is great man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you glad that you popped up today
Yeah, thank you for having me make a
[SPEAKER_02]: little video on bubble man's world I know
I haven't made a ton of videos lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely been a little under the
weather In that sense just having hurt my
[SPEAKER_02]: leg, but I'm feeling a lot better It just
goes in Even awkwardly with my arm like
[SPEAKER_02]: this just those are nice Yeah,
and the crazy thing about that herb
[SPEAKER_00]: attachment is until we started making them
they they have the tolerances within like
[SPEAKER_00]: within a thousandth of an inch and that's
in more precise than a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are made these days and so
like to Yeah, we're like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically has the tolerances of an
airplane or like Anything air aerospace
[SPEAKER_00]: great or anything like that wow and unlike
many other things on the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it was Nice to be able to pull it out
and look at the color mm-hmm and know that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still a little something something
left.
