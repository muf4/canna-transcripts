[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to a little sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little sesh in Negril.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally got to the place that I'm staying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we could wait a few seconds to see
if more people are coming into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who's in the room because I
don't actually see any talking yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll just patiently wait for a
few folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 252 here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't see any typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that starts to come in soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually like to see the typing,
and that lets me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any words to be said?
[SPEAKER_01]: No typing still.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: 73 people now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some messages are seen as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All messages are visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't see anyone's typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orientation is locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll just pretend that you're all
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delayed, but it just popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: 81 people in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here at Lantresant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check it out online,
it's beachcliff.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful little facility, little place
here owned by the good Dr. Craig and his
[SPEAKER_01]: wife Sherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little tennis court.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got about four acres here in
Negril right on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a private beach over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a private beach behind the
tennis court over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some beautiful epic trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I thought we would do was we could
have a little session.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to get your pipes,
your joints, whatever it is you're puffing
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could have a little session
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this banger is actually a banger
that goes with the product from Mr. Hotbox
[SPEAKER_01]: that sits on the beam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits like on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the beam heats it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little piece of metal that goes
under here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never actually used this banger
with a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may get a hot dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may get a too cool of a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Anthony, you're just going to have to
get more ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to say what's going on, Joe Dalton
and what's up, bubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wagwan, bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: You in a cottage in Negril?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in this really fucking sweet place in
Negril.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Private beach over that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennis court right over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ocean front in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your purple fab egg on IG?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was a friend of mine's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the pipes I post that aren't just
clear are generally friends of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless I specifically say that it's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Jamaican dude with the
windblower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just wind blowing for about an hour
and a half straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally had to ask him, when are you
going to stop wind blowing, leaf blowing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he told me a little bit ago,
within five minutes he quit, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: he's now already forgotten and he's coming
back around the side of the building to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some more blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jamaica style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm video now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all saying what's up to the
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 years, 26 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: 26 years in gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man knows how to garden right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only going to do this for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can just keep the sound down just
for a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing dabs right now on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your most expensive piece B man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and brick were wondering if you don't
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got pieces that are old.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be worth 25 or $30,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: He definitely grows ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: He offered me some ganja earlier and he
definitely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to grow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better hit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have to do a little bit of
work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this today from, from uncle stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure if you guys are familiar with
uncle stoner, but he lent me this torch
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and saw him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just leaving back for the U S
[SPEAKER_01]: this banger on clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it 20 seconds or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny little bit of crud in there that's
smoking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep it nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when I'm puffing in Jamaica,
it's a little bit hard with lack of DC
[SPEAKER_01]: glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a whole thing of Q-tips,
but when I'm feeding hits out to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, I find that it definitely becomes
difficult to keep it as clean as I would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to just with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll go 42 52 to, so yeah,
about 57 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will hit this at, and I guess I better
get a dab little cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love the tech temp USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the way to go personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their little unit is a laser thermometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits right underneath your banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You roll your banger over it or you roll
it under your banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you, it is the most
accurate rip I've gotten from a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no comparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely no comparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say, you know, I can't tell
if this banger is going to hold heat or
[SPEAKER_01]: release heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm even going to get probably because
I'll wait longer than I, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I would, you know, I'm not going to
go too quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably get a low temp dab before I
get a real hot one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's check it out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chas still a liquid in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather hit this every day of every
minute, but if I got to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited because I'm about to walk you
guys around this property now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured that's what I do for a live
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try and film some videos with
the 4k camera and the GoPro and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: give you guys a little bit of a show that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I never get around to editing
and sometimes it just takes so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know how much people appreciate
seeing things in the moment when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proof is that we have a hundred and
seventy five people in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why don't we walk over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little too far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have to stay a little closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how long, how far the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does the, how much does the
internet suck here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to take you guys for a
little cruise, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some beautiful trees over there,
but this is all the better reason for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to just have a couple of puffs and have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can film this place with my 4k GoPro
and camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe go do some, some fully
checking out the property and then you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to check it out on a, on a YouTube
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause right now this is not the best way
to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm, yeah, I found the sweet spot
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to stay in the sweet spot so
we don't go paused again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost almost half of our viewers when it
went down like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just have no understanding
of how tenacious and committed I am to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to, to pumping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen
the conversation that's out and about
[SPEAKER_01]: about phylos biosciences and a lot of
things that genomics, uh, medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics are saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we all released something from the DEM
pure family today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram, a lot of, uh, statements
were made and I don't think it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong and we need to promote,
you know, conscious no-till organic
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farming because these are the
expressions that we want in our hashes and
[SPEAKER_01]: our extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think the statement was some,
there, there is some confusion in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to what actually happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are thinking that,
uh, that Mowgli and his team basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, took samples from everyone
and then tissue cultured those samples and
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that did not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's not something that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are a little pissed off about
that, even though it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that did happen is they did
request, um, genetic sampling,
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA sampling from all these 4,000 plus,
you know, um, samples that everyone gave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then they announced just a little
while ago that they're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're claiming that the breeding
would have anything to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics they collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the community feels as though that's
not the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people feel a little,
uh, a little bummed out about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if we're still online here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we still online?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think that we're online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'll make another, uh,
cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 140 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause right now it's doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like it's not live,
but I'll just keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of one of the
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do a HashChurch where we can get
a bunch of the people who really have an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea what they're talking about when it
comes to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and have an open conversation
about it on HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think HashChurch is really a great
platform for us to get, to get together
[SPEAKER_01]: and that there's no, there's no team.
[SPEAKER_01]: HashChurch is not a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a combination of all the
people from the community and we're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for or against.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of having the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that one of the problems with
society today is that when we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we make mistakes, when we do things
that are looked down upon, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: society, people want to hold those people
in that energy forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even want to have conversations
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain things nowadays you can't
even have a conversation about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why so many comedians are not
touring colleges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's really where this whole thing
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started in universities and colleges,
they compel speech, they pass laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then they get to define what is
hate and what is, you know, okay to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about and what is not okay to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a firm believer that everything should
be talked about if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that even if you disagree with
someone greatly, that you should still be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to sit across a table from them
without slinging insults and talking down
[SPEAKER_01]: to them and getting into, uh, into war
basically that, which is what people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I've fallen into it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying I'm void of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, don't move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not moving it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Church must survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not something I can do
every Sunday, especially when I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: countries like Jamaica, but, um,
it's still pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the Adam Dunn show had it the past
two weeks and I did enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that the hash church,
like, I think I watched the Adam Dunn and
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed very one sided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't seem like too many people were
representing, um, phylos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mildly called in one time and lots
of other people called in and it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that idea cause that's
something hash church can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Adam Dunn for being able
to put that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was on, I was in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost, I almost called in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, just inviting kind of the key
component people that are involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: passing this information, uh, whether
positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'd like to talk to, I'd like to have
Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have, um, Kevin McKernan,
Mowgli Holmes, you know, maybe Chimera,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe Dave Watson, maybe Rob Clark,
you know, like, I think that would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty incredible panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a few other people that I
don't quite know about yet, but I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: also have a deep knowledge of this and
have a deep understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hash church really feels, Oh,
I can't, I missed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, feels it more of a think tank with the
educated people in the right area with no
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of like a think tank,
but at the same time, you guys are all a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I read the chat room
throughout all of hash charts I have for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone and I engage and I bring up your
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever notice, I'll say something
that I read in the chat room and I then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, you know, James McDonough said,
how's Indra these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to, you know, promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you guys come up with that you're a
part of the discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's what is one of the
hardest things about me doing hash charts
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm moderating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interacting with all the people that
are in the room and I'm directing and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, carrying through with the
conversation while simultaneously engaging
[SPEAKER_01]: with the people in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the while people hitting me up on
Facebook, people hit me up on my own
[SPEAKER_01]: personal message.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hit me up on Instagram,
like endlessly trying to engage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say like, listen,
come into the YouTube chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say something good, I'll repeat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can, it can help direct the
conversation is what a yearly family trip
[SPEAKER_01]: for me, kid Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: 157, we got to get back up to 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about growing with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good call, Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Kevin, yeah, you should check out,
uh, well there's a ton of people to check
[SPEAKER_01]: out, but Dutch Blooms is a good one to
start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, um, Yeshua must be saved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Muhammad don't die for you and all others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll leave you be for now,
but if you keep spamming the room with
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I'll bounce you pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm all about people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's better to engage with the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to save Jesus and
Muhammad and everyone, like just engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation at hand and, and somehow
it'll be directed to what you want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about, but don't just like go off topic
and throw a big spam in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings from Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recommend a base for soil growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember around this time last year you
were in Jamaica and took a tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been in Jamaica a lot over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Jim Bernardo from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Sam H laughing his motherfucking ass
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no negative BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello Marcus from Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, hello from Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi from Ontario, my own country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So celebrate Liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech Liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't mean to send reading my indoor
gardening guide, but thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hello from Asheville, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pete Moss, homemade compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the actual general pros and cons
of indoor versus outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are done to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right off the bat, you're never
going to grow cannabinoids as cheaply in a
[SPEAKER_01]: field as you can in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at most people don't think
of the excessive waste that it takes to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow cannabis for water and electricity
and all the products and all the just
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging and shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like it, we got to do better
than what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think that's what the
dragon flight earth medicine crew is
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being conscious, listening to
the soil, trying to do the right things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you go back to the roots
unintended and just take care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Create these living soils, these living
biomes that used to just be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nature until we destroyed and killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to protecting these simple things,
allow these plants to express themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe lower the footprint on the
environmental costs to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, too much packaging in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in California, how much,
how much like those guys go through water
[SPEAKER_01]: like crazy, I'm sure for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they probably some of the largest
growers in the world can only imagine how
[SPEAKER_01]: much water they consume for growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sun is absolutely where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And packaging is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: London, Ontario, Trent Taylor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out Jay London.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell him the bubble man sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing and smoking on some wash wish
mountain and some wookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Curtis, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I've, I like the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing 50, 50 ocean forest cocoa
with roots organic dry minutes while
[SPEAKER_01]: Horace now very few problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: DM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: California oil extractor representing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering about Mark the weed guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mark, the weed guy disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to have no idea what happened to
Mark the weed guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, he was around constantly and all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he kind of had like, I had a
falling out with him, a little one,
[SPEAKER_01]: not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I saw him, I wouldn't be upset,
but he had a big falling out with his,
[SPEAKER_01]: his friends or Ramo, uh, and some other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, I believe he's married to a woman in
China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's probably in China, but he had a
strong social media following.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he also was a cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a pretty intense guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him years ago when he was,
I think he had just finished like putting
[SPEAKER_01]: his cancer into remission with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there will be rare seven 10,
but nothing I can talk about just yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, the second I can,
I'll be dropping it like beats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a hemp basically printing
filament?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bunch of health risk and atoms in
those, in those cartridges, mostly around

[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that caused me anxiety for some years
and I kind of understood what like anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely just tapping into that for
a very short period of time, I could
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the absolute and utter hell.
