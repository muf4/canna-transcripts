Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in Berlin, Germany today for the Mary
Jane Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so exhausted after the jet lag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really able to film.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to film as much as I can for
you guys today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also raining really badly yesterday
in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today it's a much nicer day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to get to walking around
the Mary Jane Expo, checking out a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of different booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the Full Moon Session going
on, which I was at yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really beautiful dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Igor and the whole team at
Full Moon Session for putting it together,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing me out to be a judge for the
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, later on in the week,
we're going to be doing the ICBC
[SPEAKER_01]: conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll try to film as much as I can in
the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bolt showing up, which is the
German equivalent of Uber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So see you down at the festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have hooked up with Mr. Dave Auger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have probably seen Dave in the
videos in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend from Alberta, Calgary,
Alberta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually a partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on a project in Arizona with
the Arizona Mounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be making bubble and live
hash rosins and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave's got mushroom licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got big league genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does export to Germany and some other
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's doing all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here in Berlin, Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on our way down to the Mary Jane
Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these funky little scooters that
we're riding, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Little limers on the trusty steeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Dave is also on a panel with me
at the ICBC conference in about a week on
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be fun too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not going to be able to film
the ride on the way to the Mary Jane Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be fun if I could because
Berlin is a beautiful city with beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some old, some new.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real mix of architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all ripped up and bubbled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already toured the entire place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm now at the business boat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sessions going on in the back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the summer is the positive effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just go back into the nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how does it look?
Oh,
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not even.
Nice
[SPEAKER_04]: to meet
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
Oh,
yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who do I bump into?
[SPEAKER_01]: But my boy, Alex Rogers from ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ivory white tower looking over
shit right now to tell us how sick the
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBC is in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Mary Jane's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that they both can happen at
the same time because they serve two
[SPEAKER_00]: different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is super like bringing the
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I and I, we support
cannabis culture and healing in the nation
[SPEAKER_00]: culture full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ICBC does that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just do it on this like a little
bit next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bring people from 80 different
countries from all around the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really, really, really,
really get down in terms of business
[SPEAKER_00]: policy and activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely looks from the outside like
it's a much more corporate event.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can say from someone who's been a
lot, it's really a nice mix of the
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate and the culture, the legacy
culture that kind of just combines this
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice sort of uber professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not wasting your time at an
ICBC conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're there to do business,
you're there to say export cannabis from
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find people to do that
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to sell equipment for
extraction, you're going to find people to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a consultant, you know,
whether it's from lighting or growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: processing, you're going to find people to
connect to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my first ICBC in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been to Vancouver ones and
Barcelona ones and always had a great
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but I'm super pumped on Berlin,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came out really for ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an honor bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fucking legend.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the words, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I probably couldn't have
said it more eloquently myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to get back to this
conference and or this expo and we will
[SPEAKER_01]: see you later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
