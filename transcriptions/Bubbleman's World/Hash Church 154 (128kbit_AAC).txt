[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 154.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two away from our three-year anniversary,
we wanted to give a shout out to all the
[SPEAKER_09]: guys and gals hanging out in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little Silver Diamond, Jianski's OG Slab
and of course, Melty Heads who gave us a
[SPEAKER_09]: good laugh this morning and Sean8033 for
joining me on my wake and bake the other
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I'm gonna send out the links
to our panel, our esteemed panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see how that works out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always interesting to see who will
come in first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally, it's gonna be Etienne for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_09]: He seems to make it his way in first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I should say, 155 of you have
already made it in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe Etienne isn't first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe today he's gonna be like 160th.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so been pulling off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's go indeed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rand Core in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should get going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send out some links here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Etienne has seen the link.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and there it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it doesn't take Etienne very
long.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within a minute, two minutes tops and he's
in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's so nice to hear your voice too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you might have pulled one of
these on me.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I restarted my computer beforehand to
make sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know how long I've been doing that
for?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing because sometimes you don't
and everything works fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: In like last couple of weeks, everything I
haven't set up the night before.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sit down and get up and I'm like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope you're having a good week
this week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to another nice
episode of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing major planned, but I did invite
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was asking forever flowering greenhouses
if he wanted to come back in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I invited Peter from Soil Balance and Wade
and Forrest, of course, from the
[SPEAKER_09]: Palladrius Network in the house of Harley
Quinn.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the regulars, you know,
lots of the regulars, D420K and Skunkman
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam and Tony and yourself and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's you and me.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should just puff a bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say there, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I think that's very doable.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you puffing on today?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a little bit of full melt,
a buble hash that I'm working away on
[SPEAKER_09]: here.
[SPEAKER_12]: What flavor?
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is holy grail.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do also have V.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just showing my entries that I have
for the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I get to be a judge for the
solventless entries.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they sent me they sent me 11 different
entries here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So throughout the episode, I may hit one
or two and write a few things in my little
[SPEAKER_09]: my little book here, you know,
with the we got all the categories written
[SPEAKER_09]: up quite quite beautifully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here for the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many how many samples are you going
through?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only got 11 to go through for
solventless.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, if you look at her actual
contest, she's got Indica, she's got Bud
[SPEAKER_09]: Hybrid, she's got Shatter Hybrid,
Shatter Indica, you know, pages and pages
[SPEAKER_09]: and pages and pages of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: She gets a lot of entries into this
contest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So different people are judging different
aspects, like some people or some people
[SPEAKER_12]: handing the edibles and yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are experienced people I take it
that are doing it or they're people who
[SPEAKER_12]: pay to get these.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she has a selection of both people
who are I mean, the Karma Cup is kind of a
[SPEAKER_09]: roots cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still very much like it hasn't really
transferred in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if you see it down in
California, I would suspect you absolutely
[SPEAKER_09]: do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But here in Canada, there are these cups
cup type events and there are these
[SPEAKER_09]: conference type events and they are both
very, very different.
[SPEAKER_09]: One is very roots and one is very
corporate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know what the corporate
events, for instance, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_09]: conference, everyone actually goes over to
a bar and drinks alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's not happening at the Karma
Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some people might go and enjoy an
IPA or a beer or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the most part, it's a it's a
puffing event for puffers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's exactly who will be their
hardcore puffers.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a numerical scoring system in that
little grid?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like do you have like three or four and a
one and a two?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes one to nine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other cool thing is once
you've done all your voting, you can
[SPEAKER_09]: actually she's given us a pass,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You get your pass and I won't show it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the back of my pass, there is a
username and a password.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that allows me to go online and
transfer all of my book information onto
[SPEAKER_09]: computers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the book is really for you to have to
keep your information, because who the
[SPEAKER_09]: hell is going to sit in front of a
computer and puff 12 varieties?
[SPEAKER_09]: And and you know, I like to be around out
in the world, wake and bakes, end of the
[SPEAKER_09]: nights, all these different ways that I
like to hit something.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a smart way of doing it,
because that way you can carry the book
[SPEAKER_08]: with you wherever you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you go along and then when you
sit down at the computer, put all the data
[SPEAKER_08]: in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cool thing about having a
numerical scoring system is now you can do
[SPEAKER_08]: statistics on it and you can do data
analysis and you can do all kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: different algorithms to look to see what
kind of trends you see in the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sarah is very computer savvy.
[SPEAKER_09]: She worked for years in IT.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's very smart, capable girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say that is that is exactly
something she's going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's outstanding data.
[SPEAKER_08]: Data is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can get your hands on data and
you're a data person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm going to start it off with a big
old rip of some of this bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hoping everyone's having a really nice
Sunday afternoon, even though it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: afternoon yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is afternoon for Skunkman Sam and
maybe late afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Six o'clock at night right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Six o'seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the six o'seven in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's noon on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's happening in Penseltucky there,
Doc?
[SPEAKER_08]: All kinds of things going on out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first groups that have field tests,
harvests for hemp are happening like in
[SPEAKER_08]: this last week or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so a lot of hemp crops are getting
mowed down, which is cool to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was communicating with one Adam
Thompson, the farmer up in Lycoman County
[SPEAKER_08]: in Pennsylvania, and they're turning their
stuff into a seed oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll be selling hemp seed oil and
making hemp seed oil from their their.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the variety?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they shared it with me once
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we talked about it on Hash
Church, but I can get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they turning the tops back into the
soil or what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a great thing to get them on
to Hash Church sometime to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly what they're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only limited acreage plots,
so they can't really do a whole lot in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of scale of economy to actually make
a profit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're very limited and you have to be
tied in with the university.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there has to be sort of like a purpose
to what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that one of the plots is
specifically for a fight over mediation of
[SPEAKER_08]: of a foul former steel mining site where I
guess they mine steel ore and there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: bunch of, you know, maybe not desirable
farm soil and maybe a lot of leftovers
[SPEAKER_08]: from the mining industry and the steel
industry that just sort of left a field
[SPEAKER_08]: that was kind of like cruddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was too cruddy to plant corn,
but they threw hemp seed down in it and
[SPEAKER_08]: the hemp took off there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think part of it is to reclaim land.
[SPEAKER_08]: But each individual plot, I think,
has to have some kind of research project
[SPEAKER_08]: with a local university tied to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can get an update and I'll come back
on Hash Church and let you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would give a shout out to Joe Strobel
and Jeff Kime from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the ones that accidentally
really kind of figured out the fight over
[SPEAKER_09]: mediation properties of cannabis by
planting it on tobacco fields in between
[SPEAKER_09]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was their first experimental field and
they knew the radiation levels of the
[SPEAKER_09]: field because they'd been spraying radium
226 for decades on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when they registered, when they
when they went through and and measured
[SPEAKER_09]: the plants, they were shocked at how much
radiation they had in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were then shocked as well at how
much less radiation was actually sitting
[SPEAKER_09]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was that was got to be 1993.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was really the reason our
company, CGP, started the Chernobyl fight
[SPEAKER_09]: over mediation project in the Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was it was done long before the
90s in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were experimenting with it in the
60s, the 70s, the 80s also.
[SPEAKER_09]: With radiation or just in the middles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was a study.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mostly heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Radiation, I'm almost certain they had no
idea it could pull up radiation until the
[SPEAKER_09]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree, because when I went and
dealt with that Ukrainian hemp,
[SPEAKER_12]: and then, of course, there was a study
that came out at the BIOFAC in 97 talking
[SPEAKER_12]: about how this industrial heavy metals
plant in Poland, they had done a similar
[SPEAKER_12]: situation where they remediated it with
growing of hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were astonished.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the first really big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't just a small trial.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it was really big.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really pulled up a lot of the heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it made the soilologists really sit up
and look and rethink about how to reclaim
[SPEAKER_12]: land using natural biodiversity as opposed
to, you know, in the past, just scrape the
[SPEAKER_12]: land off and move it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we ended up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they had to figure out what to do
with the contaminated hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not only that, they had to figure
out what to do with the contaminated land.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found that out being growing up in
southern Louisiana, all those levees and
[SPEAKER_12]: all that land that was built up,
that's all contaminated land.
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew because I would go as a kid and
roll down those levees and find 13,
[SPEAKER_12]: 17, 19 leafed clovers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That ain't good luck.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, really lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: The two options we were looking at was
burning and glassifying the ash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other one was an electron
cluster scientist from Russia who was
[SPEAKER_09]: using electron clusters to manipulate and
sort of take radiation, radioactive
[SPEAKER_09]: nucleotides, just literally take them
apart molecule by molecule.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he had this technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember that we were sitting down
talking to him at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure whatever became of it,
though.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Sam, are you familiar with this?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a group working on growing
hemp in Fukushima to see about if any type
[SPEAKER_12]: of remediation.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not been in contact with them
unless they're one of the Japanese groups
[SPEAKER_04]: that we were in contact with years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't know it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, because I know, I mean, since we're
talking radiation, that's the only one for
[SPEAKER_12]: sure that I know that's currently ongoing
where they're trying to figure out if
[SPEAKER_12]: there's, I mean, we all know that's an
uninhabitable area for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And way to clean up soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they got to do is figure out some
way that they can make rockets that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can shoot these things into space or
something so that we can get rid of the
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminated hemp once we got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like as good of an idea as
like pushing our sewage into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't they make fireworks out of
burnt hemp carbon?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had heard that in China.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have heard that, but I have not seen or
one of the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_09]: That seriously goes to show that there
really truly is 50,000 commercial products
[SPEAKER_09]: that you can make out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like a like a thneed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the old thneed from the Lorax?
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone needs a thneed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see why the religious right
basically thinks, man, this is too good to
[SPEAKER_04]: be true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all think we're insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, oh my God, they're wearing
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're eating it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a friend who actually took the old
decor decater recipes from, I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: the plans from back in the thirties and
has now made his own decor decater here in
[SPEAKER_12]: America and is now working on cellulastic
plastic.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to investigate possibly
making these lids that we put on our
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's going to start looking at making them
from plastic from hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shelled hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can start with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got a food product and then you
need hemp toilet paper so you can get rid
[SPEAKER_04]: of your food product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause cutting down ancient trees to wipe
shit off your a-hole.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the really most sustainable,
great idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I don't know who came up with that
idea, but I suspect it was under the
[SPEAKER_09]: influence of like alcohol or some other
shitty drug.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_12]: You mean the caveman didn't have Scott's
toilet tissue?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dude, listen, I've had the best
argument I ever had was in Thailand when
[SPEAKER_09]: my friend's wife was arguing with this
other girl about, you know, the North
[SPEAKER_09]: American girl was like, oh, how do you
guys not use toilet paper?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Thai girl was like,
you guys don't wash with water.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're disgusting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the end of the argument was,
would you just wipe shit off your arm if
[SPEAKER_09]: it got on your arm or would you use some
water?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think mama bears teach their baby cubs
to lick it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not licking it off, but we're a
strange bunch.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we need to restart the world bidet
program and get bidets out there again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just use the toilet in Goa where a pig
will sniff up your butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The truffle pig.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk about service with a smile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'll stick with the bidet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need that bacon.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bacon day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the middle East, everybody just wipes
with their left hand.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no shaking with your left hand.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no toilet paper, just a hole in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody who's a thief, what they do is
they cut off their left hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to wipe with their right
hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody will shake their right hand if they
only have a right hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Careful on shaking with the left hand in
parts of Asia.
[SPEAKER_12]: Literally hands down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it just goes deep.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes deep here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes deep in Beaver Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is new in the wonderful world of
cannabis here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we got an attempt from Dr. Natasha.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Natasha is in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's been a couple of weeks since
we saw you.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's fine doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been taking my Sundays to have
some relaxation time the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting some forest time in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always essential.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is very nice and we're fortunate
here in Vancouver we have access to some
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing forests with really amazing trees
that are so big and just really you feel
[SPEAKER_06]: like you're standing by something just
like another being.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never felt like that around trees
necessarily before but when you're walking
[SPEAKER_06]: through these old growth forests here it's
just really you feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have sequoias up there or are they
just redwoods?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have sequoias.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not actually sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know my trees very well but.
[SPEAKER_09]: My neighbor planted a sequoia in her front
yard 35 years ago and you should see this
[SPEAKER_09]: tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do the sequoias look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which are the sequoias?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're the biggest trees on
earth.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're large redwoods I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a large stem but they have a
very shallow root system so they tend to
[SPEAKER_12]: grow in groups otherwise they can tend to
fall over in storms.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's similar to the big Douglas firs
that you're seeing in our forests when you
[SPEAKER_09]: know those huge trunks with the agaricons
and the red belts that grow around their
[SPEAKER_09]: bases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the systems you see with these big
trees are also outstanding and the
[SPEAKER_06]: different colors and I mean you're seeing
blues and different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you're also dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen sequoias big enough that you
could drive a 16 wheeler through it
[SPEAKER_04]: sideways without being taller than the
sequoia was wide.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a red belted one, two or three
that I photographed.
[SPEAKER_09]: My son's school in my neighborhood here
has an old growth forest for the school
[SPEAKER_09]: ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just in the forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's trails.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes over creeks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally huge and they just release
like four to seven year old kids into this
[SPEAKER_09]: forest every day and it's a pretty cool
school ground I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_04]: To tell you the truth, we don't own these
old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hold them in stewardship for the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should save them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should all be saved.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a biodiversity in them that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was in West Virginia, there's
virgin hemlock forests not too far outside
[SPEAKER_12]: of town and it's a little trek to get
there but when you get in those old growth
[SPEAKER_12]: forests, everything around you from the
ground to the canopy is so unique compared
[SPEAKER_12]: to other forests that you're in because
that biodiversity has been left intact as
[SPEAKER_12]: opposed to destroyed temporarily and never
rebuilt through logging.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an amazing thing that if you're
around and you have access to go to a
[SPEAKER_12]: virgin forest somewhere around in your
state or province, I highly recommend if
[SPEAKER_12]: you've never been, go in, sit down and
just look.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, another one that you might want to
check out, Natasha, is I could take you
[SPEAKER_09]: and David up there one day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just north of Whistler on Cougar
Mountain and there is an ancient cedar
[SPEAKER_09]: forest there and the trees there are
bigger than any of the ones that you've
[SPEAKER_09]: probably seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you've gone to Vancouver Island to
specific areas like north of Tofino,
[SPEAKER_09]: Strawberry Island, Mirror Island,
you won't have seen trees this big.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not as big as the Cali ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could pretty much almost drive a car
through these ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're about 14 to 15 feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: You pull up to them on a dirt bike and you
just feel like a little peanut.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be amazing to check that
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the biggest tree place that I went
to check out was on Vancouver Island near
[SPEAKER_06]: Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember exactly where it was but
it was about an hour outside of Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to some forest that was a
preserved area with some special sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing a horrible job explaining this
but I remember we went there specifically
[SPEAKER_06]: for the trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily want to just walk
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go and sit with the tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the type of person where I really
feel vibes or those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand other people do feel that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my general life, I don't say I'm super
connected to feeling my surroundings.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I'm around trees like that,
it's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really makes me want to just sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to ones that are really old and have
fallen, they've cut through the entire
[SPEAKER_04]: trunk so that you could see the rings
shown on the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where Christ was born and before.
[SPEAKER_09]: For people that want to check out photos
of what Natasha was talking about,
[SPEAKER_09]: if she was in Nanaimo looking at ancient
trees, it would have been in Macmillan
[SPEAKER_09]: Provincial Park and it would have been
Cathedral Grove, which is right off the
[SPEAKER_09]: highway in between Victoria and Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are spectacular trees there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you the ancient cedar forest
north of Whistler.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The sound is insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quieter.
[SPEAKER_09]: When the trees are that much bigger,
it's even quieter in the forest if that's
[SPEAKER_09]: somehow possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally feel you.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you're saying, the place we were was by
a highway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't feel like we were deep in the
forest when we were seeing the trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like we were doing more of a
tourist drive through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to check out the area you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the more secluded forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one will take you 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: or to an hour just to hike up the mountain
to get to the area.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cheat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take my dirt bike up there, but we can
walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the journey to get to the site.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always feels better when you get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you've earned it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I heard you were talking about
forests, so I thought I'd pop it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We literally are talking about trees and
forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know, but you copyrighted it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like if Chimera was here,
he would have already told us about the
[SPEAKER_09]: importance of the terpene pining inside
the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pining is the most common terpene in the
world, primarily from forest.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's that fresh forest smell that you
inhale.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is literally part of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, we've all been hearing about the
forest therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been getting more press lately,
but they actually have areas of forest
[SPEAKER_06]: that's preserved and kept specifically for
forest therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some clinical work where they've
taken groups of teenage boys who were
[SPEAKER_06]: troubled youth or having just behavioral
issues, and then they take them on these
[SPEAKER_06]: either day long or weekend, basically
forest hikes, and they spend time in the
[SPEAKER_06]: woods.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're finding that their behavior
improves, their immune profile improves,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they've done some blood markers,
like stress hormones and some inflammatory
[SPEAKER_06]: immune markers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some pretty interesting even
clinical work, and then they're bringing
[SPEAKER_06]: it back to what could be physiologically
responsible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alpha pining is one of the main mechanisms
of how forests, when you spend time in the
[SPEAKER_06]: trees, you actually are breathing in that
monoterpene and getting it into your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look at the microbes that you're
experiencing when you're the bacteria and
[SPEAKER_06]: the fungi pop elations that you're
experiencing when you're in the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even some studies done with mice
where they spend time in certain dirt
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria, and they find that their mood
improves, and it's affecting their
[SPEAKER_06]: serotonin pathways.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's just the alpha pining.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also, obviously, like Marcus,
what you were saying, the sound,
[SPEAKER_06]: that meditative aspect of just being even
the sensory deprivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking all around you,
and all you see is green trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very soothing and good for your
stress response.
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when you gave a perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not the type of person to be super
feely about vibes and energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got more of a scientist mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going into data.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like an analytical mind,
but the forest is powerful enough to break
[SPEAKER_09]: through to many, many different types.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see people all the time who are maybe
not necessarily going to be going to a
[SPEAKER_09]: rainbow gathering anytime soon and feeling
the love of the whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you go into the forest, and you really
see everyday people, people that might not
[SPEAKER_09]: be as connected to their plants,
say, at their house or something on an
[SPEAKER_09]: everyday basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they get into that forest,
and especially an ancient, beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: sequoias and Douglas firs and cedars.
[SPEAKER_09]: These trees are spectacular, and they are
a huge part of our ecosystem, as we see,
[SPEAKER_09]: because when we cut them down,
the destruction is obvious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even to the most blinded people,
you see that it's destruction.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, wow, when you destroy a forest and
you're just left with land, it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_09]: D420k's in the forest, although we just
shut off and went to his classic photo of
[SPEAKER_09]: him on his riding lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_09]: How fucking redneck is that, though,
honestly?
[SPEAKER_09]: D420k's photo of him on his lawnmower is
like, I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you mean Rouge neck?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you see me?
[SPEAKER_09]: We can see you and hear you, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're in the forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about the forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forest came in with the name Forest,
and we were like, how's anyone going to
[SPEAKER_09]: want to?
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I can see the forest from the
trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you're in the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy it while you can, because pretty
soon, all combustion engines are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be banned worldwide for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pedal around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're actually passing
anti-combustion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Laws in India by 2040 and other countries,
so they're ramping up to already throw
[SPEAKER_12]: away fossil fuels forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas America, we still got our heads so
far up our ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need an electric snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need an electric snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need an electric dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need an electric boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to need an electric truck.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, an actual competing company just
came out competing against Tesla with the
[SPEAKER_12]: first electric trunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cumans, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Competing against Tesla with their patents
given to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tesla gave all those patents away to those
companies so they could compete.
[SPEAKER_09]: How fucking cool was that?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a stroke of genius for the entire...
It's a way to drive the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish more people had that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What a brilliant... The guy's got some of
the most valuable patents legitimately on
[SPEAKER_09]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to be in the top 10%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ridiculous money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he gives them away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gives them away to all of his competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just put it on the internet for
whoever wants, but he actually sent it to
[SPEAKER_12]: car companies.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you saw he just bought his cousin's
company, the solar company, for two
[SPEAKER_12]: billion cash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to hook up your cousin with two
billion cash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now he's got solar roofs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's got solar roofs for your solar
house with this storage capacity from your
[SPEAKER_12]: portable all the way up to large
municipality cities.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you can power your car.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, guys, it's beyond futuristic.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's sending rockets to and from
space, and they're coming back and landing
[SPEAKER_12]: in the middle of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That shit blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched that shit with my kid,
and I can honestly say there's only a few
[SPEAKER_09]: times in life where you feel there's some
world history going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like when they land on the moon,
there's like certain things.
[SPEAKER_09]: When NASA sends a rocket off, it can be
fairly historical.
[SPEAKER_09]: And NASA said it was impossible that you
couldn't send that rockets up into space
[SPEAKER_09]: and then have them come back down and land
on a platform, particularly on the ocean,
[SPEAKER_09]: a moving platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like electrical, but there's still a
couple of things that kind of bug me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is how far can you go on a
single charge?
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two is how long does it take to
recharge?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, those things are... Number
three, where do the electrons come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: The electrons probably come from a fossil
fuel burning plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a third reason that's really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the electron economy, where do the
electrons come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: From coal or nuclear power plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely using a lot of it to
get the material to get those batteries
[SPEAKER_09]: built.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using a lot of petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find those other companies were
also using petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using petrochemicals merely to
create products that use petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to cut off one sort of head,
I think, is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully, eventually, they'll stop
using the petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: With production, you'll have also people
looking for alternatives the way that they
[SPEAKER_12]: do all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping for hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds really good to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds clean as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, the cost of all alternative
energy is directly tied to the price of
[SPEAKER_08]: fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which are subsidized and are being,
you know, falsely held up where they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this era of cheap fossil fuels,
which it's just, yeah, again... More so
[SPEAKER_09]: than being tied to fossil fuels,
what it's really tied to is human labor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because human labor is what does
everything, regardless of the illusion of
[SPEAKER_09]: money or the actual reality of fossil
fuels versus electric.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's human labor that makes the world go
round.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why money was created.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people could say, oh, I'm going to do
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without cheap fossil fuels, there wouldn't
be the food production distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption system that exists in America
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wouldn't be Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: There wouldn't be a different one.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole commerce is predicated on cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything would be local.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And money would be printed differently,
you know, because when I hear people say,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, it's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, money is a mental construct that we
made up, that we just print as much of it
[SPEAKER_09]: as we want.
[SPEAKER_09]: But labor is real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Labor is the real thing that actually gets
things done.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't extract things out of the earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't grow food.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't move things.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do anything with labor.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the real value in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not money, not fossil fuels, not any of
this other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's labor.
[SPEAKER_09]: People doing shit for people.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost sound like a slave owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can assure you that I own no
slaves other than myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a slave to my own to my own job.
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you for calling me a slave
owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you respond to that?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it was anyone else, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with Skunkman Sam, you just laugh.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like he definitely doesn't mean harm.
[SPEAKER_09]: He definitely is not being malicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like he's like Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll say anything for a laugh.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're not going to secede.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there we go.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know what my jokes have to be
explained.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't be that funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you explain that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is crazy, though, that we haven't had a
bong rip yet since D420K got into the
[SPEAKER_09]: room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had a few.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're slacking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am totally slacking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he's on the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what has real value in the world
is creativity and inventiveness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you need labor to manifest it,
but it's the inventiveness and
[SPEAKER_04]: creativeness that's the biggest donation
that's being given to humanity by really
[SPEAKER_04]: bright people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I call it the 1% inspiration, 99%
perspiration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get people all the time hitting me up
and saying, I got a great idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give it to you, but I want
50%.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be like, listen, your great idea
is worth 1%.
[SPEAKER_09]: The execution of said great idea is worth
99%.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was sort of a thing my grandpa
told me years ago, that it's 99%
[SPEAKER_09]: perspiration and it's 1% inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to always say that if ideas were
what was really, really important,
[SPEAKER_04]: then the wealthiest people on the planet
would be the Rainbow Tribe.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rainbow Tribe, are they still around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're following fish.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're following fish.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought they were a rainbow family.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're following the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you dated yourself before,
Marcus, when you said rainbow gathering.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't heard the rainbow gathering for a
while.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that thing still exist?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely not on fish tour,
I'll tell you that much because Mark would
[SPEAKER_09]: know if they existed if they were on fish
tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the people on fish tour is the 12
tribes bus, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That dark red maroon looking bus that
serves cookies and wants you to come
[SPEAKER_08]: inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the same family that is kind of
pseudo weird religious and you're allowed
[SPEAKER_09]: to have only one length of ponytail and a
big beard?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that those guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, don't get on the bus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me, listen, they owned a bakery in
my city.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are the ones that owned a
bakery.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me, it's them, 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to just call themselves the
family.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was their bakery's name?
[SPEAKER_09]: They made killer, killer baked goods.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd go and hang out and they'd be like,
oh, you should come by and hang out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had really long hair at the time and the
guy was like, you should really cut your
[SPEAKER_09]: ponytail.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too long.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very egocentric when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You grow your ponytail longer than one
hand length.
[SPEAKER_09]: He started telling me about his weird
dogmas and I was just like, all right,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever, I'll hang out and listen to
this, eat a really good organic vegan meal
[SPEAKER_09]: at their cafe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they were like, yeah, come by and we
like to sing and play music and dance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, yeah, I'll come check it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came and check it out and all the chicks
were wearing weird little house on the
[SPEAKER_09]: prairie dresses, all the same dress that
went up to here with the weird little
[SPEAKER_09]: sorta.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just got weirder and weirder and
weirder.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was into weird, so it wasn't like I
wanted to do it, but I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just like trip out on this and with
my buddies and experience this moment,
[SPEAKER_09]: not laughing at them, not mocking at them,
not thinking I'm better than them in any
[SPEAKER_09]: way, shape or form, just like I trip on
human belief systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got Hasidic Jewish friends from
Brooklyn and I trip on their belief
[SPEAKER_09]: systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got raw foodist friends from
Switzerland and I trip on their belief.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just neat how fervent we get in our
belief systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have the right to believe what we
want and then we have the right to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it and giggle sometimes with some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fish song, Birds of a Feather,
I think was written about those folks
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark might know the band well enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the birds of a feather are flocking
outside and perhaps you'll receive
[SPEAKER_02]: invitations from people trying to get
people into the porch lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's about those fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to drag them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a nitrous balloon in one hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to drag them into the bus
for tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with people
believing in any belief system that they
[SPEAKER_04]: like as long as they're not enforcing it
on others and saying, well, if you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: do it, then you're obviously going to burn
in purgatory forever because you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: heathen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question for everyone on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the strangest thing that you have
ever smoked cannabis out of?
[SPEAKER_09]: I will start and I would think that it
would probably have been Darren from BC.
[SPEAKER_09]: He won the cannabis cup in like 96 or 97
when the big BC contingent came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had the long curly hair and he had a
broccoli pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had smoked out of a carrot and a
zucchini and an apple.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had smoked out of quite a few different
fruits and shit, but when he pulled out
[SPEAKER_09]: the broccoli pipe with the full head still
on it, with the bowl right in the broccoli
[SPEAKER_09]: head, I was like, all right, dude,
and a thick stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: It had almost as thick as my wrist,
broccoli stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was probably the weirdest thing I
have smoked out of.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, everyone's too afraid.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was really young, we rolled a joint
out of a woman's tampon paper,
[SPEAKER_08]: the paper that the tampon came and looked
like rolling paper to us or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, all right, Mark wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go next page out of the Bible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that one, the page out of the
Bible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might even been there for one of the
page out of the Bibles, but a tampon
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it before or after?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go for before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was no, it was, it was not used.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a human bone pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me, Sam?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he doesn't clown around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a human, but where did you get
that?
[SPEAKER_09]: In India or something?
[SPEAKER_12]: In Tibet.
Tibet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They sell, you remember they have the,
the necklace with all the knuckles from
[SPEAKER_12]: the monks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Sam wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, uh, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never smoked out of a human except
when, when they blow into my mouth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine was the least weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, my, mine isn't that weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine was just this, uh, this pipe at a
party I was at in Berkeley and,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, you, you, you hit the bong,
this bong, and then it had a release valve
[SPEAKER_12]: that shot a whip it right behind the smoke
and shot it straight into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was probably the strange,
most unique pipe that I've ever hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I would love next time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And next time I see you, Sam, I want to
hit that pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a nitrous oxide, uh, gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've hit the nitrous oxide gravity bong,
not really a gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was more like a nitrous oxide,
like a balloon that just pushed through.
[SPEAKER_09]: You fill the bong with a rip and then you
just release this little valve that he had
[SPEAKER_09]: and it blew the nitrous and the rip into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, I wasn't a fan of it at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like those kinds of alcohol type.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, it was unique, but, uh, okay,
come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rest of the panelists this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Rise would have, uh, you're just very
vanilla and you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_12]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think I could beat any of the
ones you guys have brought up.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about an earth pipe?
[SPEAKER_09]: You seem like an earth pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Girl, you and David have never made an
earth pipe and puffed right out of mother
[SPEAKER_09]: earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is an earth pipe?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you just, you can make a bowl and a
stem and you, the, the, the pipe is the
[SPEAKER_09]: earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just dig a hole and you bury the stem
and you create a little pocket and you can
[SPEAKER_09]: puff out of the Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cloak.
[SPEAKER_09]: He did a whole crazy video of like making
everything into pipes in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: He, he drilled out benches and trees and
like signs and then did a whole video on
[SPEAKER_09]: it where he just walked around.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be sitting on a bench and then the
next thing you know, he'd be like on
[SPEAKER_09]: beside the bench, stuffing it full of
weed, puffing out of a park bench,
[SPEAKER_09]: puffing out of trees, puffing out of like
a lot of strange things, things that watch
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You wouldn't puff out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you done an earth hit with a solar,
you know, that's the no, but I have done
[SPEAKER_09]: solar bowls, but I've never done a solar
earth bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: I on a windy beach, a solar bowl is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Solar bowls are awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like going blind because it's great
because you're staring at this ball of
[SPEAKER_09]: sunlight in your pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: You wear sunglasses, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even with sunglasses, you got to wear
like, it's like a solar eclipse in your
[SPEAKER_09]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I ever hit a solar,
like trying not to look, but every time,
[SPEAKER_09]: cause I also, my solar bowls were majority
not bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were full melt bubble and with solar
bowl with full melt bubble, the bubble
[SPEAKER_09]: melts and moves away from the heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to watch it and move it
around.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else with some weird pipes that
they've forest anything?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I mean, when I was,
most of them were probably when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more white trashy than interesting
or cool, but I'm sure there was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: found recycled can pipe at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the master of those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some sort of trailer park,
MacGyver is sort of nuts and bolts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Swim at a quarry where they hit water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like a really common up in New
England and in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like you'd be basically at a
construction site that would suddenly just
[SPEAKER_08]: hit water and it would completely fill up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's a lot of these swimming
quarries up in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one in Dorset, Vermont actually
has a bowl carved into the side of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cliff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually go there and hang out and
go diving and whatnot into the quarry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a bowl carved into the side of
the cliff that you could just kind of come
[SPEAKER_08]: up and use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that we've smoked out of the Dorset
quarry bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that concept.
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems like a concept that is
thousands of years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: The concept of creating a pipe to leave
somewhere and smoke out of like when you
[SPEAKER_08]: that's carved right into the cliff side
that you could come right up and use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the original one actually someone
had actually broken it off because it was
[SPEAKER_08]: much smaller.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we went back years later,
I think it was on Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say in the late 80s,
we went there swimming one day in between
[SPEAKER_08]: shows.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I went to use the bowl and
noticed that it was it was a different
[SPEAKER_08]: bowl that and it would been replaced by a
much larger one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is in a place called Dorset,
Vermont, right off of Route 7 in Dorset.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marble quarry where they hit water and a
lot of people go swim in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool to have a little bowl built
into the cliff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why God made papayas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Papaya branches are natural for filling up
with herb or hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work really, truly great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a hundred year old chilum that
I collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made out of either iron or steel or
I'm not exactly sure the metal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's maybe a hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason Sadu's like this was
because they could hang it on a string and
[SPEAKER_04]: they wouldn't break it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird, crazy, wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome, Peter.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just talking about crazy,
whacked out pipes that we've smoked out
[SPEAKER_09]: of.
[SPEAKER_09]: My pipe was the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark Scaldone rolled a joint in a tampon
paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: D420K used the Bible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam uses a human bone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sam uses a human bone pipe that's
literally on his thing right now with the
[SPEAKER_09]: hundred year old chilum.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a human bone pipe from the first
person he ever killed, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it's from Tibet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was already completely stained.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it have any flesh left on it?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was old, like maybe 50 or 100 years old
when I got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the zombie apocalypse comes,
Sam's pipe is going to wake up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So be on the lookout there, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Human stone, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the Nagas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you ever hang out with Naga Sadus?
[SPEAKER_04]: In Tibet, you also see they use just the
very top part of the skull as a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the Nagas, well, not all of
them, but a few that I met had that little
[SPEAKER_09]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: They eat the food out of, they drink out
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I was like, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like about as heavy as the belief
system got while I was in, although I
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't see a guy get murdered at the Maha
Kumbh Mela because he went into the gaps
[SPEAKER_09]: before the Naga Sadus.
[SPEAKER_09]: He thought he would go bathe before them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the guy just picked up a big spear and
stabbed him right in the side.
[SPEAKER_09]: And nobody did anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just floated down the river.
[SPEAKER_09]: No army, no military.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he had a blessed death.
[SPEAKER_09]: He died in the holy river.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's what people were telling me
later.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, this is fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wo ye of little belief.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a visitor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I felt like I was in the Star Wars set,
Tatooine or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit was next level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Belief system is wild, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen mobs go after drivers of
automobiles that killed cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody says, if you're out in the
villages, don't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if you hit a cow, you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take it very personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were caves in Nepal that cows were
allowed in, but Mark Rose
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: All through the unique belief system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mine is not smoking, but I've recently
started eating cannabis flowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: putting them in my lip between my gum and
my cheek and sucking on it for half hour
[SPEAKER_05]: to an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get a really nice sense of how
those flowers were finished and a really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice buzz off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try it sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peppery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not smoking, but it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're eating THCA and getting the nice
buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm enjoying the flavor and a physical
experience more than a psychoactive buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different buzz.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, when I ate dried but still in the THC
form buds, I did feel a tiny bit of an
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I take that same bud and I
decarboxylate it and then eat it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I get whacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's more than just,
you're going to have some breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_02]: acidic THCA to THC in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get some, but,
you know, we're learning that some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these effects, you know, we could be
feeling the chirping profiles as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could have something to do with
it, depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is True Subcoolz in the house,
driving as always, probably going to the
[SPEAKER_09]: garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I muted you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had your music on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I'm always worried about any
outside music in YouTube, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like three seconds and they cut your
show off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means if I sing a song,
they're going to ban it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't sing a song, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only Mark's allowed to sing songs on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Know your place.
[SPEAKER_09]: What everyone needs to do is know their
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually today I'm going to be the
bacteria guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Natasha is going to be the hash girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade, Wade's going to be running the BPG
D420K while you are Skunkman Sam today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just all be each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do I get?
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do I get to be?
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to be, dude, you can be Todd
McCormick.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's got to represent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be Joe Petrie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Petrie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm headed to North Star Genetics to pick
up some deadlights this morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just had me some eggs, Benedict.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yum.
Yum.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you're just on the highway.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a wake and bake recently where I was
in my truck the whole time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of lame because I didn't have
a wake and bake with this, but it was
[SPEAKER_09]: still neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think we'd get higher ratings?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not down with the drama higher
ratings.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather just have whoever wants to
listen can listen and if it's good
[SPEAKER_09]: information, excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not going to have Sub kill
himself for some half a year trading.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash Church, not Crash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sub's already been through some shit
as we all have, but maybe Sub's been
[SPEAKER_09]: through a little bit more than most.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been through a few.
[SPEAKER_09]: Live car accident on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they have them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Russian car dash cams.
[SPEAKER_09]: Russian dash cams.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the worst YouTube channel ever
to watch.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the craziest shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there is just out of left field
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, what the... Watching those
videos is definitely... Don't you find
[SPEAKER_09]: Italians drive faster?
[SPEAKER_09]: Italians?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Italians drive faster and crazier
and more dangerously, but the Russians are
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Italians don't have to, by law,
have a dash camera in their car.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the Russians do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get to... Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get to register your car without
those dash cameras.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why there's so many.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every accident is recorded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say that in Switzerland,
at least, in the South, the Italian sort
[SPEAKER_09]: of Swiss Italian are driving as crazy and
fast as in the North, the German Swiss.
[SPEAKER_09]: They drive fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in Germany, once you're 30
kilometers outside of a city, then there
[SPEAKER_04]: are no speed limits on the highways.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely... As long as there's three
lanes and it's 30 kilometers out of a city
[SPEAKER_04]: center.
[SPEAKER_09]: And stay out of the far left lane unless
you're literally in a $200,000 car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, man... No, no, it doesn't take...
It just takes 200 kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but man, some of those cars are
going way faster than 200 kilometers an
[SPEAKER_09]: hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you see them in your rear view
mirror and they're super far away and then
[SPEAKER_09]: you look down and you look back up and
they are like literally... All new.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to drive Gypsy Nirvana's brand new
whatever Jaguar he bought that was like
[SPEAKER_09]: 115,000 euros back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove that thing like 250K on the German
Autobahn there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was as we were driving down to
Switzerland together.
[SPEAKER_04]: On long trips, I prefer higher speeds as
long as it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I drive a Bugatti except that you
have to put gas in it every half an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to get one of those electric
Bugattis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen one?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: That car is like 1200 horsepower or
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I wouldn't be surprised if a
Tesla P100S could still take it off the
[SPEAKER_09]: line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to admit it would be fun to
drive one time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just beat a Lamborghini the other day
by like a half second, but it's still over
[SPEAKER_12]: a mile.
[SPEAKER_12]: It beats everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen anything beat it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And somebody got 664 kilometers in Europe
on Monday.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one charge the other day off of a PS
100.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once they break a thousand, that's... I
mean, how many freaking kilometers can you
[SPEAKER_09]: drive in a day?
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going on in Peter's world?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us what's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's new and different, Peter?
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well, we just... I was listening to
some amazing stuff that you were blowing
[SPEAKER_11]: my fucking mind with earlier, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had to jump in.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were talking about like...
[SPEAKER_11]: I think sustainable eco villages are like,
you know, the rockets blasting and all
[SPEAKER_11]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I got to come see what
Marcus is, what's going on in his mind,
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we were talking about Elon Musk and
sort of, you know, a lot of his projects
[SPEAKER_09]: that he's working on and whatnot with
the... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got like three huge projects going on
at any given time.
[SPEAKER_09]: The solar panels, the electric vehicles
and the SpaceX program.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been thinking a lot about water
conservation in eco villages, like these
[SPEAKER_11]: sustainable communities, because we can
get... Well, because I'm a soil nerd,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of what goes on in my mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we could get soil to a point of
competency where, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_11]: super good, rich, dark soil, you know,
full of humus in these eco villages,
[SPEAKER_11]: you could actually like filter the water
and allow it to purify through the
[SPEAKER_11]: biology.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the minerals and just have a
really cool system in a super healthy,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, sustainable eco village.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the things I've been
thinking about lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a nature septic field.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a nature septic field.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, let the water percolate through
the soil and then almost get caught in
[SPEAKER_11]: like a funnel where you could recirculate
that and allow it to go back into the
[SPEAKER_11]: plumbing and just keep using the water.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a natural, really good carbon
filter, like the best carbon filter that
[SPEAKER_11]: you can have with nutrients and the
correct beneficial bacteria that the soil
[SPEAKER_11]: provides the plants, which the plants
provide us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's part of what it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's part of its design.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's fucking nature,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds almost like you're talking about
aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a fair...
[SPEAKER_05]: description of what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you're circulating water to plant
materials and fish are there, waste
[SPEAKER_05]: products are feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then any time you can circulate the
water back to the fish and or into your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But on a larger scale, kind of like for
humans.
[SPEAKER_09]: The human version.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when Breeder Steve first
started, he did aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had those little mouth breeder fish.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember the name of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what the heck were those ones called?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, aquaponics is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the crazy thing was he could get a lot
of growth out of it, but you could also
[SPEAKER_09]: get like the same way you could get like
five to 10 days of beautiful growth,
[SPEAKER_09]: like in a very short period of time,
like 24 to 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could kill your whole crop like
equally as fast, like just decimate it,
[SPEAKER_09]: like so dead, like it's not coming back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once the... It's like a macro sweet spot
in the sense if anyone understands macro
[SPEAKER_09]: photography, when you shoot macro
photography, your depth of field
[SPEAKER_09]: disappears and you get this like band that
is like nine or eight or seven millimeters
[SPEAKER_09]: wide.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's your area that you have to
shoot that'll be clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything else will be out of focus ahead
of it and behind it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the sweet spot, if you will,
is very, very, very, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're not on it, it becomes obvious
right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: So subs agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Long awkward silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the other thing that was, that's pretty
new in our world with our biology,
[SPEAKER_11]: is that we just got some preliminary data
in from one of our hemp cultivators and
[SPEAKER_11]: they've been testing CBD levels for the
last six years.
[SPEAKER_11]: They spent about $45,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a big operation on CBD and THC
potency analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously they don't want the THC to get
too high because if it does, then the crop
[SPEAKER_11]: is illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if it goes hot for these hemp
growers, big deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they come in and they burn their
whole crop.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so anyways, they've been doing a lot
of analysis on these different CBD levels,
[SPEAKER_11]: which I'm not too familiar with yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still learning a lot about the CBD
levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they said that in analyzing hundreds
of plants over the last six years,
[SPEAKER_11]: weekly is how they do their analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said that our product on the bell
curve over the last six years is 30%
[SPEAKER_11]: higher in CBD oil production than the
non-treated.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they said that was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They also said that the type of CBD was
really good quality of CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if there's different,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's CBD A and there's CBD V A.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if it was a different... Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's a better one.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways,
[SPEAKER_11]: in our treated plants than the non-treated
over the last six years of the bell curve.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're obviously happy with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're obviously happy with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was in the first two weeks of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now what they're saying is that if this
keeps trending on the progression that
[SPEAKER_11]: they're used to seeing on their analysis,
that it could go up as much as 50 or 60%
[SPEAKER_11]: in the oil production.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just from increasing the biology
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the guy is a PhD, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like, I thought my fucking
instruments were broken, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: He goes, this is something that I've never
seen before in five generations of
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that's proof that we're on
the right track.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if the labs never see anything
new, then we're not innovating and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: not changing anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the brilliant people that are
involved in all of this stuff are doing
[SPEAKER_09]: shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense that we're going to hear
labs say things like, I've never,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, like the first time I ever heard
it was when I gave Indra's oil to the labs
[SPEAKER_09]: here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of them said that they had never seen
numbers that high, that they had never
[SPEAKER_09]: tested protein powder.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had never isolated that high.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had never seen oil content that clean
and that high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's good because if we're
not hearing that, then we're not all doing
[SPEAKER_09]: a very good job in the world of innovation
and, you know, pushing this stuff forward
[SPEAKER_09]: and making.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the CBD levels are increasing,
what about the THC levels?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they increasing also?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the THC levels went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unusual.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was unusual.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said the THC levels were down in
contrast to the to the other ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our THC was down in hemp plants in
these particular.
[SPEAKER_09]: What were the hemp plant cultivars?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're ones that they've been growing
for the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_11]: The CBD went up and they were like,
they were like broken.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, we thought our instruments were
broken because it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was zero.
[SPEAKER_11]: The THC was zero.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were like, so we kept doing new
instruments, but the THC was like zero to
[SPEAKER_11]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that does not surprise me at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm a firm believer in your kind
of growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but what does surprise me is that the
CBD would go up and the THC would go down
[SPEAKER_04]: in the same crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's that it doesn't follow
logical sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it have anything to do with the fact
that the cultivar was being bred to
[SPEAKER_09]: produce CBD and to produce less THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it or was it just a hemp variety?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is for industrial hemp operation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But weren't hemp varieties inevitably when
you get rid of one cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_09]: another takes its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are they not bred for hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only one or two percent CBD,
but there are CBD varieties which are over
[SPEAKER_04]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are bred for CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you got to think of this guy's
growing for CBD and he's got a PhD and
[SPEAKER_09]: he's got a big operation and he knows that
if he grows cultivars that are bred for
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD, it's going to make a lot more sense
for his business than to grow like hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: plants that are two percent CBD,
no?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the only way you could do that
would be by analyzing huge, huge numbers
[SPEAKER_04]: of plants and eliminating any that had THC
levels that were too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be done, but it would be... Well,
that's what the Ukrainians did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Goroborodko and... Right,
but the people here are not doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a simple method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what his goal is too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is his goal to produce CBD or are
they producing fibers and other byproducts
[SPEAKER_02]: of the hemp plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD is a nice afterthought.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no infrastructure for... There's
no monetary gain for fiber for hemp,
[SPEAKER_09]: no?
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very few people on the planet are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The value is in the seed oil and in the
cannabinoids and the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_09]: period, right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they were doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_11]: They sell to multitudes of hospitals
internationally.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're growing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would make sense that they're
probably CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to plant hemp cultivars that are
like 2% CBD over ones that are five times
[SPEAKER_09]: higher.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the plant... Here's what my
thought... Not five times, 10 times
[SPEAKER_09]: higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, up to 10 times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plants are meant to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: If a strain of plant is meant to produce
high CBD and low THC, then wouldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: increasing its true genetic expression in
those derivatives directions kind of make
[SPEAKER_11]: sense to you guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my kind of question too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if it was just a hemp for... If THC
had been bred out of it and that was the
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of what was going on in that
cultivar, maybe the bacteria somehow
[SPEAKER_09]: influenced that same pathway rather than
raising all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know enough about it, but there is
someone in the room asking if you are
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about Davis herb farms,
extreme scale performances, shooting a
[SPEAKER_09]: documentary on their story right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I'll check that out for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually if you're increasing the flowers,
the resin, the terpenes, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's across the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just particular cannabinoids or
particular terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's whatever the plant normally
expresses, but to a slightly higher
[SPEAKER_04]: degree.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a slight higher degree with the
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to jump in with an observation.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I've found, I've not
done nearly as much testing as the folks
[SPEAKER_05]: you're describing, Peter, but I have found
that depending on when you harvest some
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD rich cultivars, you can change the
proportion of CBD to THC pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be that in addition to soil
biology contributing to the wellness of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants and their opportunity to
express their genetic potential,
[SPEAKER_05]: the other thing that might be going on,
and you said they were testing every week,
[SPEAKER_05]: what you'll see is that CBD tends to come
on before THC in the genetic expression of
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant, the biosynthetic process,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen pretty dramatic differences in
the ratios that are in finished flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on when you harvest them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The later they go in their cycle,
the THC tends to increase and CBD tends to
[SPEAKER_05]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, you've probably seen the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear what you have to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen varieties that did that,
and I've seen varieties that did the
[SPEAKER_04]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's any fixed
situation.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask a question about just following
up on what you were just saying there?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were growing a cultivar of cannabis
and say it was a nine week flower growing
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and you ended it at eight weeks,
how much of that final cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_06]: development are you losing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it 5%?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it 20%?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is happening in those final weeks
of development?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Different varieties, it really depends on
the variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some varieties really frost up the last
two, three, four weeks, so you don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to take the plant before it's done
frosting up, unless you're after a more
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe terpene rich, because the longer you
let it flower, then you're probably
[SPEAKER_04]: decreasing the terpenes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing some tours over the last
few weeks of some of the different
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed producers here in Canada and
checking out their grow rooms and stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: which has been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just hearing some of the logistics of how
people are setting up their grow and how
[SPEAKER_06]: many grow cycles they're anticipating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just interesting hearing the
differences between groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some groups are thinking eight weeks is
going to be consistent and we'll just be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to turn over the room after every
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then my husband, as a grower, is asking
those questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about, because some of the cultivars
he's growing that he was expecting to be
[SPEAKER_06]: done in eight weeks, he's finding the
longer he leaves them, obviously they're
[SPEAKER_06]: frosting up more.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been just thinking of those
questions of what's that- I've got
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that take 24 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do it faster, you're not creating
the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them.
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my personal favorite, I have a
real affinity for exotic, tropical grown,
[SPEAKER_09]: narrow leaf drug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what he's talking about,
100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: The terpene profiles- They have different,
unique terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're almost gone, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can imagine Prohibition,
and that's why they're gone, because of
[SPEAKER_09]: Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I see something like Prohibition
taking a stab at exotic, long flowering,
[SPEAKER_09]: tropical grown, narrow leaf drug
cultivars, I think there's got to be a
[SPEAKER_09]: serious value there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I start looking into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first long flower- They cannot compete
indoors under lights on a projection per
[SPEAKER_04]: gram per hour basis, but a big giant
greenhouse or outdoors, or you live far
[SPEAKER_04]: enough south, then- I grew them indoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew 16 and 20 weakers indoors,
and man, people thought I was nuts,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I'll tell you, the same thing happened
every single time when it was time to
[SPEAKER_09]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you they wanted to smoke your herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh God, did they want to smoke my herb,
dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: The haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we called it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all about the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it was the terpene profile that
was modulating the cannabinoids so
[SPEAKER_09]: uniquely and differently, causing anxiety
attacks in some people, but for me,
[SPEAKER_09]: just the most blissful experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: My mind was sharp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was inspired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't lazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to create.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to innovate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to- I just love the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was it a hy- Was it prionine and
limonine that were bringing that,
[SPEAKER_09]: or was it more- We got to test the
terpenes back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I suspect terpenylene had a lot to do with
it as now.
[SPEAKER_09]: The more I learn about these different
terpenes, it's one of my favorites for
[SPEAKER_09]: sure, but it's a combination, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole slew of them in there,
and I wouldn't be surprised if in those
[SPEAKER_09]: exotic, narrow leaf drug cultivars,
if you actually tested for how many there
[SPEAKER_09]: were, you would find so many more than 12
or 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're different terpenes in different
ratios than you find in wide leaf drug
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties from Afghanistan and Pakistan,
or the wide leaf sativa hybrids,
[SPEAKER_04]: which dominate the American California
West Coast market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gets my mouth watering talking about haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of mouth, when you take a haze
and you chew on a little bud, I think the
[SPEAKER_08]: little ringing that you get in between the
cheek and gum that we was talking about is
[SPEAKER_08]: partly due to probably terpenylene,
but probably all the terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_08]: just, again, being absorbed into the
mucosa there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because it's probably the
most uniformly beneficial plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get into, without going down that
rabbit hole, but when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: specific and rare neurological conditions
and others, you really see the fine
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in the concept of the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were going to generalize and
say, okay, we have a broad target that
[SPEAKER_02]: works for a lot of neurological regulatory
issues, albeit epilepsy or spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder conditions, the first strain that
ever worked for silo is one that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: continued to cultivate and has been
universally, probably one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial plants that we've worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out at about 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forrest, isn't that the one where they
found pyrethring being produced by the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant genetically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been able to see it in our own
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a special plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's something with my terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Forrest, it's a two-to-one, did you say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: On average, no, it fluctuates a little,
but yeah, right in that window.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two CBD to every one THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazingly beneficial profile that
it produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to say to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really high in terpenes,
Forrest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a lot of bag stank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At times.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the flowering period on that one,
Forrest?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's somewhere around 10 to 12
weeks, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some going this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Wade pops in, we'll get him to chime
in because he's produced it for me a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of the expert in that world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's grown, that's where I take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade, where are we at with medihase on the
flowering time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Medihase is one of those that is pretty
stable in its ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that it's pretty ideal at about 10
weeks, going from 1st of August for
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering initiation in our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: That puts it around the middle of October
for an outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, what I found with that one
and a lot of the other cultivars that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're using for the medicine process,
we harvest when there are still some
[SPEAKER_05]: trichomes that are clear on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bulk of them have gone milky,
but before you start seeing a lot of amber
[SPEAKER_05]: trichomes, which is more typically when I
would harvest a THC variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wade, have all the hairs turned red from
white?
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, medihase is still producing
white hairs at 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's under natural photo period or under
artificial?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's outdoors in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my sense that it could go longer,
Sam, but we have at our elevation and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatnot location in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a greenhouse in Santa Cruz,
I had a haze that was planted in July and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was harvested the 1st of April.
[SPEAKER_04]: We called it April Fool's Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took so freaking long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was insane under natural photo period
in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people with long experiences with
cannabis start to take a daily supplement
[SPEAKER_02]: of some of the concentrates and oils that
we make from this and come back and say
[SPEAKER_02]: they've never experienced something quite
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of that is to do with some of
them haven't used a supplement approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something new to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that is just its effect,
beneficial effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the body, I'd be happy to send you guys
some at some point, but yeah, it's it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you bring up the unique
personality and unique expression of the
[SPEAKER_02]: haze plan, I can't help but think what the
background is.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the guy for that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love watching Marcus pull monster
fucking rips, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice fucking nice rep, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, what I know about medihase is it's
from Jamie in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the seeds that I first worked
with came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had it brought over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you know Jamie at Rosin Seeds,
he could give you more background on it.
Jamie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask him sometime when I talk to him
next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe we make it to Spain this next
upcoming March.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we got to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe we missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done a lot of work for folks that are
interested in CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a variety 10 years before,
but I licensed it to a big pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, they've been working their butts
off with CBD and they're going to make it
[SPEAKER_04]: so there will be legal products.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know how big pharmaceutical
companies are?
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not real good about open and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't like to share, do they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dr. Russo talks about a strain that
GW Pharmaceuticals have that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: really like to get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is expressed as really high in CBD and
CBC with a really heavily balanced land.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CBD variety was developed by me and it
was not particularly high in CBC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We developed another variety that was
extremely high in CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the one I'm talking about that
they've worked with and have now is high
[SPEAKER_02]: in CBD and CBC with a LAN a little
dominant terpene profile, which is someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who's interested in antispasmatic
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to get my hands on that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy that you just can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was licensed to GW.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't give it to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's got to be like a weird position for
someone like anyone working for that
[SPEAKER_09]: company for that matter, meeting people
who are like, oh, I'd really love to get
[SPEAKER_09]: that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, well, you know, I can't give it
to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, but I really need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this isn't like, it's not a monetary
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, can't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little, little kids slowly season the
death, but you know, it's so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I get capitalism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also say that GW has probably done
more than any other medical company,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether intended or not to, uh,
to help move medical cannabis forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's obvious that it's real when
people like this are involved and they
[SPEAKER_04]: were just first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of other cannabis
companies out there now.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't share a cut while you're
driving the newest and latest Ferrari,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're fucking evil.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really no way around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Patent coverage on any of those molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those molecules are all in the public
domain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where the folly is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully, you know, enough people
work, enough people, enough Elon Musk's
[SPEAKER_09]: make work that they put out there without,
uh, you know, trying to control it right
[SPEAKER_09]: down to the last drop because,
uh, I mean, it started.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: This didn't start in the, you know,
that you can take this human nature right
[SPEAKER_09]: down to the lowest denominator.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I saw it in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw people absolutely not sharing with
one another because they were like,
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I own the market on this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to, you know, it's like your
strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got seeds given to you or you've
got a CD bag weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that's your strain that you've
named and you own and nobody gets,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you won't share it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you like to brag about it,
but you're not giving it to anyone,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you can buy it for 3,200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is their share.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is their, they renamed the clone that
they got from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's theirs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I know so many people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people like my friends that have
done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's half the, that's half the,
uh, product market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is marketing to families.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's not our four.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ACDC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Hillary's helper, you know,
and it's our own, it's our own strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, if you want to save
your, uh, child or your loved one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can only get Hillary's helper from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's, that's pretty much
what they do to keep people dependent on
[SPEAKER_02]: their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, they change eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let forest finish.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just, that's something that we see
commonly that is an intentional move that
[SPEAKER_02]: most people don't recognize to keep people
dependent on specific products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they take the, the name of the
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something you can get
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something you can only get from us
because it's our particular strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: When in reality, um, some of them,
for example, we know and know the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that gave them the initial ACDC or our
four plants that they may have bred and
[SPEAKER_02]: then called something new and they don't
tell them how to dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two big tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't say how many milligrams are in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They train people to dose based on volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only Hillary's helper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only know I get like 0.5
milliliters, but nothing on the bottle
[SPEAKER_02]: tells me exactly what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's intentional to keep people
dependent on that one product because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the information necessary to
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could move on and treat yourself or
work with other medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, it's not an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see that with strains all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually everything will be marketed by
terpene and cannabidi profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll be able to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, very similar products yourself very
easily.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because the names won't be able to
lie anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it'll be exactly what Chimera said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make the name, the constituents that make
up what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what makes the name.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The names can be, you know, secondary for
the people who existed for all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can be like, Oh man, I love the terpene
lean mercy delimiting AKA that sourdough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Riesel or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's going to be ways to still
connect those names to those terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for me personally, I'm more interested
in people knowing what they're getting
[SPEAKER_09]: each and every time accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something we do quite a bit is
to just help the families develop the
[SPEAKER_02]: right language.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not, um, this brand name
that's saving your loved one or your mom
[SPEAKER_02]: or dad or child.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, let's learn about what you're
dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's learn about what's in it because
that's what's going to free you to not be
[SPEAKER_02]: dependent on this one company,
you know, who may be charging you,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, somewhere around 25 cents a milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: When in reality, you can really take care
of yourself in a much more affordable way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you learn exactly what it is you're
given in dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like it's been a lot of trouble with
some people, but that's just the way it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I love where you're coming from,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's very much where I've come from
for the longest time, even when,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, promoting Prana through Tony's
company in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, we need this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, bro, you have coconuts and you
have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know the recipes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, dude, I can promise you start
soaking it in coconut oil, using different
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars, bioassaying, you'll find the
one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to kill you trying it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have access to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much analytical information in
Jamaica because everyone uses it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like everyone, just some people don't talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they get the grandma using it for the
tea for her cramps and her arthritis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she'll go out and give her
grandson a smack in the back of the head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause he's smoking a spliff and he doesn't
know she's using ganja, but she is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time, you know,
I've had, I do classes where we'll teach
[SPEAKER_02]: families how to make medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just try to work towards independence
as much as we can and empowering and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, last time I got threatened to be
sued was from a company who wanted to,
[SPEAKER_02]: who has a nasal spray product that they've
convinced people that they've just spent
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of hours and all this money on
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in reality, it is just a, it's just
MCT oil and an Amazon nasal sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are, you know, wanting to patent
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as families that little guy right
there, you know, we've, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with epileptics, there's three
forms of rescue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's sublingual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rectal or it's nasal sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been messing around with all those
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this company in Colorado
decided they could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a video go viral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden they started
threatening to sue organizations like
[SPEAKER_02]: mine, the Gladius network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they wanted the quarter of the
market and they just teach and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulate parents and saying this,
you can't do this safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only, we can do it in this high lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only get it from us or you're
risking your child's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when those of us who are educated and
have known it, been working with this for
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time, know that they're just
putting the same spray they put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sublingual drops in a nasal sprayer and
they see big dollars at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably doing, there's some
chemistry to emulsify if it's an oil born
[SPEAKER_08]: one to make it not separate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll probably be the patents,
not the method of getting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would they want to take away one of
the three ways that you can stop us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't separate an MCT?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's no problem there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it, is it a water based, um,
nasal spray?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's MCT.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says you're basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would put that company on major blast,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that's like, that's like the epitome
of evil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, you're coming at it from the
worst place.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't even be surprised to look at
the board of, uh, of that company and see
[SPEAKER_09]: it's like the ex police chief,
the ex health minister, the ex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, and that, that company in
particular, that company in particular is
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the worst at convincing parents and
families that they're good guys by keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: them in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny when you try to teach some
parents about it, they'll lash out at you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and they'll come back at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these people are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saints, they're saviors,
and they just don't realize how much
[SPEAKER_02]: they're being exploited, but we're going
to keep fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's Martin Shkreli's,
uh, cannabis company, his CBT.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a, a him thing to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Uh, get the control of the drug there
and raise the price a thousand percent
[SPEAKER_09]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Spended in MCT oil is not an invention.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's open art.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't claim and you can't shut down
people who use, no, no, no, you can claim
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can go through court and then you
can find out that you can't.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can do whatever you want when it
comes to these insane patent laws,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, I can just start telling,
I can come up with a bunch of shit and say
[SPEAKER_09]: any patent is, is breaching my thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, it doesn't often just get
wiped off the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, Oh, good business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's bring this in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make, let's get, let's see how much
money we can suck out of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all lawyers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's called a slap.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy went as far to go on Silas's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aware awareness page and start making
threats and calling us thieves for taking
[SPEAKER_02]: his product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy's got a multimillion dollar
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the biggest CBD companies out
of Colorado, you know, and they know that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're giving it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not even selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he has no ground for any lawsuit
because the collateral network doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: sell anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and his, his patents are nonsense that
he's saying that he has, but this is just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the level that, that some of these
people go to, to keep control on the
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of why I brought it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that it was, um, we were selling
and cutting into his market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that they don't want people to know
that there's really no magic behind this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, this plant is there for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as you want to inform yourself
and educate yourself, you can take some
[SPEAKER_02]: control into your own hands and your own
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people who don't like
that about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the reasons it's been so hard
to monopolize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pharmaceutical companies can't take
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them try learning the same hard
lesson as they just try to grasp on the
[SPEAKER_02]: control as much as they can.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost all in the language forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you hear people say, I helped,
I did this, I did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, my fire alarms, my spider
sense goes off.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when they say, you know, I
cannabinoids helped them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I pointed them in the direction of
cannabinoids and that helped them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, it was the cannabinoids that
helped them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, let's not take credit.
[SPEAKER_09]: For such silly things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so Donald Trump-esque.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, huge crowd in Houston.
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge crowd.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great to see all you people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, dude, that is douchebaggery at
the highest degree.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like, you know what that's like?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like giving a homeless person half
a sandwich or money, and then going home
[SPEAKER_09]: and posting about it on your social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just want to let everyone know
today, I gave a homeless person some money
[SPEAKER_09]: because I'm such a good person.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you all to know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, man, it was good that you maybe
gave that person a sandwich, but then you
[SPEAKER_09]: ruined it by talking about it and having
to tell everything about it and turning it
[SPEAKER_09]: into an ego thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, I love it when you take big rips
because your mind is fucking awesome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, big rips definitely unleash whatever
this is in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some people call it the opposite
of awesome, but I'll take that on a Sunday
[SPEAKER_09]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big rips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, everyone ready for a big rip?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a huge rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at these rips.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we have any other topic,
but I know you're ripped, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I've been ripping is this
little terp vaporizer and the grass that I
[SPEAKER_11]: got, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got 10 major types of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it tasty as muck?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that, like 3%, 4% terpenes?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's really high, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know the exact percentage,
but it's three different types with each
[SPEAKER_11]: strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: One strain has seven to nine different
types of majors.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many different terpenes you can
test for, but as far as the major ones,
[SPEAKER_11]: this one's got seven to nine each strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look forward to the day where we go as
deep as the machines will let us and just
[SPEAKER_09]: go as deep as we can because I'm also a
firm believer for whatever reason that the
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes that are in the lesser amounts
could be just as important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, you're probably... I mean,
it's just an opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing to back it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm learning too, and I agree 100% with
you, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those little macro doses of the other ones
probably act as a catalyst to some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: other ones to maybe make their efficacy
enhanced.
[SPEAKER_09]: So without the one, that perfect balance,
I have a hard time believing that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: there for no reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally right, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also one of our... I predict
right here and now, because when I've
[SPEAKER_04]: tested for terpenes, I always found plus
50.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be more, but I only had 100
standards of the 150 terpenes found in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the end effect of it is the terpenes
that we did find, some of them have very
[SPEAKER_04]: positive effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of them had negative effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there could be terpenes that you really
don't want in there also.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's ones that you don't want in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least from a recreational point of
view, from a medical point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: it might be completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about flavor-wise?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen certain strains, terpenes have
absolutely adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an example, there's a high CBD strain
called Electra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Electra 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were using high CBD strains with a
lot of kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically, ACDC is my tried and true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a good terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what's being used a lot by my
Shulam's group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people who are doing medical work
are really kind of stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I switched over with Silas at one
point to Electra because we were out of
[SPEAKER_02]: ACDC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exact same CBD dose, and his seizures went
through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just spiked incredibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of skeptical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it just be something in the system
that's causing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually he said, well, we got to
get the other strain back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they stopped immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something in that terpene and I had
another medicine we gave him once that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't realize had Electra in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both times, he had really adverse
reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only difference in that is their
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you change these formulations that
you're giving him, how quickly do you see
[SPEAKER_08]: a difference in his symptoms, in his
response to it?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you change his oil this morning,
he'll immediately leave today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that has to do with the metabolism
rate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like when we use it in other ways,
it's in our system in its most effective
[SPEAKER_02]: time window.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in that four to six hour range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to use high CBD oils with those
stick with Silas here, but for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had some cognitive benefit,
but it never helped with the seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sees every single day on the dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got to more balanced profiles,
and it was actually that strain medihase
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time, when we started that,
he had like 80 seizures on Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started the medihase Saturday morning,
and he didn't have a seizure for four
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was his first time in three years he
hadn't seized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the onset was immediate.
[SPEAKER_02]: His body immediately had the tools it
needed to correct the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same with the adverse reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we gave it to him that day,
it was like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: What has happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have heard some parents, and Dr.
Bonnie Goldstein has talked about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: attribute a four to six week period to
just keep trying to inflammation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would see that as maybe something
different's going on than an
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid deficiency disorder or a
regulatory issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have constant CBD doses,
there's the thought that what could be
[SPEAKER_02]: happening is some of the swelling starts
to go down in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it goes down to a certain point,
they see all of a sudden the onset of some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's talked about that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my personal experience,
I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it relatively quickly, immediately,
like that day or the next day,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the longest Silas has ever gone
without a seizure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he has 10 different kinds of
seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started him on the medi haze,
he went a year and a half without a single
[SPEAKER_02]: grand mal seizure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ten different kinds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he has 10 different kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within that window, we went almost six
months without any seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had some what are called
myoclonic spasms, these smaller seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a year and a half before he had
what would be considered a dangerous or a
[SPEAKER_02]: serious seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw amazing effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was from 2,500 seizures a month
to zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really when you can't
experience something like that and not be
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% convinced of the efficacy of cannabis
as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is Silas taking, is my voice okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a bit robotic for a second,
but it's good now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering, is Forrest taking just
a rescue dose with the intranasal or is he
[SPEAKER_06]: doing like a daily maintenance dose for
those periods when he's gone seizure free?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you mentioned, he did the one dose
and then was seizure free for three
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is that taking it every day or is he
taking like one treatment and then feeling
[SPEAKER_06]: that effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we see is a lot of people
ask, can cannabis be a cure?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just, no, in what I've read about
how it works in the body and what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen, it's more of a supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those spinal cannabinoids are supplemented
in our endogenous cannabinoid system as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they're gone, the body can no
longer utilize them and the problems and
[SPEAKER_02]: consequences sort of manifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we save some in our oedipus
tissue, so you do get some residual
[SPEAKER_02]: trickling, but for the most part,
it's in the system and it's therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people go a couple of times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that the more consistent I can
keep that level, the more effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go every four hours just to be right
on that point of the metabolism rate in
[SPEAKER_02]: the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: And intranasal every four hours or do you
do oral?
[SPEAKER_02]: Intranasal is only the breakout of a
tonic-clonic seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've 100% been able to use that as a
rescue medication for tonic-clonics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't seen it work really well with
other types of cluster seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to go totally in the
epilepsy world.
[SPEAKER_08]: What dose is effective for rescue in a
nasal spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what's great about
understanding cannabinoids is we've
[SPEAKER_02]: actually been able to adjust that for
different children.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain children who are,
the stuff that's on the market is at five
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams THC per spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just, I don't know why they
landed there, but what we do is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there are some kids who are
sensitive to THC and we've actually seen
[SPEAKER_02]: still benefit by bringing that down to one
milligram THC or two and then having CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: and other cannabinoids in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But typically what you're seeing in the
market and we use something similar for
[SPEAKER_02]: Silas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about around five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 0.1 ml sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they last forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing about the nasal
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's a sensitive issue for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only for life saving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're talking 0.1 ml per spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with a gram, you're offering,
you know, 500, you know, you can offer
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a bit of rescue for a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're supplementing or what
you're relieving is the need for the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical rescue meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are always heavy
benzodiazepines, Ativan, diastatic,
[SPEAKER_02]: versed, you know, so they're really
intense, nasty drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they would cause just as much problem
as the seizures in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you get this benzo withdrawal and
dump afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these just emotional crying
kids and you're trying to console them
[SPEAKER_02]: from the seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've a hundred percent been able to
switch purely to cannabis rescue sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, they're working really well for
us because we use them for tonic clonics,
[SPEAKER_02]: other types of clusters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen them work, you know,
so kids who have focal clusters or
[SPEAKER_02]: myoclonic clusters, it doesn't seem to
work, but something about when the brain's
[SPEAKER_02]: in that full tonic clonic seizure mode,
20, 20 seconds or so, they snap right out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one more question for you,
Forrest, if you didn't mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you went through the
variety of extraction processes to find
[SPEAKER_09]: the one that you guys are using now,
or if you just kind of came across that
[SPEAKER_09]: one early and it worked and that's the one
you've stuck with.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we, we went through, so I've used,
well, I haven't used all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always stayed away from BHO type of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because, you know, I don't know
a lot of people down here who do it super
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but we have went through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some MediHaze rosin right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good, good amount of MediHaze
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through those processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through CO2 and then settled on
the ethanol extraction, not because I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be 100% solvent free, but one,
the people that we have doing it are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the best I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get really good at your craft,
you're able to get the solvents out for
[SPEAKER_02]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that did is it, and I wish we had
a smell vision here where I could have you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys experience it, but it's a process
that is able to really maintain a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole plant and in working with what I
had to work with, the CO2 extractors that
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crystal clear, but it was really,
there was almost no smell to it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really extracted out a lot of the,
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are people who are able to do
it with the terpenes, but I didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: access to it at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we settled on that because it got me
the best whole plant profile from what we
[SPEAKER_02]: had to work with down here is in our
communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horace, can I ask one more question?
[SPEAKER_06]: What was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, with the different types of cultivars
you're finding, are you paying attention
[SPEAKER_06]: to the terpene profiles?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, have you noticed like linalool has
been helpful?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know that that has some effect
efficacy for different types of seizures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering if you have any
experience with that or working with
[SPEAKER_06]: lavender or other plants that can also be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Together with cannabis, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some test results in front of me,
Forrest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about ACDC being a benefit
to Silas and how Electra was problematic
[SPEAKER_05]: for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went and found some of the test
results from those two varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ACDC has in this particular test
results, it's a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is a tincture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three quarters of a percent terpenyline,
a little bit of linalool, less than a
[SPEAKER_05]: tenth of a percent, a third of a percent
beta-mercine, citronella, the carophylene
[SPEAKER_05]: oxide, and then beta-carophylene is by far
the largest terpene in that test result.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, if you go over here to
Electra 4, the big one by far is terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenyline is 1.8% and 2.2% limonene in
Electra and almost a percent of
[SPEAKER_05]: beta-mercine, but no beta-carophylene and
no, what was that other one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Significantly reduced amount of
terpenyline in ACDC compared to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Electra 4.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about linalool?
[SPEAKER_06]: You said there was a little bit in the
ACDC, but in the Electra, was there any?
[SPEAKER_05]: None.
[SPEAKER_05]: No linalool in the Electra.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting because one of my
favorite cultivars being the Hayes
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties, it seems to be high in
terpenyline, really does mess with certain
[SPEAKER_09]: people's central nervous systems and just
blows them into full blown anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it so many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome Alec.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just talking testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: When are you guys going to start testing
for more terpenes?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, for one, terpenyline is one of my
favorite terpenes and it took me a while
[SPEAKER_11]: to get into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to be in the Navy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in the Navy for five years and when
I first got out of the Navy, terpenyline
[SPEAKER_11]: was actually the terpenes my buddy shared
in a bowl with me and I freaked out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had such a bad experience that I had to
go excuse myself from our hangout and I
[SPEAKER_11]: had to go to sleep and it set me off on a
path where for the first 10, 20 times,
[SPEAKER_11]: it gave me incredible anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The conversation we're having right now,
Forrest was talking about different CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars that he was using for Silas and
that the one, I guess what we're figuring
[SPEAKER_09]: out here from what Wade was saying,
and correct me if I'm wrong, but one of
[SPEAKER_09]: the main differences was terpenyline that
in the one that set Silas off,
[SPEAKER_09]: there was a higher level of terpenyline.
[SPEAKER_09]: Electra, was it called?
[SPEAKER_05]: Electra 4 had almost four times the amount
in a similar preparation of terpenyline as
[SPEAKER_05]: ACDC.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both have very similar cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that mechanism is similar,
that mechanism that gives people an
[SPEAKER_09]: anxiety attack and sets off.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemingly feels like your entire
central nervous system has been just like
[SPEAKER_09]: set off and I can imagine if you ... Go
ahead, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we're moving into speculation or
maybe Natasha ... Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think if you look at just
logic would lead us to believe that when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about epilepsy in general
and some other neurological conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about over-excitation at the
presynaptic nerve.
[SPEAKER_02]: An overactive nerve that the
endocannabinoid system is failing to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: into homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're feeling these effects of maybe
anxiety or things like that, that to me
[SPEAKER_02]: leads me to believe that there's a higher
level of bonding at that CB1 receptor that
[SPEAKER_02]: would all lead kind of into the same
direction and that could be something that
[SPEAKER_02]: is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone much smarter than I should look
into that, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a really good call on that
too because I've seen quite a few times at
[SPEAKER_11]: different kind of big cannabis culture
events when somebody's almost being served
[SPEAKER_11]: up with way too big of a dab or dose of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It almost looks like they slightly start
to go into a convulsive type situation or
[SPEAKER_11]: like a mini seizure type thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting in the overexcitement of
the CB1 receptor or overstimulation of the
[SPEAKER_11]: CB1 receptor because when that seems to
happen, it seems to set people off even if
[SPEAKER_11]: they're once enjoying cannabis into this
path of kind of starting to become more
[SPEAKER_11]: anxiety each time you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think it's also a combination of
low blood sugar and low blood pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: that sets people off like this?
[SPEAKER_09]: To a degree, but Sam, I'll tell you
something because you've been smoking full
[SPEAKER_09]: melt the longest.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might have a faded view of the reality
of the situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: By 1999 when I released bubble bags and
started making full melt bubble,
[SPEAKER_09]: that was new to most people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to you, but to most people it was new.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you, I knocked out dozens of
people in those days and I did not give
[SPEAKER_09]: them huge monster rips.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just be like, here, have a rip or we'd
roll a snake into a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, we go to a Ben Harper concert.
[SPEAKER_09]: Five people in one night, unconscious,
fall down, forward, sideways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I very rarely see anyone unless it's at
some weird cup and they're dehydrated and
[SPEAKER_09]: they haven't slept in two days because
they've traveled far.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see it the odd time there,
but I used to see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it got so bad that I wanted to get
pads for in front of my booth at the
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we were still at the PAX party house,
because so many people collapsed in front
[SPEAKER_09]: of my booth, like completely collapsed and
other people's booths as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I seen a guy collapse on top of Ham's,
Ham Brushlin had a little glass booth one
[SPEAKER_09]: year and this kid fell literally on Ham's
glass and then rolled over onto the next
[SPEAKER_09]: guy's glass table.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like breaking glass like you wouldn't
believe it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I used to see a lot was people would
sort of sit or squat and take a hit and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they would stand up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a good way to fall down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know a lot about CBD and some of
these other cannabinoids as much as we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to know, but one of the things we do
know is how it modulates THC's ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: bond to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we learn that, and then you take that
to what people explain, like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, when I have THC or CBD and I
introduce CBD, it relieves the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It relieves some of these negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is important, I think, to realize is
that when THC bonds to that CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not just a black and white response.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long it bonds is like a spectrum of
what type of effects you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the longer end of that bonding
spectrum where you can see some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: panic and anxiety and those sort of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when we hear people talk about,
oh, I used to smoke in the 60s and 70s and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to giggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get all these negative effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just that cannabis is stronger in
THC levels, which obviously it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's the combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a one-two punch of more THC and less
of the cannabinoids that are there to
[SPEAKER_02]: modulate how THC bonds to that receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get longer bonding times, which has an
intense effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you compound that by concentrating it
in other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're going to have some...
[SPEAKER_02]: That's therapy right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think the future of general
cannabis, hint out there, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: in that six to one, one to six sort of
balanced spectrum, more in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really pushed it out to THC,
but I think as craft cannabis becomes more
[SPEAKER_02]: and more desired, as we push those
spectrums maybe back inward, we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to find more of that effect that has
different bubbly or giggly sort of effects
[SPEAKER_02]: that people miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't take a hit and have a bad
experience that makes you never want to
[SPEAKER_02]: come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be a market in
the future for just some... Sometimes we
[SPEAKER_02]: want Jack Daniels and sometimes we want a
Coors Light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't you get really, really high quality
cannabis or dry sift or whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: product is and just take a smaller amount
rather than taking such large amounts?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard to do when you're smoking
though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the hard part about taking a
rip?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's hard for the human ego,
but I constantly am all about turning
[SPEAKER_09]: people on to taking a rip without having a
bad experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I microdose people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I give them the smallest, tiniest... Some
people say it's perfect and others are
[SPEAKER_09]: like, oh, I didn't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, well, now you can take another one
instead of being all whited out on that
[SPEAKER_09]: chair right now because you took too big a
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dose low and titrate slow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially when you're trying to frame a
positive response with your endocrine
[SPEAKER_11]: albinoid system.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially for people that have
post-traumatic stress, whether it's a vet
[SPEAKER_11]: or anybody that's experienced trauma
because from what I've seen is so
[SPEAKER_11]: typically they almost have a higher
propensity to have this really negative
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of inner kind of at least at the
beginning because what you see with a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of vets is that the Iraq vets and then the
Afghan war vets, the ones that come back
[SPEAKER_11]: with post-traumatic stress, try to start
using cannabis, have a really high
[SPEAKER_11]: propensity to have this incredibly
negative kind of effect from taking THC
[SPEAKER_11]: even in somewhat moderate amounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then what you see is that when they
start working with, like you guys were
[SPEAKER_11]: saying, like a 20 to one six to one,
have you microdosing THC, having higher
[SPEAKER_11]: doses CBD, going through the ritual of
kind of rolling up a joint and grinding up
[SPEAKER_11]: some herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it really start to prime people's
system in a positive way where they can
[SPEAKER_11]: start to tease out the beneficial effects
and then over time start to be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: titrate up the THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what you see is a flip.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really feel like whenever you start
working with cannabis, you almost go
[SPEAKER_11]: through just like right a passage because
sometimes you got to feel weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all in control of your mind and
your ego.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes you need to let go and the
cannabis plant really humbles you out in
[SPEAKER_11]: that way and almost like slams you into
the ground if you fight it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think it's almost something that
we all need to go through at some point or
[SPEAKER_11]: another when we're working with cannabis
to truly have the respect for the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's such a service that we have to
set it up right for people because we
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know what they're going through and
if they're going through some really heavy
[SPEAKER_11]: post-traumatic stress or what have you,
they might be set off forever if we give
[SPEAKER_11]: them too big of a dose of THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then eventually over time,
once they've developed that relationship
[SPEAKER_11]: and established that, passed through the
rite of passage with the plant and their
[SPEAKER_11]: relationship with the plant, you see them
typically flip.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you look at the old Vietnam vets
and the Korean War vets, typically they're
[SPEAKER_11]: like Sam, they're like fuck CBD,
that's for blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they smoke like high terpenaline kind
of sativa type feeling strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think it's all about building up
and that dose low titrate slow thing so
[SPEAKER_11]: you can experience a maximized positive
effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question Alec.
[SPEAKER_11]: So not too long ago I smoked some hash I
think and I started shaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't cold but I felt like I was really
cold and I was just shaking and I was like
[SPEAKER_11]: I can handle my grass.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've ridden the fucking snake man and I'm
okay with the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Turned into Mother Earth, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was shaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was shaking like my hand was shaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't know if I was channeling a
lot of energy at the time or if I was
[SPEAKER_11]: just, and so I read about it online.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went out and I checked it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what that was was that it was a THC
overdose.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting because that's happened
to me quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_11]: It hasn't happened to me any time in the
most recent time and maybe it's because
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm down regulated or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I used to call it the stone chills.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if I smoked certain types of bed,
I would go full body shakes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm almost like teeth chatter and I was
like wow I feel really cold but I'm not
[SPEAKER_11]: really cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a real interesting thing to study.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have a blanket on.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're shaking as if you're freezing
cold and you're just so fucked up man that
[SPEAKER_11]: you're shaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I read was that it was a THC OD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that if you take a little bit of the
turps, it'll kind of balance it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think talking or listening to Marcus
earlier, what he was saying about the fact
[SPEAKER_11]: that he has ingested this comprehensive
diversity of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what it did was it gave him this clear
crisp fucking vibe where he was conscious
[SPEAKER_11]: collected and just refined but really
feeling great.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he wasn't tweaking out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe that has something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No shaking there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that shaking and your teeth
chattering, both of those can also be
[SPEAKER_04]: related to low blood sugar and low blood
pressure which can be brought on by large
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts of THC quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well you guys were talking about people
falling over and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe that THC too much of that could
have something to do with it where there
[SPEAKER_11]: isn't a good balance of the terpene or the
entourage effect, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: The combination of the terpenes with the
THC to really regulate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're just doing straight THC shots,
maybe that could have something to do with
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think terpenes help it happen even
easier if the right terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever get those shakes, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have really low blood sugar,
I can't regulate my body heat so easy or I
[SPEAKER_04]: will get shakes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the shaking bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome Khaymary.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had something to say on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not on the shaking part,
but just on the people being novel users.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, the ones that come up often are
people that want to try cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time after they've been drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're conditioned by society to be
against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when they've had a few drinks,
they've got their inhibitions down and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're a little more likely to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really a good combination for
success.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a good combo for success because
people get the spins and then they are off
[SPEAKER_03]: it for life like Alec was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing on dosing, and I had this
experience with my mom once.
[SPEAKER_03]: She came out to visit and I had some
pounds and kilos and kilos of seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and everything in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all stashed away and hidden.
[SPEAKER_03]: She came out and I had had a surgery to
relax.
[SPEAKER_03]: She took a little bit too much and was in
my room 15 minutes later trying to call
[SPEAKER_03]: the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to talk her down and I knew all the
signs.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had that fast heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: People when they're stoned, they feel that
fast heartbeat, that tachycardia,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is actually an effect of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your friends are ever shaking too much,
the best thing to do is to give them a
[SPEAKER_04]: large sifting bowl with a screen at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wanted to go to the hospital but she
came in and she was like, we need to call
[SPEAKER_03]: the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was having that panic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, when you get that tachycardia
and you're stoned, people self-interpret
[SPEAKER_03]: that as something catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, even worse than that,
first they react to it and they increase
[SPEAKER_09]: their heartbeat even more.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when they think they're going to
die.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a self-feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_03]: High tachycardia, they interpret it as
catastrophic, their heart rate goes up
[SPEAKER_03]: even more.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have fear and then they get fear of
the fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually pretty easy to bring her
down because I came out as a scientist and
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, okay, look, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just having tachycardia.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 15 minutes, this is going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make you a glass of tea kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to walk her off the ledge,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as the indoctrinated, we need to
be cognizant of who we're indoctrinating
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we indoctrinate them too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't line somebody up with their
first time with a fucking gram dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about micro-dosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis, do you see to a naive user,
to a system that's never been primed
[SPEAKER_03]: before, is a really strong drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a video on YouTube you can look
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find the name and I'll say it later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure the name, but it's just
college kids in the dorm room and they
[SPEAKER_02]: give this kid who's never smoked cannabis
in his life this huge ripping dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets cannabinoid-induced paralysis on
the spot, which is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. O'Shaughnessy first wrote about it in
the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, they go to touch him and he snaps
out of it and he goes into this huge panic
[SPEAKER_02]: attack because he was conscious but
couldn't move.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's remarkably funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that video because I like to have
the conversation about all use is
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal use because I think that really
means that there's nothing we could ever
[SPEAKER_02]: do wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use anything irresponsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That video really is a great example
because that kid is likely ruined from
[SPEAKER_02]: ever having some sort of healthy
relationship with cannabis in his life
[SPEAKER_02]: because the people who are with him
thought it would be funny and thought it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just using it irresponsibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs are a choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be dosing people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be sandbagging people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to call it sandbagging,
loading somebody up with a bunch of LSD
[SPEAKER_03]: when they aren't expecting the hit,
but I think it's totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs are a choice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your state of mind is a choice and you
have to be prepared for that altered state
[SPEAKER_11]: of mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the things that ... I might
have even mentioned this before on
[SPEAKER_11]: HashChurch, but I do a lot of education
training for blood tenders.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really try to impart how much of a
responsibility it is because everybody,
[SPEAKER_11]: since they have such varying levels of
endocannabinoid system tone and tolerance
[SPEAKER_11]: and doing it drunk and you get crossfaded
or just the slightest bit having such a
[SPEAKER_11]: lighting off effect of all your CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the trippiest parts about it is
most people that I've come across ... It's
[SPEAKER_11]: so fascinating how many people say,
oh, it's not for me or oh, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: these days is so strong.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to smoke cannabis back then.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens to people that are first time
users.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens to people that take significant
breaks in between for months or years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it happens to people one day that
just are steady users that take all of a
[SPEAKER_11]: sudden a full gram dab and then flip the
script and then they're freaking out for
[SPEAKER_11]: the rest of the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really, really interesting ... I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really hope that there's a lot of
research around this topic because it
[SPEAKER_11]: seems like it happens very ... almost
predictable for so many different types of
[SPEAKER_11]: these patients coming into contact or
coming into use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that much more of an importance to
set it up right because- Well,
[SPEAKER_11]: let's face it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's not supposed to use it or
somebody's intended in their lifetime to
[SPEAKER_11]: use it for this certain autoimmune
condition that they have, but this little
[SPEAKER_11]: 18-year-old blood tender gives them a 28%
high terpenolene dominant ghost train haze
[SPEAKER_11]: or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: That person probably won't ever smoke
again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then that person pretty much has that on
his karma or her karma because that person
[SPEAKER_11]: might have been intended to come into a
relationship with this plant in a really
[SPEAKER_11]: respectful, awesome way to where they
could have eventually gotten to enjoy that
[SPEAKER_11]: type of a dose or that type of a terapene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think partly it's also due to the fact
that we live in an incredibly immature
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a complete market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have all the chemotypes that are
possible in the species on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have all these different
percentages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, where is there an 8% pining
dominant variety on the market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dispensaries wouldn't buy it, which is
really the worst possible thing because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a whole class of people that would
really benefit from that type of product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as we move forward- They're
feeding the prohibition market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these are echoes of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move into a more developed and
mature marketplace, I think that all these
[SPEAKER_03]: products will have a place in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start seeing these
non-mersing dominant type IIs of different
[SPEAKER_03]: types and other cannabinoid combinations
that are essentially THC with another
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid and that other cannabinoid can
act as a buffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get excited by this stuff because we're
at the beginning of this journey,
[SPEAKER_03]: heading on these paths and having these
more tools that we can use like we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about when we're indoctrinating
new people into the market or into the
[SPEAKER_03]: ceremony, essentially into the- That's
interesting too because with CBD,
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD with THC is almost like a buffer
cannabinoid for the novice or
[SPEAKER_11]: inexperienced user as opposed to a propyl
like THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: THCV combined with THC, which might be the
blast off added freak out or something
[SPEAKER_11]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or CBG or maybe even CBC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say THCV?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was speculative.
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably know more about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just saying the novice user back
used a one-to-one THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: THCV does not get too high at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a CBD one antagonist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: THCV does?
[SPEAKER_11]: I always heard it was kind of like a-
Yeah, we all did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we always heard, but it's not
true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the effect of you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it- I've smoked it pure and I also
created varieties that were 20,
[SPEAKER_04]: 30, 40, 80, 89% THCV.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, and so you said it's a CB1 receptor
antagonist?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a neutral antagonist.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a neutral antagonist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more similar to CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Micro dosing is the way from what you guys
are saying as professionals within the
[SPEAKER_11]: industry to bring new users into the
efficacy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hand a 14-year-old a bottle of 151
proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only 14-year-olds, I wish Hillary
was in the room right now because she
[SPEAKER_09]: works with elderly people, people in their
70s, 80s, 90s, and even 100-year-old
[SPEAKER_09]: people who are using cannabis for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hillary Black, the founder of the BC
Compassion Club, who now works through
[SPEAKER_09]: Bedrocon, through Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what she does.
[SPEAKER_09]: She works with a lot of different elderly
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: She told the story on the all-female hash
church panel there where she turned her
[SPEAKER_09]: grandma on to, I think her grandma's like
101.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really, really cool, cool stories.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to take a 90-year-old
person or a 100-year-old person and give
[SPEAKER_09]: them a half-gram dab, or just some crazy,
huge edible.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like cuddling somebody.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's maniacal.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's maniacal for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even, we've got to be careful with
experienced users, too, because if you've
[SPEAKER_06]: taken a break from cannabis and haven't
consumed in a while and then think your
[SPEAKER_06]: dose is where it used to be, you're going
to be on your butt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, with new routes of
administration, we all know smoking is
[SPEAKER_06]: very different than eating, which is
different than suppositories.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, someone being introduced to a
different method of consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people don't want to
consume it by smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of new users, their first
experience is with eating it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, it's just a cookie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a brownie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then go into full-mode panic attack
and think they're dying and want to never
[SPEAKER_06]: want to eat cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the smell of it grosses them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do not want to give people that
experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I also like to always try to
get people to create a ritual out of it,
[SPEAKER_11]: because they see just the act of sitting
there and grinding up an herb and going
[SPEAKER_11]: through the process of almost praying to
it or putting your intentions into it and
[SPEAKER_11]: learning how to roll a joint with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though you make your dose of THC,
you're still going through all these
[SPEAKER_11]: actions that seem in some way to prime,
I'm sure at least with placebo or
[SPEAKER_11]: something, start to do something with your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's part of speculation.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think the more we bring ceremony or
ritual into most of our practices,
[SPEAKER_11]: the better our experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and tension also.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using cannabis and expecting it
to go badly, it's going to go badly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have a high anxious feeling
about using it, and Chimera brought up
[SPEAKER_06]: first users a lot, a lot of the time is
with cannabis, or sorry, is with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_06]: because alcohol lowers your inhibitions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you'll try cannabis where before
you wouldn't have tried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have a bad experience where
you feel too dizzy, you get too sleepy,
[SPEAKER_06]: it ruins your party.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they blame the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they blame the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't blame it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they say there's PCP in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they are going into this experience
with billions upon billions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_09]: propaganda that have gotten them so
terrified, terrified at the idea of being
[SPEAKER_09]: high, that many people still to this day
will choose massive surgeries,
[SPEAKER_09]: chemotherapies, radiation therapies,
over the even trying a plant first,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're too afraid to get high.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, I would rather have my arm
removed than get high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's serious propaganda.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a serious fucking propaganda when
you have people that afraid that they will
[SPEAKER_09]: do surgery on their body before trying a
benign herb that may or may not work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to remember too, I mean,
I've seen this a bunch of times when
[SPEAKER_03]: people get up there and age, it's
threatening to their whole world to start
[SPEAKER_03]: believing that the things that they were
told and believed is true are actually not
[SPEAKER_03]: true, because it makes them question their
whole reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really, it's a tough thing to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I think what Alec was saying
from the beginning is that whole start low
[SPEAKER_03]: and go slow, low thing with this type of
user was really important because it can
[SPEAKER_03]: be a powerful drug and you want it to be a
nice soft landing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want it to be like rip raw and
high running down the beach kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's refreshing and listening to you,
all of you guys, you professionals in the
[SPEAKER_11]: industry is that, you know, to know that
there's an alternative, because when I,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when I first started smoking
grass, when I was, you know, 17,
[SPEAKER_11]: 18 years old, long time ago, like 20 years
ago or so, we just smoked the whole joint,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and got really high,
really fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all we did.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what everybody did.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now to really know that the industry
has evolved to a point of competency where
[SPEAKER_11]: people can really get the education on how
exactly to micro dose, to take just a very
[SPEAKER_11]: small amount so that you're getting the
healing and all the benefits of this
[SPEAKER_11]: plant, being able to use it, being able to
acclimate it with, to acclimate to it
[SPEAKER_11]: correctly, to, to get to a point where,
where you can actually understand it
[SPEAKER_11]: better instead of being turned off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I could have been when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, another consideration too,
which is such a trip, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got such deep respect and admiration
and yeah, everything for, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: those that are, you know, kind of working
with cancer patients, working with
[SPEAKER_11]: terminally ill patients and, and it's so
crazy, you know, kind of, and my
[SPEAKER_11]: experience with is with, with that is like
Valerie Crell Wham and you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the experience that she has and the
service that she kind of embodies to be in
[SPEAKER_11]: service to people that are sick and poor
and dying, you know, but when somebody's,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, especially, you know,
a cancer patient that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to, you know, kind of utilize
cannabis as maybe the number one resource
[SPEAKER_11]: instead of taking chemo or radiation,
you know, you know, kind of that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I mean, if somebody's never used
cannabis before, they have such a virgin
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid receptor system and,
and this tiniest amount of THC is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: have such a lighting off effect of the CB1
receptors that then, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: they almost have this, you know,
kind of, you know, mountain of hash oil
[SPEAKER_11]: that's decarboxylated or, you know,
combined with CBD or what have you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and it's like, okay, well there,
there's a mountain of hash oil,
[SPEAKER_11]: not, you have to eat it all in the next
hundred days or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I, and I know, you know,
folk people would, you know, cringe at me
[SPEAKER_11]: saying that, but, you know, I mean,
the, the, the way to the most harm
[SPEAKER_11]: reductive space that Valerie has found
that has the most optimal balance and
[SPEAKER_11]: effect is, you know, and just what we're
talking about, it's, it's starting on an
[SPEAKER_11]: oil that you're, you know, ingesting
that's higher in CBD, much higher in CBD
[SPEAKER_11]: and the ratio of CBD to THC and,
and their microdosing THC to be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: baseline tolerance to the psychoactive
effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, yeah, over time start to build
up, you know, to, to, to where,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, there's an optimal kind of ratio
and, and, you know, Valerie finds for a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of different types of cancer,
you know, the ratio ultimately ends up at
[SPEAKER_11]: a higher THC to CBD ratio, but it's still
pretty significant, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, five to one, six to something
like that around THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, to the point where,
you know, these, these, these patients
[SPEAKER_11]: that are like trying to truly take,
bring out, bring out and invoke the
[SPEAKER_11]: medicinal benefit of this plant,
you know, have to go through, I mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: I could, I can only imagine how heavy of
an experience that is while you're,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, kind of dealing with the
existential crisis of the fact that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you, you're taking cannabis in a
way where you have to just fully let go
[SPEAKER_11]: and release, you know, any controls or
things in your ego and, and, and,
[SPEAKER_11]: and eventually, you know, get to the point
where you're taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: in excess of 500 to 1000 milligrams of THC
a day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And same thing, I know people might like
cringe at, you know, that type of a dose,
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's, you know, it's crazy at how,
you know, various and certain types of
[SPEAKER_11]: people end up getting to that dose range.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and then when they, you know,
sustain on that dose, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of over, you know, the next amount of
time, they, they, you know, have these
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible benefits and, you know,
apoptotic or anti-proliferative effects,
[SPEAKER_11]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause you know, I mean, if, if,
you know, this entire panel, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: eat 1500 milligrams of THC between us
would, would probably all get pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: blasted, you know, maybe with an exception
of a couple of us, but it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of us who have eaten
several times 1500 milligrams in a single
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was for recreation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was for cosmonaut years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I go not that's definitely psycho.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, and what's crazy to me is like,
I mean, I'm more scared of the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the, the high dose THC effects because of
what I felt from that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I am from, you know, doing a high
dose, like psilocybin or something like
[SPEAKER_11]: that, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I like, man, I got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to tell you, dude, thank you for
that work, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Yona.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's so much that all that's all
Val, Val Corral, Wham, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and, and other organizations, you know,
like, or that are taking on that level of
[SPEAKER_11]: service.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very grateful for the ability to work
with them and to understand and build my
[SPEAKER_11]: compassion and empathy around what type of
a reality people go through in that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it just, again, such a profound
service, you know, that you, you,
[SPEAKER_11]: we have, we can't like mishandle
essentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: I first met the Corrals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Valerie and is it Mike?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Valerie and Mike Corral.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I first met them at Skunkman Sam's place
for a lovely evening dinner.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great, great place to meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd been friends for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's what I knew.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could tell, obviously you guys were
telling amazing stories and it was just
[SPEAKER_09]: nice to kind of, I mean, this was years
ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: This had to be 12 or 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know when I first met them,
but yeah, I could tell that you guys even
[SPEAKER_09]: then had been friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be great to have them on at some
point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just talked to Valerie yesterday
because we're going to do a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: restored episode here pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I met her in a speaking event as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't, you can't not be inspired
with what she does when you, when you hear
[SPEAKER_02]: her talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Natasha, we have to put that
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think when the Corral, if we get
Valerie and Mike, we definitely got to
[SPEAKER_09]: invite Hillary that day as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, she was a huge, they were a huge
inspiration to Hillary in the starting of
[SPEAKER_09]: the BC compassion club.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love to have them on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who wanted to see that video
that we were talking about, it's guys
[SPEAKER_02]: first marijuana experience ends with freak
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to see how not to introduce
someone to cannabis, or if you want to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what cannabinoid induced paralysis looks
like,
[SPEAKER_08]: fish is wet free webcast tonight because
they're, they're doing a webcast to their
[SPEAKER_08]: show and it's free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the whole like thing,
the whole Chris Corona, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: that really makes the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just gonna say, I'll be watching.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoy like, I mean, I'm a fish
head at heart for many, many years and I
[SPEAKER_09]: don't get to go to shows and Trey got
busted with oxycodone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he can't come to Canada very often.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I couch tour is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, fish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Free link.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would pay too.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely, it's worth the value
of paying like 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can get a package too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can get like the download,
the MP3.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what a great conversation today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, man, we've got into a whole bunch
of different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love when the conversation is just
flowing freely and naturally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting to see the levels
too, you know, the way we can go from
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just always been a planted variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always been a very long stick that
you can go on either way with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even in the conversation, when you're
talking about, you know, assholes
[SPEAKER_09]: basically inducing paralysis and seizures
upon their friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then like angels, like forest,
trying to help people use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine to avoid seizures and paralysis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in this new, we're just
coming into a new time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have the freedom now to
really explore the whole spectrum of types
[SPEAKER_02]: of relationships we can have with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think prohibition has really robbed
us of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just, we have one or a few
different types of relationships with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because it just wasn't to have
more minor or different sort of integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't worth the risk involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: To explore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, and so what was
available to be produced was certain types
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis for certain types of
relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in 10 years from now,
we're going to see a completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: set of options and ways we can integrate
cannabis into our life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been, you know, it's been
hindered by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's just a really exciting
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's something that with the
podcasts that I'm working on, that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent of what we're exploring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is what are these different relationships
and stories that we can have as if,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they have been hindered by
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And not, not just prohibition hindered by
prohibition and continued by big business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one of our panelists just posted the
THCB binding article?
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that may be true, but try smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, I'm just pointing out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Roger Pertwee's article.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just telling you, you know,
what's, what's in the literature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam would probably know that better than
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there's value in the scientist
puffing and understanding the bioassay
[SPEAKER_09]: versus the test and seeing whether they
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scientists that would not out of curiosity
to the substance he's been studying for
[SPEAKER_04]: years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know Roger Pertwee personally,
and he's a really, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a, it reminded me of like a,
does he even lift bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but does he lift?
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he lift Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's metaphor for does he puff?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like this thing where it's hard to
explain, but does he even lift?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a meme.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I let people out themselves if that's what
they want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would have loved the sift means Sam,
because the do you even lift turned into
[SPEAKER_09]: do you even sift and it would show like
old miners and like gold sifters in the
[SPEAKER_09]: like panhandle with their long beards and
their overalls and holding screens over
[SPEAKER_09]: the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you even sift bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: That they were water sifting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were water sifting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have used that in the,
in the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you put that link in the chat for the
YouTube folks so they could see the paper
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_08]: The THCV pharmacology paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say for the record, Roger Pertwee
is an absolute gem of a man and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think he does consume but he is definitely
a supporter of people using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a he's an incredible researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been doing this longer than almost
anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he really is a fantastic person.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: His papers are very well written and very
easy to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, at least I find him easy,
very easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good scientific writer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Roger.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's top tier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Roger is the top of the cannabis
scientist realm.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's doing amazing work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Roger Pertwee?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pertwee?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how I say his last name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Pertwee.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's at the he's at the University of
Aberdeen in northern Scotland.
Scotland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like very, very knowledgeable,
very good at explaining complex material
[SPEAKER_06]: into ways that are easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: He always does the presentation at
conferences where he's like similar to
[SPEAKER_06]: Ethan, where they've got so much material
and they're just like you guys need to
[SPEAKER_06]: know this and you need to know this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's very he's very he wants people
to understand his work, even though his
[SPEAKER_06]: work is complicated.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't Mary Abboud from Aberdeen as well or
University of Aberdeen?
[SPEAKER_11]: She's from Temple.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's from Temple University.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's the other one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Abboud is not still active
academically, is she?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was Jehan Marcuse, PhD advisor.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ruth Ross.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Ruth Ross one of them maybe?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she was another GPR 55 researcher,
I think, at Aberdeen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Research nerds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got all the stats.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got her base.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got her card.
[SPEAKER_09]: She wrote 37 papers in 2011 alone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of the drugs sniffing dog
cards that Sam and Rob had back in the day
[SPEAKER_09]: with like pictures of these dogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd have their name underneath and then
on the back there'd be stats of how much
[SPEAKER_09]: cocaine and herb they were responsible for
getting busted at airports and roadblocks
[SPEAKER_09]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, collector's items, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are like memes before memes were
memes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have my drug sniffing card
collection.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is an unbelievable statement.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to hear you say that, I still have my
drug sniffing dog card collection.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys talk anything about the GPR
119 and the bacteria affecting the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid receptor?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bacteria affecting the cannabinoid
receptor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Natasha, did you read that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you sent it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You informed me of it last night,
but I haven't had a chance to read it yet,
[SPEAKER_06]: so can you give us a summary?
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, I want to tell you guys about
another study, but let's get into this
[SPEAKER_06]: first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I didn't actually delve too deeply
into it, so I was kind of hoping that you
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll prep for next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially what it is is that they're
finding now that gut bacteria are
[SPEAKER_03]: producing compounds that are actually
stimulating some of the less known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orphan receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orphan receptors that are associated with
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microbiota.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the whole microbiome thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a community of life of bacteria
that live with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: In case people haven't heard, there's more
cells of bacteria in your body than there
[SPEAKER_03]: are cells of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interplay of that community and what
they have living as they go about their
[SPEAKER_03]: daily lives, it has a huge impact on your
... Our two systems, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They intercommunicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, the point is that we're starting
to understand now how these systems
[SPEAKER_03]: interact with each other to create health.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is the research group that did the
work?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even looked it up yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's definitely incredible though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tons of CB2 receptors in the gut.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that what John McParland and Karen
Feeding Paper got into how probiotics in
[SPEAKER_11]: your gut help to upregulate CB2 receptor
expression.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy how much from gut dysbiosis,
I would imagine, comes so many different
[SPEAKER_11]: types of disease and disorder.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, psychosomatic type illness also
manifests from your second brain in your
[SPEAKER_11]: gut being out of balance and not working
right to produce the right
[SPEAKER_11]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I guess what also endocannabinoids or
lighting off the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's why it's so important for
cannabis to be cultivated in organic
[SPEAKER_05]: practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: The soil biology contributes to what's
happening on the plant's surfaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we all work with concentrates,
but I think the source material,
[SPEAKER_05]: having a full biota, if you will,
is really an essential part of making
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so awesome you said that because I
just listened to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll post it here in a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on this guy, Dave Asprey's.
[SPEAKER_11]: He has this show called the Bulletproof
Radio.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's this doctor, Dr. Maya
Sheetreat-Kline.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a neurologist, herbalist,
and author of a book called Dirt Here,
[SPEAKER_11]: Healthy Food, Healthy Gut, Healthy
Children.
[SPEAKER_11]: In it, it's all about the opposite of
being the hypochondriac that puts on
[SPEAKER_11]: antimicrobial hand sanitizers five times a
day, but actually from kids playing out in
[SPEAKER_11]: the dirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: From being out gardening and consuming
organically grown crops that have these
[SPEAKER_11]: probiotic soil food web kind of balance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Organisms getting small tiny amounts of
that actually does wonders for our own
[SPEAKER_11]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_11]: In this, she describes how almost being in
the dirt and consuming plants that are
[SPEAKER_11]: organically grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost have more of a beneficial
assistance to helping balance our soil
[SPEAKER_11]: microbiome with the right types of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then even just going to Whole Foods and
popping these lacobacillus or these
[SPEAKER_11]: different refrigerated probiotics that we
get in stores and pay so much money for.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can kind of get the same and better
from just actually being in a healthy
[SPEAKER_11]: environment, soil and gardening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's different bacteria,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all these different types of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have to look at bacteria for,
you can take certain types of bacteria for
[SPEAKER_06]: certain purposes, but most people don't
understand that there's actual ways that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're communicating with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lab that I worked in during my grad
school.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're communicating through us,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, but there's these receptors on
our cells called toll-like receptors.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually recognize basically
different sugars on the surface of
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people will talk about LPS or
lipopolysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an immune marker or that's a
bacteria product that can stimulate your
[SPEAKER_06]: immune response in a bad way and give you
overactive inflammation.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people have little bits of this
compound, this bacteria compound LPS
[SPEAKER_06]: floating around in your gut and talking to
your immune cells and such.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this receptor on our cell called
toll-like receptor four that specifically
[SPEAKER_06]: recognizes this bacteria product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting is it's not only a live
bacteria that our cells can recognize and
[SPEAKER_06]: talk to, they also recognize the bacteria
DNA and the products from when the
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria are dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: This even brings up concerns with say
pasteurization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say you're drinking milk and you're not
really sure of the source it's from.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're lucky in Canada anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: America is similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have access to clean milk that's been
properly processed to avoid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that people don't understand is
even if that milk or whatever food product
[SPEAKER_06]: has been pasteurized, or treated and there
actually is no live bacteria, just having
[SPEAKER_06]: that bacterial DNA and the bacterial
byproducts can still cause an immune
[SPEAKER_06]: activation, cause inflammation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just live bacteria that can
interact with our body.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also the dead bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can think of bacteria again as like
good bacteria and bad bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the good bacteria interact through
these similar receptors.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting is they interact
through the same receptors, but they can
[SPEAKER_06]: tell our immune system to calm down and
chill out and everything's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's certain studies where
they're feeding people with immune
[SPEAKER_06]: disorders, certain types of bacteria that
can target these anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_06]: processes and actually get their
inflammation under control.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely essential when we think of
the bacteria we're using to feed our
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, our foods, because those bacteria
are getting into us, interacting with us
[SPEAKER_06]: and either providing beneficial or harmful
effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all very holistic, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Very holistic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of the as above, so below thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the idea of recreating the
perfect soil through teaming with
[SPEAKER_11]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what you're saying there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think of it and even imagine it
like that, the bacteria living on you,
[SPEAKER_06]: you are their planet and are you a good
planet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you feeding them good food?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you encouraging good bacteria to grow?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you feeding them bad food or bad
lifestyle practices or are you
[SPEAKER_06]: overstressed or are you overtired?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Todd McCormick talked a lot about
it when he was doing his plants and
[SPEAKER_06]: learning how to feed and plant nutrition
and soil issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was realizing that, hey, I'm giving my
plant the best vitamins and the best
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I do that for myself,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to think about that also.
[SPEAKER_11]: It also kind of goes then further to that
whole secret life plants thing,
[SPEAKER_11]: the fact that we have them plants or even
to that Michael Pollan coalition thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much the plants are having an effect
on us.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just how the plants are having an
effect on us, but how the plants that are
[SPEAKER_11]: made available through the microisole
network connecting the world and then the
[SPEAKER_11]: microbes that are almost inhabiting all
these different plants that we choose to
[SPEAKER_11]: take or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like how much of us is us,
how much of us are microbes that we're
[SPEAKER_11]: consuming from the other plants that we
choose to eat or from living a life that's
[SPEAKER_11]: sterile and just being on and off serious
antibiotics all the time and being a
[SPEAKER_11]: product of a factory farm human system of
eating processed shit and tons of sugar
[SPEAKER_11]: and killing off all your microbiome and
then just repeatedly being almost dull and
[SPEAKER_11]: droned out, just further consuming,
being a product of a system of
[SPEAKER_11]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of poop, have you seen the
research and the studies about people who
[SPEAKER_06]: are exposed to cat poop are exposed to a
certain type of pathogen?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can actually affect your mood,
your behavior.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats are necessary for the breeding
cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can make rats more, which are a natural
enemy, it can make the rats want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: friends with the cats.
[SPEAKER_11]: The virus gets to rats.
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes the rats more impulsive and just
like walking right up to a cat,
[SPEAKER_11]: the cat will eat it, the cat will get the
virus and then the cats give it to humans
[SPEAKER_11]: from interaction and kind of the other
species and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: The original source is cats though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked into it one time because there's
also this, sorry, what's the pathogen
called again?
[SPEAKER_11]: The original vector is cats to us,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's mice to cats.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the cats, there's something specific
about the cat and how the pathogen breeds
[SPEAKER_06]: in the cat because I went down a rabbit
hole looking at it because it's also an
[SPEAKER_06]: issue with certain types of meat and can
be contaminated on other animals and I
[SPEAKER_06]: know Joe Rogan was tweeting about it and I
was like it's not just cats and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: looked into it and for some reason the
cats actually are essential to their
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding cycle of the pathogen.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's what's crazy too is it feeds
into that old cat lady thing or old cat
[SPEAKER_11]: dude because it's like if you are in and
around cats all the time and they actually
[SPEAKER_11]: say one in four people or something like
that in Europe, in the European Union have
[SPEAKER_11]: toxoplasmosis and it very markedly shifts
people's behavior in certain ways to
[SPEAKER_11]: become more reckless and impulsive and
higher propensity to become addicted to
[SPEAKER_11]: gambling and certain things like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the podcast I just sent about
listen to Talking Dirty about spiritual
[SPEAKER_11]: plants and microbial biodiversity,
they kind of get into, I mean it's the
[SPEAKER_11]: first time I'd ever heard it but this
neurologist is getting into viruses and
[SPEAKER_11]: parasites and how viruses and parasites
also in certain ways aren't all bad but
[SPEAKER_11]: have certain other weird kind of down
trail or downstream kind of beneficial
[SPEAKER_11]: effects.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't really know what possibly could
be beneficial about toxoplasmosis but they
[SPEAKER_11]: get into basically these different types
of viruses that similarly I guess have
[SPEAKER_11]: some type of weird symbiotic relationship
where they kind of come and take over the
[SPEAKER_11]: host or impact us and people have them but
then there is also some other weird
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting kind of effects from them that
are beneficial I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also it's a lot different in people with
suppressed immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a strong immune system you can pretty
much ignore it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have suppressed immune system it
can be very, very, very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well and that's actually why, and that's a
really awesome segue I think Sam,
[SPEAKER_11]: because everybody's freaked out about
microbes on cannabis and it's like which
[SPEAKER_11]: ones are good, which ones are bad and
should we regulate all of them?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really happy to see kind of
California becoming more educated in how
[SPEAKER_11]: they're approaching targeting what
microbes to test for because when you're
[SPEAKER_11]: just testing for total aerobic bacteria,
total yeast and mold, certain things that
[SPEAKER_11]: are more like indicator microorganisms of
things like shelf life and quality and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff like that, I mean it would be very
almost ignorant to kind of over-regulate
[SPEAKER_11]: those because we come in contact with
those every day from foods we eat and the
[SPEAKER_11]: different things we're interacting with in
our environment and microbes are
[SPEAKER_11]: ubiquitous in our environment so it's like
what microbes are bad but then I think
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a really important thing to
distinguish is okay, well for your average
[SPEAKER_11]: person that has a semi-quasi strong or
relatively strong microbiome in their gut,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, the presence of kind of any foreign
invader that even is potentially
[SPEAKER_11]: pathogenic, can oftentimes get crushed out
by this army of microbes that are in your
[SPEAKER_11]: gut ready to just wage war against
anything bad but such a quite distinct
[SPEAKER_11]: different situation whenever somebody's
undergone chemo and radiation and series
[SPEAKER_11]: after series of antibiotics and they have
no stomach microbiota essentially and so
[SPEAKER_11]: those types of patients should almost
choose their cannabis medicine based more
[SPEAKER_11]: off sterility than they should anything
else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether that's taste or flavor or kind of
terpene, I mean almost just in a certain
[SPEAKER_11]: capacity for safety because yeah,
and that's the difference I try to
[SPEAKER_11]: distinguish is just people that are stage
four cancer, unless they're herbs
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially sterilized or tested and
you're very confident that it's very low
[SPEAKER_11]: CFU of anything or screened for mycotoxins
and all that stuff, they should choose
[SPEAKER_11]: more off these sterile extracts or
extracted oils that are standardized
[SPEAKER_11]: milligram dosed so that they can,
I mean because those types of patients are
[SPEAKER_11]: almost going to benefit more from that
type of treatment than this ordinary snake
[SPEAKER_11]: and herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not recommending, but bedder can makes
gamma ray sterilized material which lowers
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpenes, has no effect on the
cannabinoids but it does slightly lower
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, gamma radiation,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, is a patient, I mean sure if a
patient gets gamma irradiated weed that's
[SPEAKER_11]: slightly terp zapped and they're smoking
it but they have stage four cancer or
[SPEAKER_11]: something, I mean again, they should
probably be more trying to ramp up high
[SPEAKER_11]: dose milligram oils than thinking that
they're going to smoke like a 15% total
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoid bud in a joint and burn it and
then lose half of it or more from the
[SPEAKER_11]: combustion process.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the kind of thing I try to
differentiate oftentimes whenever I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: working with dispensaries to train their
bud tenders, it's like whenever you're
[SPEAKER_11]: assessing and working with a patient to
understand where they're at and what
[SPEAKER_11]: they're looking for and how deep of
illness or disease they have, it's
[SPEAKER_11]: important to help guide people to the
right type of thing and if somebody's
[SPEAKER_11]: looking for cannabis and they're trying to
kind of take on major kind of treatment of
[SPEAKER_11]: a disease, I mean you should almost kind
of educate them about the microbes and the
[SPEAKER_11]: micro thing, the microbiology thing
because even if it's just yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_11]: and aerobic bacteria, if somebody has no
immune system they probably shouldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They should choose another way of
ingesting it so where they can maximize
[SPEAKER_11]: the treatment and minimize the potential
pathogenic or harmful things that can be
[SPEAKER_11]: introduced to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind also as I was saying
before back with the pasteurization,
[SPEAKER_06]: same with if the plants are treated to
kill all the microbes, the DNA and the
[SPEAKER_06]: micro products are still there even though
the bacteria is dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you see the presence of dead microbes
but DNA on its own has a negative effect
[SPEAKER_11]: you're saying, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly and so if we're, sometimes I worry
about plant producers or growers thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: that they can still have a dirty product
and then just irradiate it at the end and
[SPEAKER_06]: then it's magically okay, like that's not
the case.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially for things like mycotoxins too
because they're like byproducts of certain
[SPEAKER_11]: pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not destroyed by gamma ray
sterilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: The organisms may be but not the
mycotoxins they produce.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these products almost have to go
through some type of or anything with
[SPEAKER_11]: these levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess to truly create a significant
medicinal standardized oil it would have
[SPEAKER_11]: to go through various steps of
post-processing to filter out and separate
[SPEAKER_11]: out potential mycotoxins or any other DNA.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean I guess you might not be able to
remove it all but you almost need to take
[SPEAKER_11]: that on in a certain capacity if you're
trying to create a product for the
[SPEAKER_11]: ultra-sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about when you're putting soil
microbes in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those just staying in the soil or are
the microbes coming up the plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: getting in the flowers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how is that working?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can anyone answer that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oftentimes compost teas and beneficial
microbes are used as bio-fungicides or
[SPEAKER_11]: bio-insecticides to spray on the foliage
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean if they're being sprayed to
full your application then yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: they're gonna inoculate all these
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna be present there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean they're not gonna necessarily
kind of come up with root drench or feed
[SPEAKER_11]: the inner part of the plant or I guess the
roots of the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not gonna kind of yeah,
systemically kind of transfer.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if to not use systemic fungicides
you're using kind of biological inoculants
[SPEAKER_11]: and so most people are using at least in
veg or very, very, very, very beginning of
[SPEAKER_11]: flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: People will still kind of spray things
like Actinovate or Forage which are
[SPEAKER_11]: strepulomyces, beneficial fungus or BT or
BS or different types of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the rhizobacterias will stay on the
root and then there's certain types of
[SPEAKER_11]: strains that will encumber the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: But rhizobacterias they just call it
colonize and grow on the root itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And bravo with what you said man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right on point with so many great
things.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to listen to you brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you've been going off hard today
Alec.
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say as well I've been really
enjoying everything that you've shared so
[SPEAKER_09]: far.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a beautiful honor to be in this
group of amazing mentors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the hats he wears are too
straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Alec is super straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time he was on Hash Church he was
like snuffing at Pina or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good conversation guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone in the chat is absolutely
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was someone that asked a question to
you Sam and I don't know if I can find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something about what did you mean
by needing a thousand plants to preserve
[SPEAKER_09]: genetic diversity?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well if you're trying to save a land
race then you have one or two plants
[SPEAKER_04]: picked out of it and you reproduce it in a
closet under a light.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you're doing is you're reproducing a
couple of plants from the variety because
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to keep all of the traits and
save all of the genes in that land race
[SPEAKER_04]: variety you need at least a thousand
females and a thousand males.
[SPEAKER_04]: A higher count is better but at least if
you have two thousand plants you're
[SPEAKER_04]: preserving 99.9 or some ridiculously high
amount percent of the genes are conserved
[SPEAKER_04]: each time you reproduce the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about the genetic
expression so when people who are watching
[SPEAKER_02]: this when you get a pack of seeds you'll
notice that you get a different expression
[SPEAKER_02]: of genetics in those individual seeds even
if they're from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what we're talking about
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The land race and the plants are not
identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a soup of genes that are compatible
and work together and are reproducible as
[SPEAKER_04]: a collective whole but when you start
breaking off little pieces of reproducing
[SPEAKER_04]: it, it doesn't have everything that the
big soup has.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know something pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got back from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was up in Oregon for the past week and
there's this big issue that you know I
[SPEAKER_11]: mean people have been talking about for a
long time that things just about to like
[SPEAKER_11]: really popping it all over you know in
California too but you know all these
[SPEAKER_11]: producers who were growing in greenhouse
and outdoor you know are essentially
[SPEAKER_11]: getting seeded pretty hard by the or
southern Oregon hemp farms and so you have
[SPEAKER_11]: all these like really chronic kind of you
know senesemia strains that people have
[SPEAKER_11]: been breeding and working with bring out
THC and to create these really high turf
[SPEAKER_11]: profile strains and they're essentially
getting dusted by these feral hemp type
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivars you know which I think you know
which people are super super chapped about
[SPEAKER_11]: but I think it's really fascinating
because you know it's almost like you know
[SPEAKER_11]: again through that like idea of the you
know I guess like a botany desire or
[SPEAKER_11]: something you know it's like the plant
itself is kind of almost through this
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting kind of open pollination
project you know it's gonna be like
[SPEAKER_11]: reseeding all these high THC cultivars you
know with novel kind of change because so
[SPEAKER_11]: much in the hat is I think so many of the
minor cannabinoids and you know even
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting really unique terpenes so much
are also locked up in the in the hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: stock or the feral kind of cannabis stock
and then also in and you know you know
[SPEAKER_11]: rare land race kind of you know cultivars
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: On another note how fucking awesome is
your compost hat straight out of compost.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like Sam this is a little harder for
you bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: That hat is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a play on the Compton hat.
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you who don't know and that
is really really well played.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: My friends of Biologic Systems who are
kind of proteges of Elaine Ingham kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: make this hat I'll totally dial you guys
out with some if you like.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm definitely going to wear the compost
hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like the Michael Jackson of hat,
lid wardrobe changes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just did that because Sam was making fun
of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah he has a super trippy hat on.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like yeah your hats are too straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then someone in the chat is like
they're flat pills.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're supposed to be straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like no dude he means like Joe Stratey
like not trippy.
[SPEAKER_11]: If any of you are at the Emerald Cup I'll
gather a bunch of these and I'll give you
[SPEAKER_11]: the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome thanks Alec.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll need one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compost on our head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah dude that's that's the shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude probiotic hair washes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No that's really great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some great hats but I don't have one
that great.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great hat dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_09]: So did today's conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everyone for rocking a crazy
hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've almost been going for three hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to continue going if we have
things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to bring up another study.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys talked about it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a new human trial double blind
placebo controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: With oral cannabidiol CBD looking at its
effect on anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they used healthy people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't read the whole trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw people tweeting about it and
saying like oh CBD is so overrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the biggest placebo ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like kind of you know trolling CBD
medicine for anxiety anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some issues with the study is they
looked at healthy people and so they found
[SPEAKER_06]: no effect and the doses they were giving
were 300 milligrams 600 milligrams or 900
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams compared to no CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the trial design was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think spray or oral.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was oral.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to read the whole trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll post it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just came out or it came to my
attention just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I haven't had a chance to read the
whole thing yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just curious what people think.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if they repeated the trial
with people who actually had anxiety if
[SPEAKER_06]: they would show the benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did these different tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not totally familiar with the tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just from the abstract what I got is
they're tests where it's like to evoke
[SPEAKER_06]: stress and anxiety in a normal person and
then they kind of test your responses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're looking to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind this is a clinical test
so they're trying to make comparisons so
[SPEAKER_06]: they can say yes it works or yes it not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is still a contrived type of
experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they basically put a bunch of weed in
the trunk of your car dump turps on you
[SPEAKER_09]: and send you through roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that how it's.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I think it's kind of bullshit
is because they did another study with 300
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams oral and they looked at people
and they put them actually in a test of
[SPEAKER_06]: social anxiety where they had to public
speak just in front of the group.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that was a better test of an
anxiety situation because most people are
[SPEAKER_06]: terrified of public speaking where this
one they kind of exposed them to some
[SPEAKER_06]: imagery and it looked like they kind of
measured like eye movements and things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just wondering if they repeated it
with people with actual anxiety or
[SPEAKER_06]: different tests if they would see an
effect and maybe they're just showing hey
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD doesn't alter your baseline responses
in a normal healthy person.
[SPEAKER_06]: So wouldn't that be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah so a lot of people were just
saying oh CBD for anxiety that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe that to be true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on what your anxiety is caused
by.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's caused by too much too fast THC
then CBD is effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: For other things I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I mean I have two things come to
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that this drive for CBD only I
don't even understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean for science yeah let's keep looking
at it but animal studies human trials
[SPEAKER_02]: everything has shown that CBD by itself is
not as effective as CBD in balance with
[SPEAKER_02]: other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know you have this drive to try
this high CBD on people who you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to induce anxiety from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would think that someone who has
endocannabinoid regulatory issue
[SPEAKER_02]: chronically where it causes long term
consequences that may be inducing panic
[SPEAKER_02]: attacks or mood shifts is going to
interact differently than somebody with a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy functioning endocannabinoid system
where you just try to induce stress for
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who has a healthy functioning
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why that would seem
like it would correlate when we know
[SPEAKER_02]: enough about the endocannabinoid system
endocannabinoid deficiency disorders and
[SPEAKER_02]: how some of these cannabinoids interact
with it and assume that those are
[SPEAKER_02]: interchangeable because it doesn't seem
like it would be to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not surprised at the results.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and I totally agree with you that CBD
alone like let's evolve past that because
[SPEAKER_06]: we all know it works better with even
small amounts of THC with even little bits
[SPEAKER_06]: of other terpenes or I'm assuming other
compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works best with other compounds and I
know that especially from the work that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've looked into with Crohn's and colitis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean they just came out with a study
with 10 milligrams of CBD only orally for
[SPEAKER_06]: patients with Crohn's disease and showed
that it wasn't helpful which isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: surprising because a lot of the patients
are using THC and CBD in a one-to-one and
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally agree with you Forrest and I
mean I've seen Bonnie Goldstein do many
[SPEAKER_06]: talks on her patient population and same
thing that's the thing that people don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to know is kids also need THC with
some of these patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean every study has shown that take and
let's just stick with peer-reviewed or
[SPEAKER_02]: double-blind studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Epidiolex study that GW
Pharmaceuticals did on Lennox-Gastaut and
[SPEAKER_02]: Gervais syndrome kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the doctors coming back to it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is not as effective as you parents
said it was but none of us were using
[SPEAKER_02]: purified CBD and they looked at a clinical
dose in those studies as around 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams per kilogram right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: of CBD before they saw any efficacy and I
was speaking to the head of pediatric
[SPEAKER_02]: neurology at UCSF and he's like we'll see
this that's what you need to do and CBD is
[SPEAKER_02]: not as effective as we thought and I had
to tell him I'm sorry doc but you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: years behind you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having those results because you're
using CBD isolate essentially and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't work that way you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have THC and the other
cannabinoids in there that interact with
[SPEAKER_02]: the receptors differently than CBD does
and that's why we're using 10 and 20
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram doses for some people seeing
more efficacy than you're having at 500
[SPEAKER_02]: and 700 milligram doses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well that and that's what I really really
love kind of about this plant is it almost
[SPEAKER_11]: seems like it's unpharmaceuticalizable and
it's certain to a certain level you know
[SPEAKER_11]: because like because there's so many
people that think that the move is to you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of like and it's weird because
like there's a high demand right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why people are paying for it
but a lot of people are creating these
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of white powders or crystallites you
know so they're like refining fractionally
[SPEAKER_11]: distilling THCA and they are this THCA
crystal and it looks like a drug it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: straight white powder and then people have
the white distillate.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't distill THCA.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't distill THCA.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well not distill not distill excuse me I
mean well whatever it is they're doing
[SPEAKER_11]: like you know ethanol and kind of like you
know kind of doing some type of
[SPEAKER_11]: distillation or maybe not distillation
distillation with heat I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A recrystallization from an extraction
yeah or doing it by the rosin method or
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well I just mean like yeah and yeah excuse
me it's like I'm wrong in how it's being
[SPEAKER_11]: extracted but they're making the like 98
99% THCA crystal or you what have you or
[SPEAKER_11]: they're making kind of you know the CBD
that's you know full.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: The chemist in me is excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean you're taking the active ingredient
from the plant and you're purifying it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean that's heroic and champion for a
whole different level.
[SPEAKER_11]: No it is it is it is and I'm not trying to
necessarily knock on it but I think and I
[SPEAKER_11]: think I think it's very unique and
interesting and novel to be able to take
[SPEAKER_11]: that and then you know kind of combine it
in unique amounts and ratios to really you
[SPEAKER_11]: know in some capacity you know nail some
type of some type of you know because
[SPEAKER_11]: that's that's what doctors are missing and
research university are missing or the
[SPEAKER_11]: standardized to you know but if you think
you're going to get it and have an
[SPEAKER_11]: efficacy just by using one single molecule
isolated compound you know it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: exciting to me that it's not working in so
many of these ways and and you know it's
[SPEAKER_11]: having such low efficacy in comparison to
even just having you know you know a tenth
[SPEAKER_11]: amount or 20th the amount of you know a
minor compound in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's face it THCA is the Pavarotti in
front of this orchestra of other compounds
[SPEAKER_08]: and the orchestra of other compounds or
flavonoids terpenes other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_08]: other but the star of the show is THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry that's just the way it is with this
plant right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay now some plants don't make THCA
because they have another synthase that
[SPEAKER_08]: helps them make CVDA you know we talked
about those earlier hemp varieties low THC
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties but yeah I mean THCA is the star
of the show so everything else sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: surrounds it in kind of like a symphony
and we were talking before I love using
[SPEAKER_08]: the symphony analogy because so so
important because you might hear you know
[SPEAKER_08]: the trumpet and you might hear one or two
elements of the brass but then there's the
[SPEAKER_08]: whole undertone of the brass which brings
the whole level of the orchestra up to a
[SPEAKER_08]: whole different level that wouldn't be
there if you were just listening to a
[SPEAKER_08]: trumpet and a trombone player like a small
group jazz which I told and that's why
[SPEAKER_08]: like ensemble or symphony is almost better
than entourage you know absolutely the
[SPEAKER_08]: ensemble effect because they all work
together in creating this overall
[SPEAKER_08]: fragrance or essence that you know
attracts humans but make no bones about it
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not just you know how you grow it and
whether it's indoors whether it's
[SPEAKER_08]: sun-grown outdoors roots in the ground
outdoors is different than roots in a pot
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoors everything makes a difference
because as you very nicely point out we
[SPEAKER_08]: live in a microbial world like it or not
we're just microbes everywhere on our
[SPEAKER_08]: plants on us everywhere everywhere
everywhere hey I wanted to also just throw
[SPEAKER_08]: a wrench in the works you know that whole
number of how many bugs are on us I've
[SPEAKER_08]: heard that sort of ten to one there's ten
to one microbial cells for every human so
[SPEAKER_08]: that thing is more like about one to one
folks it really really is so there's more
[SPEAKER_08]: recent studies that show it's about one
point one to one point nine to one so it's
[SPEAKER_08]: really close to one to one in terms of
microbial mass and your human body mass so
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not ten to one as was previously
thought what if you smoke weed every day I
[SPEAKER_08]: was just gonna say this is the exception
for those of us who are full of shit when
[SPEAKER_04]: we lived in caves I'm sure it was more
like ten to one they're talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: cells bacteria within the human body it's
like a ratio of ten to one it's definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: been overestimated that ten to one because
when I started my grad school program and
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in a bacteria expert lab like
leading the way with told like receptor
[SPEAKER_06]: research we were all saying ten to one ten
to one and by the end we were toning down
[SPEAKER_06]: because yeah it was overestimated it's
still a significant amount but ten to one
[SPEAKER_03]: is not the appropriate number I think the
take-home point is that there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant amount I mean whether we're
saying ten to one or one to one it really
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't change the point that there's a
huge interaction between the microbiome
[SPEAKER_11]: and the body that's all I was saying 2016
you know and we're just beginning to
[SPEAKER_11]: actually fully realize and understand the
human microbiome you know I mean that's
[SPEAKER_11]: when we started it in 2016 is when they
started I believe 2015-16 when they began
[SPEAKER_11]: the human microbiome initiative and that's
just when they started it yeah I mean new
[SPEAKER_11]: it's so new that this data is trailblazing
right now yeah like how lucky are we that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can actually sit here and debate
whether it's the ensemble effect or the
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage effect or like if it's ten to
one or one to one I mean we've come a long
[SPEAKER_03]: way and we've got a lot of knowledge and I
think that you know sharing that knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: is the important getting stuck up on the
semantics of is son is ensemble versus
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage really like much better I mean
to me those points are kind of but so I
[SPEAKER_02]: have you guys looked into the report Dr.
Russo put out this week another chapter in
[SPEAKER_02]: the entourage or ensemble effect cannabis
pharmacology the usual suspects few
[SPEAKER_03]: promising leads yeah that's a paper he
published with Jehan Marku that was just
[SPEAKER_03]: published what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a book chapter it's not a paper yeah
it's the chapter but it's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacology it's on PubMed usual suspects
and a few promising leads read the
[SPEAKER_02]: abstract they haven't bought the rest of
it yet but has anyone checked it out yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I haven't I didn't I saw I read the
abstract I didn't even try to look for it
[SPEAKER_04]: on PsyLab I got it a couple months ago on
reddit I liked it usually those
[SPEAKER_03]: publications aren't shared around when
they're chapters from a book they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: as easily accessible unless you're Sam
yeah it's 30 bucks not too bad luckily
[SPEAKER_03]: you're in Sam it's not it's not the 30
bucks for me it's that like that's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: a thousand articles I'm always looking for
right so I look I don't look at it the
[SPEAKER_03]: same as just 30 bucks it's like it's like
is this another one that I want to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah another one that came out just to put
on everyone's radar if you're working with
[SPEAKER_02]: patients is a new study on interactions
between cannabidiol and commonly used
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-epileptic drugs so who are working
with people coming in for seizures and
[SPEAKER_02]: spasms but it's really critical that we've
known for a long time how cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_02]: working on cytochrome what is it P450
affects the metabolism of certain
[SPEAKER_02]: benzodiazepines like clozam and omphi but
now they have a list of like six other
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs that they've shown that it interacts
the drug levels in the body so something
[SPEAKER_11]: to look for if you're working with
patients for sure that just came out
[SPEAKER_11]: earlier this week for us do you see this
is random quick question do you see the
[SPEAKER_11]: benefit of ketogenic diet a lot with the
epileptic kids or patients that you work
[SPEAKER_02]: with yeah certain times I mean you're just
it's all about changing brain chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so kind of with with those families
certain adults or kids or anyone dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with those sort of things and I think
that's too much focus well is that a
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence that they too heavily focus on
those sort of things but just epilepsy I
[SPEAKER_02]: think any neurological sort of condition
albeit depression or other things we see
[SPEAKER_02]: it affected with with diet because you're
changing the chemistry in the body but
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we go through all diets and
supplements cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_02]: phytocannabinoid supplements are really
where we aim for those kids and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you just you get lucky with some and not
with others they're all individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also for those who are curious
there's the ketogenic diet is a high
[SPEAKER_02]: protein high fats diet then there's the
gaps diet and modified atkins all three of
[SPEAKER_02]: those kind of create different effects and
they can all be really beneficial they're
[SPEAKER_11]: all similar in low carb right low
processed grain low kind of bean and
[SPEAKER_11]: legume all that stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah
and then you know maybe maybe this is also
[SPEAKER_11]: a you know topic I guess for another
conversation I don't know if it seems like
[SPEAKER_11]: it's probably kind of wrapping up but I
would really love at some point to like
[SPEAKER_11]: have a deep hash church dive into kind of
the you know like almost inviting like you
[SPEAKER_11]: know maybe like Mark Lewis Mike Baucus you
know and then maybe some of the genetic
[SPEAKER_11]: dudes like the phyllo skies or Modesto
Genetics guys I mean it'd be kind of a
[SPEAKER_11]: royal rumble you know of a hash church but
I think I mean you know there's you know
[SPEAKER_11]: just with that that recent kind of article
that came out the great pot monopoly you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of all around the you know you
know the utility patent reality of some of
[SPEAKER_11]: the type 2 stuff happening you know and
then you know on the on the other end then
[SPEAKER_11]: you have like the people and the genetic
testing realm of the world that are you
[SPEAKER_11]: know seeking to kind of sequence and they
claim to you know open source a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff but you know I just have a lot of
questions about the potential of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: data aggregating genetic data in the
future you know of all this information
[SPEAKER_11]: that's being given out just you know you
know to you know from all these breeding
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions across the world to all the you
know to these companies that are you know
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of eventually have a lot of power to
aggregate and like look at and notice
[SPEAKER_11]: unique interesting things about the
genetics of the plan just whether or not
[SPEAKER_11]: it's all like malevolent or benevolent you
know and you know I just think it's a
[SPEAKER_11]: really fascinating topic that most people
don't really understand and so since we
[SPEAKER_11]: don't understand it we almost take it
offensively I think it's not either
[SPEAKER_03]: malevolent or benevolent it's just the way
it is it's business and this is now that
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis is in the world which is major
like philosophical like kind of ethical
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation you know yeah I agree with
you but I had this conversation with Magli
[SPEAKER_03]: this week I spent an hour on the phone
with him talking about it and I'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: wrap the up line I think part of this is
that you know these grievances that people
[SPEAKER_03]: have towards the way this shit is playing
out are not grievances they have actually
[SPEAKER_03]: towards a given company or set of
individuals that are carrying out the way
[SPEAKER_03]: normal business does normal business
really if you have gripes with utility
[SPEAKER_03]: patents then you need to talk to the
utility patent officer the people in
[SPEAKER_03]: America or the courts and change the way
that the USPTO works which isn't gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: happen well but that's but that's the
thing though and it's like to take that
[SPEAKER_03]: hatred that you have or that lack of
respect that you have for a system and
[SPEAKER_03]: then put it on the shoulders of one group
that is operating within the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanism of the system I think is
misplaced no I and I agree with that you
[SPEAKER_11]: know and it's interesting because I I have
you know I I'm like this I have this like
[SPEAKER_11]: Switzerland type thing I'm trying to
represent you know in in not you know
[SPEAKER_11]: because I don't understand really too much
of the either side I understand you know
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty vastly the implications of the the
utility patents you know you know and and
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you know I have a lot of qualms
with it on its own you know just you know
[SPEAKER_11]: philosophically blah blah blah but then on
top of that you know then like there's
[SPEAKER_11]: there's the the claims you know purpose
and service of the genetic testing
[SPEAKER_11]: services that are sequencing the cannabis
genome and and they're also going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: bombs and concerns with that too hey
listen they're doing bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_03]: screening it says it pretty much right in
there yeah your your your contract that
[SPEAKER_03]: you sign when you submit a sample and you
know it's not like let's be honest it's no
[SPEAKER_03]: different from SC labs I mean SC labs gets
to sample the market from a chemical basis
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get to see things before anybody
else even knows they're going on well but
[SPEAKER_11]: but but if we're but if we're a specific
third-party testing laboratory that
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't have holdings and genetic
development or like you know R&D or you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of creating genetics or kind of
making products you know and and and also
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like a very limited fingerprint of
what we're getting you know the key no no
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear you I'm just saying I'm just like
what could be pulled out bioinformatically
[SPEAKER_11]: from you know long snip sequencing or from
whatever let me tell you the honest truth
[SPEAKER_04]: it has a huge value you could say look it
here's a plant that has lots of THC no CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: has lots of and it has pining and phytol I
mean there's a lot of value that and not
[SPEAKER_04]: to you at this moment but there will be
people to who that will be a goldmine
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're looking for particular
things yeah and let me let me say
[SPEAKER_03]: something else Alec on that point I mean
listen this is the same thing that happens
[SPEAKER_03]: with with big business like Monsanto but
I'm not saying that you're Monsanto but
[SPEAKER_03]: what I am saying is that you guys are
collecting data and I mean we can take
[SPEAKER_03]: this one end of the spectrum that you grow
old and when you're 70 you pass the the
[SPEAKER_03]: business down to your children or
potentially you get bought out right and
[SPEAKER_03]: so all that data gets bought out too right
and these are just things that happen in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world of real business right it's like
there's consequences when we start
[SPEAKER_03]: providing a service and collecting data I
mean Google makes all their money on
[SPEAKER_03]: analytics right like that's the whole
point it's just like you you get to access
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole bunch of people search data and
you understand what they like and what
[SPEAKER_03]: they want and then from that you can make
decisions based on their on what you can
[SPEAKER_03]: market to them right so it's really no
different you know in all of these
[SPEAKER_11]: perspectives right well well well I mean
so I mean I mean I kind of I kind of see
[SPEAKER_11]: what you're talking about to a certain
point but whenever you know with 98
[SPEAKER_11]: percent predictability anything that we
test having one of three or four primary
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes an additional like two or three
or you know secondary sesquiterpene or you
[SPEAKER_11]: know you know whatever you know it's you
know most everything that comes through I
[SPEAKER_11]: mean yeah there are these you know 1%
outliers that have really rare unique kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of certain primary terpenes that never
really show up in any significant
[SPEAKER_11]: statistical amount but you know most
everything kind of falls into this range
[SPEAKER_11]: of you know what's there but you know
we're talking about you know one typically
[SPEAKER_11]: one primary cannabinoid THDA and then like
you know that's why data are important
[SPEAKER_04]: because you want to sit through it to find
those little tiny lakes of gold well I
[SPEAKER_11]: mean like our whole like you know kind of
vision for that is the how exciting of a
[SPEAKER_11]: tool that is then to help people that are
breeding and focusing on genetics to
[SPEAKER_11]: identify what on the rainbow what on the
rainbow of uniqueness do they have and
[SPEAKER_11]: what can they fill in and then from there
what unique combinations can they breed
[SPEAKER_11]: out through combining this one from this
side of the rainbow to this one through
[SPEAKER_11]: breeding people can you know start to fill
in the holes where you know maybe a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: the eradication kind of has happened over
the last you know hundred years that might
[SPEAKER_11]: have gotten rid of all a lot of the unique
interesting stuff but it's all for the
[SPEAKER_11]: purpose of further being able to pull out
and breed out and kind of bring about the
[SPEAKER_11]: diversity that the plan has but but and
then and then just real quick then you
[SPEAKER_11]: know because because I'm like in my
opinion that's a you know that's a small
[SPEAKER_11]: amount of information you know but it's a
lot of ability to help kind of you know
[SPEAKER_11]: the public value of data help drive a lot
of work kind of future breeding or my
[SPEAKER_11]: question is is how's you know because I
would think and maybe I'm just ignorant
[SPEAKER_11]: but I would think that that amount of data
is you know like you know on a certain
[SPEAKER_11]: level valuable yeah I feel you but but if
you're we're not taking and sequencing the
[SPEAKER_11]: entire genetic kind of expression of the
plant you know so that you know one day
[SPEAKER_11]: potentially we can notice unique really
trippy synthase genes or or certain
[SPEAKER_11]: environmental characteristics that might
help explain through reverse engineering
[SPEAKER_03]: certain Appalachian tendencies or quality
let me let me comment on that this and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the weakness of all those genetic
tests okay so when Mowgli was on here he
[SPEAKER_03]: said you know we're doing this open
cannabis product project and what we need
[SPEAKER_03]: is all the labs to donate their chemical
data right which made me laugh because
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially they're charged they're
charging for their service they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: giving it away for free and why should why
should SC labs right or anybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: that's in that team too the second thing
is that the genetic data on its own is
[SPEAKER_03]: completely useless without understanding
what bioinformatics yeah well no well you
[SPEAKER_03]: can do the bioinformatics but it's like
once you can't if you have the genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: data and you can't correlate it to a set
of traits so that you can start following
[SPEAKER_03]: those genetic markers and traits over
generations you can't tie them together
[SPEAKER_03]: right so there's an inherent flaw in only
accepting dispensary samples and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: do genetic work you have to have a
breeding program that goes along beside it
[SPEAKER_03]: so that you can understand how those
traits are inherited whether they're
[SPEAKER_03]: scored phenotypically or scored
chemotypically through a lab so say they
[SPEAKER_11]: get all that who are well no no I'm saying
I'm saying so so yeah so it seems like the
[SPEAKER_11]: chemo right NATO would be an incredible
important absolutely it's fully tied
[SPEAKER_11]: together some of the genetic reality the
story you can't have it's you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: the full story unless you have both pieces
well okay but what I mean but but what but
[SPEAKER_11]: if say if like over time any genetic
company were to collect thousands and
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands of chemo type data kind of
imprints to then overlap with you know the
[SPEAKER_11]: same genetic kind of stuff I mean what is
what can they come out with I mean what
[SPEAKER_11]: and and this is again this is more from a
space of ignorance than it is anything
[SPEAKER_11]: else because I'm like fuck dude I think
like my ultimate like dystopian view you
[SPEAKER_11]: know would be you know in the future you
have like some people that figured out how
[SPEAKER_11]: to fucking you know like bio hack the
plant and then like all of a sudden you
[SPEAKER_11]: know across the United States you have all
the pharmaceutical companies with fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: acres carved out of like insulin growing
cannabis through the trichomes or fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: opiates growing out of the trichomes of
cannabis plants you know or whatever and
[SPEAKER_11]: then I mean that's kind of a stupid kind
of a Terminator type trip reality of where
[SPEAKER_03]: it could go but I'm just not at all I mean
listen that's not a bad thing you remember
[SPEAKER_03]: the Ebola thing that went off crazy in
Africa or like about 18 months ago or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they were making they grew the
Ebola vaccine in tobacco okay it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's way faster to transfect tobacco than
it is to create a strain and start ramping
[SPEAKER_03]: it up in a bioreactor it's like it's
actually tobacco is one of the easiest
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to transform and you can put
proteins into it and grow them really
[SPEAKER_03]: quick and clone them up and then extract
them so the future is it yeah maybe there
[SPEAKER_11]: is like produces all kinds of
pharmaceutical drugs through the trichomes
[SPEAKER_11]: absolutely there's a guy I can't remember
if they do DMT would I be into it there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a guy on there's a TED talk and if you
give you go to Google and you search TED
[SPEAKER_03]: talks homo evolutis so like think homo
sapiens but homo evolutis so EVOLUTIS and
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially it's his argument is that
we're no longer homo sapiens we're now a
[SPEAKER_03]: different species that are instead of
altering the environment like we have done
[SPEAKER_03]: over the past 10,000 years we now alter
the genomes of the other organisms around
[SPEAKER_03]: us and ourselves is inevitably where it's
coming to but yeah CRISPR cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: coming soon there's already people working
on it and you know what cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually pretty special because there's
not many plants that produce 30% of that
[SPEAKER_03]: compound in a given you know like you said
an expression system like the trichomes so
[SPEAKER_03]: if we find out how to hijack it then you
know what we can actually use cannabis to
[SPEAKER_11]: produce all these different things well
who's hijacking it and then who is I mean
[SPEAKER_11]: and then so I guess what I mean and what
does that do the fucking Monsanto then?
[SPEAKER_03]: well I think again it's like that stupid
article it's like they you know they paint
[SPEAKER_11]: this image that it's Monsanto well no and
well you know well I'm wondering who's
[SPEAKER_11]: Monsanto the guys that the article is
talking about or the guys that put like
[SPEAKER_11]: the article in the ear of the journalist
you know man that's it's funny dude
[SPEAKER_11]: they're everybody I mean everybody's
Monsanto don't say that I'm not yeah they
[SPEAKER_03]: are because I mean in the article too they
talk about Ziggy right Ziggy and Jeff or
[SPEAKER_03]: in Jodri up in in Hemboldt and how they
said they'd patent their stuff too right
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's like everybody would do it if they
could but I think a lot of people are you
[SPEAKER_11]: know kind of don't fully understand you
know they're people just don't want their
[SPEAKER_11]: shit to get jacked you know and and a lot
of think a lot of people have okay but
[SPEAKER_11]: wait wait a second of the type two
non-miracent dominant strains somehow is
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna infringe on their development of
their genetics which it's not okay but
[SPEAKER_11]: what happens but real quick what happens
when what happens when all these THC
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivars or THCA cultivars that are grown
in Oregon are getting like and randomly
[SPEAKER_11]: accidentally seeded by this hemp stock
these hemp crops that are in southern
[SPEAKER_11]: Oregon and then like if they happen to
props pop some seeds you know all of a
[SPEAKER_11]: sudden what if they got like a turpentine
or like a limonene dominant type two
[SPEAKER_11]: accidentally from that is that now
infringing if you take it and you market
[SPEAKER_03]: it and intentionally because it's a
limonene dominant type two it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: accidentally pop up and just be dominant
in the field you might have one plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: way but it's not gonna happen now these
things are these things are the result of
[SPEAKER_03]: intentional breeding and it's kind of you
know probably biased but I kind of laugh
[SPEAKER_03]: at a little bit because it's like these
things really are innovations people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know they don't exist on the market so
it's like how can you sit there as a part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the community and say well it's unfair
that those guys did all that breeding work
[SPEAKER_11]: and develop something that I didn't do
well and it's disingenuous and it's also
[SPEAKER_11]: disingenuous to then try to sell a service
like trying to scare people that this
[SPEAKER_11]: patent is gonna crush their ability to
grow what they've grown all their life
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah and I mean I talked about this with
Mowgli and I talked about it with Kevin
[SPEAKER_03]: before and it's like it's like I said to
Mowgli this week it's I find it a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit disingenuous that these guys are
listen Mowgli and Kevin are super hyper
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent people and and and they're
good guys too like that I can sit like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really like both of them yeah yeah
so but I mean again they're coming into a
[SPEAKER_03]: game that some of us have been playing a
lot longer than they have and then
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially they're saying that weeds are
they're hella paranoid yeah what's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: there I mean dude we're rebels and people
like the whole the whole class of us are
[SPEAKER_03]: people that live on the edge of society so
we're untrusting of the government as it
[SPEAKER_03]: is right we're untrusting of big
corporations and anyhow I mean I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's like I do also agree with you I
feel it's a little bit disingenuous to be
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that they're essentially the
protectors of they're gonna save the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community from the big evil
corporations especially when like they
[SPEAKER_11]: have sponsored and promoted kind of like
Instagram and Facebook posts with the
[SPEAKER_11]: great pop monopoly on the pit on the as
the posting you know as a as a fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: like almost like a article to sell the
service you know and it's not and it's not
[SPEAKER_11]: drawing with distinction one way or
another good bad whatever I'm just again
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to just figure it out because I I
think attention matters a lot and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think a lot of people don't really
understand the whole reality of what's
[SPEAKER_11]: happening or or you know and I think
there's a lot of you know using fears of
[SPEAKER_11]: patents to like kind of you know just I
don't know yeah we listen we had a new
[SPEAKER_03]: Malgley on here I think it's pretty
obvious to anybody Malgley and Mark dude
[SPEAKER_03]: well Mark's not coming but Mowgli had a
you know I think it was pretty clear from
[SPEAKER_03]: the way he came on that he's Mowgli is an
idealist and he's a beautiful human being
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't think that there is any evil
intent in their work I think he truly
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to understand the molecular genetics
of cannabis in order to be able to exploit
[SPEAKER_03]: them or help other breeders exploit them I
mean that's clearly their business plan
[SPEAKER_03]: that's McKernan's business plan as well
too it's anybody's business plan that's
[SPEAKER_11]: worth them or let others exploit them or
help others exploit right exploitive terms
[SPEAKER_03]: well they're not what I mean exploit I
mean I mean express to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin's coming up with hands-on laboratory
diagnostics that look to be quite useful
[SPEAKER_08]: in the industry I don't see that happening
over in Mowgli's I don't know I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to get into that conversation I won for I
for one totally disagree with you they're
[SPEAKER_04]: both they're both in business they're both
in business smoke a joint and look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: galaxy yeah but listen they're both in
business they both are corporations
[SPEAKER_03]: they're both gonna find any way to take
the knowledge that they gained through
[SPEAKER_03]: their sequencing their sequencing for a
and find a way to turn profit about that I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean that's that's what they do right it's
the same thing that SC labs does and
[SPEAKER_03]: offering a service for the the lab service
that you guys offer and it's the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that I do and offering sees to the
market in Europe so I have a problem when
[SPEAKER_03]: people start pointing at the other guy's
stack and saying it's unfair that you did
[SPEAKER_03]: this to make that money those are you know
and and listen the reality is Alec that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about this dystopia it is
the future and I don't think it is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: dystopia I think that it's just these are
the tools that exist in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course those tools are going to be
used to investigate cannabis and of course
[SPEAKER_03]: people are going to take that information
that they glean from their experimentation
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're gonna try and find a way to
profit from it and and it's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_03]: on the filo side it's gonna happen on the
medicinal genomic side and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: happen on those guys that we're doing the
patent side so but if you look at those
[SPEAKER_03]: people I mean it's like people like
Michael Bacchus and he's not involved
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore but he was and you know he's the
guy's an industry leader so he's been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it for a long time I mean he's
straight up OG right so I have a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit of a hard time here's my first
connection I selling packs to whenever I
[SPEAKER_11]: first came into the cannabis community
they developed one of the first truly
[SPEAKER_03]: medical dispensaries in LA so I mean come
on so I have a hard time when these other
[SPEAKER_03]: guys join the game later say we're gonna
save the industry from these long-term
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not it's not Monsanto it's these are
like old school people that are probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the most advanced in the field right and
they get some super kick-ass work and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the community is gonna get pissed off
because they've created a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that nobody else has ever created before I
mean I just I can't I can't empathize with
[SPEAKER_03]: it you know what I mean and maybe I'm
biased and maybe it's some too into the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics to see it but you know what
that's we're in a different world folks
[SPEAKER_03]: it's no longer a bunch of hippies up on
the hill sharing medicine we're in a
[SPEAKER_03]: business where it can work cannabis is
legalized and in Canada it's not just you
[SPEAKER_03]: know we legalized like this in California
I mean we got big banks and investment
[SPEAKER_03]: banks throwing tens if not hundreds of
millions of dollars into these companies
[SPEAKER_03]: to do research and develop proprietary
methods and of course this is the type of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that is going to come out of those
forays so being scared of people
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting data on the genetics dude you
don't want it you don't want your DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: getting out the door that don't sell the
herb right because if you put the herb out
[SPEAKER_03]: the door I can collect it and take your
DNA or at least look at your DNA if I have
[SPEAKER_03]: the skills to do that right just like I
can if you give me a but I can take it to
[SPEAKER_03]: a lab and have the chemo type analyzed
also explain that if you let it out the
[SPEAKER_04]: door then you no longer have the right to
patent it if that's what you wanted to do
[SPEAKER_03]: well that that is true but I think that
the way that the patents and the thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that the people don't like about the
patents is you don't even have to let it
[SPEAKER_03]: at the door for these people to state
claims to these chemotypic classes right
[SPEAKER_11]: right and that's a trip that's a trip
because it's about showing that there
[SPEAKER_11]: hasn't been anything in existence at that
point right right but let's flip the
[SPEAKER_03]: script again for a second it's like this
kind of like me saying I want to develop a
[SPEAKER_03]: handheld device that sends email I can
watch YouTube make phone calls and text
[SPEAKER_03]: messages and store music and all these
kind of things and it's gonna have a
[SPEAKER_03]: touchscreen and blah blah blah and then I
turn around I say oh it's unfair that
[SPEAKER_03]: Google or Apple patented it right well
it's like I'm late to the game I came up
[SPEAKER_03]: with the idea too late right you don't see
people freaking out about oh this
[SPEAKER_03]: suppresses innovation no it doesn't
suppress innovation it suppresses
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation in the same field that you
they're innovating right that's the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: point they've developed these products
right so if you have a problem that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've gone ahead and develop these
products I don't know what to say like I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't buy the argument that I can't
compete right there's lots of room to
[SPEAKER_03]: innovate in cannabis and if you're gonna
be like a follower and you're gonna go
[SPEAKER_03]: around and try to do the same things that
other people have been done and then
[SPEAKER_03]: complain that they've patented or they've
they've secured IP property and in on
[SPEAKER_03]: those things I don't know I just I don't
buy it nice so but yeah it is the world's
[SPEAKER_03]: common man I mean if you let your flowers
at the door and these bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_03]: companies and the cost of sequence thing
is coming down down down down down every
[SPEAKER_03]: day so it's getting cheaper for them to do
the work um yeah they're gonna start
[SPEAKER_03]: screening and looking at traits in your
plant and you know trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: how they can they can benefit them and you
know what to me that's not a bad thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a great thing because we're gonna
have more tools upon which to improve the
[SPEAKER_03]: species that I love you know just like the
labs are the same thing I mean when I
[SPEAKER_03]: first start getting an access to a lab I
was able to make significant progress you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's a it's an incredible tool and
it's it's having access to that tool is
[SPEAKER_04]: not something terrible it's a dream yeah
not only do I agree with you but if you
[SPEAKER_04]: think of the arch types or super terpene
classes whatever you want to call them
[SPEAKER_04]: right once these all exist then they can
be given to different patients for
[SPEAKER_04]: different illnesses and we can find out
what helps what that much quicker right
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the future this is the future and
it's like the future is already here in
[SPEAKER_03]: corn and it's already here in wheat and
Mark Sheldon talked about this the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time I came on church I think it was
episode 66 or something but he said the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing you know like one day
biotechnology is gonna be this tool that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can do all these things that we do in
corn and wheat and soy and all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: crops and you know what that world
thankfully thank Jah that we live in a
[SPEAKER_03]: world where legalization exists and we as
farmers and breeders can actually access
[SPEAKER_03]: all that information you know to me I
think that that's incredible I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's something to be scared of the one
thing that I really got to hit home is
[SPEAKER_03]: this public domain commentary that art of
that article again painted this image that
[SPEAKER_03]: public domain is good you know nobody's
gonna be able to grow weed and we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be locked up by big business that is
absolute bullshit there alright good see
[SPEAKER_03]: that was part of my question there's
nothing true there there's nothing true
[SPEAKER_03]: there at all if it's documented in the
public domain and SC labs has been
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumental in documenting things in the
public domain by releasing that data out
[SPEAKER_03]: that you guys were releasing at one point
in time and probably hopefully will again
[SPEAKER_03]: the process of releasing the chemical data
onto the market and showing what exists
[SPEAKER_03]: like nobody can come and take blue dreams
nobody can come and take OG nobody can
[SPEAKER_03]: come and take anything other than the name
of gorilla glue floor for nobody nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: can take train wreck nobody can take Jack
Herrera right northern lights Afghani one
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk on and on and on and on these
varieties because they were taken by
[SPEAKER_03]: people by like Sam and you know other seed
breeders that released these things into
[SPEAKER_03]: the world that is the basis of the
chemical the the public domain and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what it's an incredibly strange
situation that we find ourselves in like
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no other plant in history that has
been sequestered and prevented from being
[SPEAKER_03]: like worked on like any other crop right
except for cannabis and everything was
[SPEAKER_03]: done underground and now it needs to find
its way into the public domain but what
[SPEAKER_03]: what what these labs are doing in
demonstrating that these chemotypes exists
[SPEAKER_03]: is they're proving the public domain
you're essentially scribes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: documenting what exists in the public
domain and anything that exists in the
[SPEAKER_03]: public domain can't be taken by another
group and patented you just can't do it
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the way the patent laws work so
that's a bit disingenuous something new
[SPEAKER_03]: with it like hydrogenated yeah or make
type two non-miracent dominant greater
[SPEAKER_03]: than one percent terpene plants I mean is
it right?
[SPEAKER_08]: well you can't do that you're reshuffling
the existing deck chairs and all these are
[SPEAKER_08]: common molecules that are already known so
I think my example points any direction
[SPEAKER_08]: it's that the plant has done heavy lifting
to make these molecules what can we do now
[SPEAKER_08]: to make them better to make them different
to make them you know what how can we take
[SPEAKER_08]: nature as an inspiration to make other new
molecules well listen you and I are
[SPEAKER_03]: completely in agreement but also
completely at loggerheads one because you
[SPEAKER_03]: look at it from a chemistry point of view
and I look at it from a biology genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: point of view so it puts us at different
vantage points but I think that we're all
[SPEAKER_04]: really saying the same thing you know when
you can get a plant that can produce 20%
[SPEAKER_04]: by weight of a target gee whizzikers and
you can you can aim it towards whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you want I mean THC that's obvious CBD you
can get more than 20% CBC CBG THCB CBDB
[SPEAKER_04]: all of these things you can get 10 20% 10
years ago I had the same discussion in
[SPEAKER_08]: regards to high oleic soybean oil and when
they saw levels of oleic acid exceeding
[SPEAKER_08]: 80% I'm like oh my god 80% oleic acid in
soybean oil what can we do with that oh my
[SPEAKER_08]: god it starts to look like yeah with
modern biotechnology we can do just about
[SPEAKER_08]: anything or teach plants to do just about
anything yeah but you know where plants
[SPEAKER_08]: leave off where biochemistry leaves off
that's where chemistry starts and as we
[SPEAKER_08]: know you know a big piece of the industry
as it exists today is is is concentrates
[SPEAKER_08]: and just to go back to analogies remember
that vineyards while they rely on good
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics and good grapes they don't sell
grapes they sell wine so how you make you
[SPEAKER_08]: know fruit of the vine work of human hand
to get biblical it's the work of the human
[SPEAKER_08]: hand where the value is and creating sort
of high quality cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_08]: craft products like you know single malt
scotch I think is you know with a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: you know the market today going towards
just sort of like a more generic thing
[SPEAKER_08]: there'll hopefully still be some value for
creating really high value you know whole
[SPEAKER_08]: plant extracts that have a lot of good
terpenes and everything that the plant all
[SPEAKER_04]: the heady goodness from the plant and as
far as I know flavonoids when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked have no effect but they the heat
destroys them it I know with oral
[SPEAKER_04]: flavonoids could be important have you
ever heard of anybody trying to take
[SPEAKER_04]: flavonoids with THC to understand how they
would modify it poorly or smoke they
[SPEAKER_08]: thermally degrade right they don't yeah I
don't think yeah well and I think and
[SPEAKER_11]: what's funny too is about most ingested or
infused products you know where most
[SPEAKER_11]: people decarboxylate their oils prior to
kind of infusing it into an edible you
[SPEAKER_11]: know it's like that you know and I think
we've been talked about this I'm here
[SPEAKER_11]: before but it's you know it's funny how
many products are labeled indica edible or
[SPEAKER_11]: sativa edible you know when in actuality
there's no terpenes or flavonoids
[SPEAKER_11]: remaining bingo the whole Canadian market
the same way it's hilarious nobody's
[SPEAKER_11]: nobody's like adding significant terpenes
to orally ingested kind of products that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been the thing that's hilarious is
that the market can't even that the market
[SPEAKER_03]: still thinks that they're bought that
there's a difference right oh I buy this
[SPEAKER_03]: people oil for the morning and I use the
indica oil for how much is placebo well
[SPEAKER_11]: and you and you know that that word that a
little paper that that really great paper
[SPEAKER_11]: that Adrian DeBetley and Martin Lee put
out through kind of O'Shaughnessy's
[SPEAKER_11]: project CBD about like mind over matter
over mind and it's about how the the
[SPEAKER_11]: belief in that treatment's gonna work
placebo or the non-relief treatment's not
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna work no SIBO you know in in
substantial ways across many different
[SPEAKER_11]: systems are also mediated or enhanced kind
of by the endocannabinoid system releasing
[SPEAKER_11]: off and firing off in certain ways certain
ways yeah yeah most I think most with
[SPEAKER_11]: edible dose has to do with I mean in you
know the how much is somebody taking on a
[SPEAKER_11]: full stomach empty stomach overactive
underactive immune system you know
[SPEAKER_11]: sedentary or active lifestyle we're just
so many different variables and how the
[SPEAKER_11]: same dose is gonna hit different people
yeah but yeah no um and and and so and to
[SPEAKER_11]: something you're saying just a little bit
ago chimera you know we so we we had this
[SPEAKER_11]: site on our or this this tab on our
website where it was said SCL tested and
[SPEAKER_11]: so anytime somebody paid it you know cuz
cuz anything tested with us is is the you
[SPEAKER_11]: know the ownership of the people that are
doing the testing and and so if they make
[SPEAKER_11]: up sample public then back in the day you
know it could be viewed if you just click
[SPEAKER_11]: on SC labs tested and I mean and you know
it can still be viewed regardless when
[SPEAKER_11]: people use QR codes or kind of labels or
you know do this or that you know you know
[SPEAKER_11]: because it'll take people to the page but
but we have since essentially taken away
[SPEAKER_11]: the SCL tested side of it because we found
out there was like three or four different
[SPEAKER_11]: groups that were basically like what do
you call it they were they were being
[SPEAKER_11]: scraped kiddies yeah they were there they
were they were mining your data yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: they're mining and yes scraping anything
that would go would be public and so so
[SPEAKER_11]: you know they were kind of like yeah in
their way like you know just like jacking
[SPEAKER_11]: pirating all our data you know and and
it's like and you know to a certain extent
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how valuable that data is
period because you know it's just showing
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of you know what's around but you
know no but again the question the thing
[SPEAKER_03]: is is and I got to put it back to you in
this in this context when you release
[SPEAKER_03]: something into the public domain it
becomes available for all to use so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's again if you guys are gonna make the
choice to release that information out
[SPEAKER_03]: there or the or your clients are making
that choice by clicking the box or
[SPEAKER_03]: checking the box we have to be aware that
there's gonna people that are gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: aggregate that data and they're gonna use
that data to do analysis and try to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand trends and find norms and find
unique things yeah the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_08]: taping policy right the Grateful Dead
taping policy was not like the favorite
[SPEAKER_08]: child of the record industry which says
look if you're trying to set records you
[SPEAKER_08]: shouldn't let people come to your concerts
and tape you but by people coming to the
[SPEAKER_08]: concerts and taping them all that
information got out and all the tape
[SPEAKER_08]: trading and the whole Grateful Dead
culture grew because they had this taping
[SPEAKER_08]: thing so it's kind of like again putting
stuff out in the open domain Garcia used
[SPEAKER_08]: to say hey man when we're done playing
with it they can have it you know like
[SPEAKER_08]: they've already played those notes and
it's not really cool yeah I got to point
[SPEAKER_03]: out the big difference there is that that
was an art and there is a business of
[SPEAKER_03]: science and cannabis and if you if you
fail to recognize that then you're missing
[SPEAKER_09]: the whole point no listen it's just like
anything you can choose to give it away or
[SPEAKER_09]: you can choose to keep it that doesn't
matter what you're involved in Elon Musk
[SPEAKER_09]: gave his patents away billions of dollars
in value because no no that's the let's
[SPEAKER_03]: let's be honest he gave some patents away
and he gave some away sure but he kept
[SPEAKER_03]: away but he also kept a bunch for himself
right and it's in it's a business decision
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean and it's it's listen it's whoever
fucking collects and makes the data's
[SPEAKER_03]: decision to do that on their own I mean
why are you gonna why are you gonna go
[SPEAKER_03]: spend a bunch of time figuring something
out for a business purpose and then give
[SPEAKER_03]: it away for free to everybody else that
makes no sense I mean Alec you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna come up to Canada and teach us how
to set up a lab with your protocols and
[SPEAKER_09]: your everything yeah it does happen but
I'm just saying it's a difference in
[SPEAKER_03]: business style and I think that it's also
one that's like it's heavily argued by the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that aren't doing this type of work
I mean everybody was hey man I really like
[SPEAKER_03]: that shirt that you wear why don't you
make me one of those shirts or like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know like I don't know I again I find I
think a lot of this hippie stuff comes off
[SPEAKER_09]: is as disingenuous right hey and check
this out in wired they actually posted
[SPEAKER_09]: that Tesla gave away all of his patents
right yeah they posted that in wired yeah
[SPEAKER_09]: if you Google it Tesla just gave away all
its patents away to its competitors using
[SPEAKER_09]: the term a LL it happens and the guy's
still worth what three four bill Wow I
[SPEAKER_09]: don't think it hurt him yet but then again
there's bands like the Grateful Dead and
[SPEAKER_09]: fish that gave away their music that at
the time they were doing it the mechanism
[SPEAKER_09]: for profit only existed in keeping it and
selling it back to the fans they shattered
[SPEAKER_09]: through that and created something that a
lot of us would argue is better yeah well
[SPEAKER_03]: they be I mean listen bands make their
money bands bands don't make money through
[SPEAKER_03]: selling records bands make money by
joining touring no but record labels used
[SPEAKER_03]: to make money so I know they did but the
bands didn't themselves I mean you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cut an album and talked to record
companies and I know a little bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: how it works and it's like where if you're
an artist dealing with the record
[SPEAKER_03]: companies is not a you don't make any
money you make money on your touring you
[SPEAKER_03]: make money on on your merchandise and
rights and whatever but you might you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you might be lucky if you get 50 60 70
cents for a compact disc so well I think
[SPEAKER_08]: they could also shut down a lot of videos
on YouTube you know there's videos just
[SPEAKER_08]: about of every band other than Prince who
had his police go through there and
[SPEAKER_08]: completely take off all Prince content
from YouTube but the argument is that the
[SPEAKER_08]: people who post those YouTube videos a lot
of them are pirated are not the owners of
[SPEAKER_08]: that copyrighted music information but the
people who have the copyright aren't
[SPEAKER_08]: rushing to take that stuff down because it
provides publicity for them and also
[SPEAKER_08]: ultimately gains in value so it's like you
let a strain out or variety out and it
[SPEAKER_08]: wins a cannabis cup and everyone likes it
and all the growers want it and you just
[SPEAKER_08]: decide hey we're just gonna kind of like
let this go that can be a much more
[SPEAKER_08]: powerful business model in cannabis kind
of like in the same way you know don't you
[SPEAKER_03]: think yeah I mean there's lots of ways to
protect IP I mean since the Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_03]: secret Coca-Cola has never registered the
Coca-Cola secret you know go to the patent
[SPEAKER_03]: office again you don't teach you don't
teach your competitors how to do it and
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that cannabis is regulated and
it's so tightly controlled at least in
[SPEAKER_03]: these regulated systems that are
developing in Germany Australia and Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: and other countries that are doing federal
legalization you're not walking out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: facility with a plant okay you're just not
gonna do it you're not gonna be able to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it and if you're a big company you're also
not gonna label it from the production
[SPEAKER_03]: room you're not gonna call it this is my
CD CBG dominant you know type whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: type 2 terpenaline plant you're not gonna
label the plant it's gonna be X 7 4 9 6 3
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 6 and and the people that are doing the
production they're only gonna know that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is that tag and they're never gonna
know what it is in the output so because
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't matter to them they're just
making a product they're just a worker in
[SPEAKER_03]: a production line so there's lots of ways
that you can protect these things you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need to go out Pat stuff you can
develop unique things and profit from them
[SPEAKER_03]: without doing that and that's the choice
that every individual business is gonna
[SPEAKER_11]: make on their own yep well said Chimera
well said controversial topic awesome
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate yeah yeah it really is I like
it it's it's you know what I like having
[SPEAKER_09]: conversations that people are
uncomfortable to have that in this day and
[SPEAKER_09]: age and it conversations that trigger
things that try to shut the conversation
[SPEAKER_09]: down to me means there's value in that
conversation and it's one we should be
[SPEAKER_03]: having yeah and you know what you guys
have been very respectful in the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: that conversation is played out today I
mean I've seen this conversation unfold
[SPEAKER_03]: online and the immediate thing is those
assholes they're doing this and that and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're Monsanto I mean the article the
title of the article is Monsanto it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsanto these are like all time
researchers but that's the ultimate
[SPEAKER_09]: trigger word if you want to shut someone
down and you want people not to look too
[SPEAKER_09]: deep and you just want to shut it right
down then then Monsanto is your they're
[SPEAKER_03]: your guys just right so what's the agenda
of the person that started the article
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the agenda of the author right I
mean it's like we can start questioning
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody's agenda yeah 100% and and
that's the thing it goes back to that that
[SPEAKER_11]: whole reality that the things that we
don't understand we often viscerally will
[SPEAKER_11]: reject or you know take offensively you
know and it's so much more complicated
[SPEAKER_11]: complex of a topic you know and and I
think a lot of people in the same
[SPEAKER_11]: positions would would you know absolutely
go that direction of you know going to
[SPEAKER_11]: file in the actual property around the pad
you know around their work but yeah I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know it's just it's an interesting
thing because you know my you know I mean
[SPEAKER_11]: if they're smart enough to have done that
and already locked up all the type 2
[SPEAKER_11]: non-miracene strains you know it's like
where so it's like is there anybody else
[SPEAKER_11]: that is going to go figure out like the
pentols before them or or all the other
[SPEAKER_11]: super unique pathways before them well
think of this Alex think of it this way
[SPEAKER_09]: imagine they lock up all this stuff and
stuff that people didn't even know existed
[SPEAKER_09]: but now they do they're late to the game
and now they're looking for things that
[SPEAKER_09]: are specifically not those things that go
up they're gonna unveil things that are
[SPEAKER_09]: even further and deeper down the rabbit
hole no that's awesome that's and that
[SPEAKER_11]: that's actually the perfect answer I think
you know because you know when it all
[SPEAKER_11]: comes down to it doesn't fucking matter
you know philosophically ethically
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever as long as it's there and
available at some point even if it's being
[SPEAKER_11]: licensed you know then then it's still
still the still move I mean it's still
[SPEAKER_11]: it's still progressing the whole agenda of
the plant yeah I always have faith in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis listen it's like the bubble bags
I mean the bubble bag you know they came
[SPEAKER_03]: out and now you pay a licensing fee to the
guy who had the patent on it right yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that's what's gonna happen I mean
I don't think these guys are it's it's I
[SPEAKER_03]: think there's actually laws around you
can't patent stuff and then withhold
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing right yeah so you have to you
have to license it to people yeah exactly
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's fine like I I fought it for the
longest time and the more I looked at it
[SPEAKER_09]: the more I realized as I followed the
history back that it was like listen this
[SPEAKER_09]: was like the for 100% sure the bags
themselves were developed based on this
[SPEAKER_09]: machine that Reinhardt had patented
regardless of any other part of the story
[SPEAKER_09]: the bags that I made my bags from were
created based on Reinhardt's machine
[SPEAKER_09]: literally staring at his machine watching
it work can't really get around that to me
[SPEAKER_09]: that is the birth of the bags were the
Reinhardt's ice-cold extractor machine and
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to have paid the royalties out
from the beginning I didn't just start in
[SPEAKER_09]: like 2013 I paid from 1999 from the day
the company was created all the way till
[SPEAKER_09]: you know the future next hundred years
plus dude that's fascinating you've
[SPEAKER_11]: actually been through the whole reality
dude I went through a seven-year court
[SPEAKER_09]: case with Reinhardt though now we're like
now we're like partnered up on some
[SPEAKER_09]: projects and I've paid him his money for
the patent and I try to tell other people
[SPEAKER_09]: that are you know selling bags and just
like look you know you might want to look
[SPEAKER_09]: into this it's not worth the litigation
and it's the guy's super Lee not greedy
[SPEAKER_09]: but he'll hit you hard if you if you try
to fuck with him for a decade won't his
[SPEAKER_09]: patent be over in a couple of years he's
got an end to his patent in 2018 but if
[SPEAKER_09]: you look into patents there's all sorts of
different ways to extend them yeah brave
[SPEAKER_09]: new world they never really end if they
don't want them to and how much yeah and
[SPEAKER_11]: patents are only as good as their ability
to be enforced and but you know that's the
[SPEAKER_11]: thing people are pretty getting pretty
sophisticated with that whole side of
[SPEAKER_03]: litigation shit too and what people are
used to a world where you pay a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks to get ten seeds and then you do
what you want with it the rest of your
[SPEAKER_09]: life yeah wild west dude cannabis industry
for the longest time is like the wild wild
[SPEAKER_09]: west where people just do whatever they
want however they want and now the legal
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanism says well actually there's a
whole bunch of things you have to change
[SPEAKER_09]: if you want to play in the legal mechanism
that only fit in your prohibition based
[SPEAKER_09]: model you're gonna have to leave a lot of
this stuff behind like these are the
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanisms of business that are available
they're all different tools yeah well
[SPEAKER_03]: let's tonight can I interject there too
and extend it to say it's not even the
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanism of business it's like guys we
got to stop spraying Michael butanil on
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants you got to stop fucking
spraying bifentazate and forbid 4f and
[SPEAKER_03]: avid it's like it's these are also things
that we have to leave leave behind it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not okay to assume and say this is
how I've gotten by for the last 50 years
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not willing to change because you know
what we have to accept the new paradigm we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to in order to be taken seriously and
treat our clients with respect we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: adapt we have to everybody needs to raise
their game like every day and and treat
[SPEAKER_11]: the plant with the utmost respect and
integrity because otherwise it'll shake
[SPEAKER_03]: your ass off yep and the market will too I
mean look what happened with these
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that have been spanked in Canada
for having dude the Michael beaten all
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is destroying some folks I mean to
me I mean organogram I mean that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand killer it was an absolute brand
killer you know wasn't there a huge public
[SPEAKER_03]: removal of the CEO and everything oh yeah
it wasn't pretty it wasn't pretty but it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't the CEO's fault you know that they
actually they were a little bit of victim
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves and you know they're negligent
because they didn't monitor it but they
[SPEAKER_03]: hired a production company to come in and
run their grow oh wow I mean that's the
[SPEAKER_11]: reality though it's a really difficult
thing to grow cannabis especially in like
[SPEAKER_11]: abundance and on the huge scale you know
if you don't have incredible knowledge
[SPEAKER_11]: doing IPM and organic you know prevention
stuff you know and protocol I think it's
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna weed most people out on their own by
based off their like chasing of fool's
[SPEAKER_11]: goals you know to like rap too quick yeah
and it's the same thing with the mites
[SPEAKER_03]: that happens in the black market and
you're seeing this and you guys have
[SPEAKER_03]: published these great graphs that I use on
Twitter that show you know the level of
[SPEAKER_03]: contamination but this is what happens is
people they see a pest like week two and
[SPEAKER_03]: they spray and it ends up in the flowers
and it's it's too much of an investment
[SPEAKER_03]: for that person to lose they've got their
future wrapped up in their $40,000 or
[SPEAKER_03]: $80,000 it's coming down out of the crop
even if it's $5,000 you know people are
[SPEAKER_09]: they're so counting on that money to get
by they've already spent it dude or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe listen it's not always it's not
always Ferrari sometimes it's rent you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I mean or food right it was like this
to these people this is sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_03]: $25,000 glass pieces yeah but sometimes
it's like the ability to eat right or the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to pay your rent or your mortgage
right so there's a heavily heavy incentive
[SPEAKER_03]: to to protect with your investment and and
that's why we need regulation right it's
[SPEAKER_03]: because as we've seen just leaving it to
the market letting people do what they
[SPEAKER_03]: want and expecting that they're gonna act
responsibly has been shown that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work right we need regulation we need to
have a set of rules that everybody has to
[SPEAKER_03]: play by if you want to participate in the
market there it is you know I know people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like hearing that but it's the truth
it's like it's not okay it's not okay to
[SPEAKER_03]: put on Michael butanil weed or avid weed
or by fantasy weed or you know whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: fluoramide weed on the market it's not
okay well that's just one of the trippiest
[SPEAKER_11]: parts kind of you know it's a because a
lot of you know because back then before
[SPEAKER_11]: we opened up SC labs I worked at you know
big hydro store kind of chain in Santa
[SPEAKER_11]: Cruz and and yeah I mean you see you
really you know there's a divide you see
[SPEAKER_11]: really well-intentioned people that are so
of this plant and like this do no harm and
[SPEAKER_11]: would never even imagine spraying one of
those things you know but then there's
[SPEAKER_11]: other people that you know are
well-intentioned and they're trying to do
[SPEAKER_11]: good but but yeah man this is a this is a
cash crop and you know crop loss you know
[SPEAKER_11]: even the smallest amounts so huge to
people that are living grow to grow dude
[SPEAKER_11]: don't have their farm plan down you know
even further the people that just don't
[SPEAKER_11]: give a fuck because they're trying to make
as much money as they can you know and so
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I think that that's significant
spectrum of the type of person that's
[SPEAKER_03]: working with this plan it's gonna if you
go if you go into a hydra store pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much anywhere in Canada not all of them
but almost all of them and you ask for
[SPEAKER_03]: Nova under the counter they'll sell it to
you no tax cash sale no receipt you know
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's they're not allowed to do that
it's like it's against the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide regulations for them to sell it
to anybody that's not you know that's not
[SPEAKER_11]: a train most hydro stores do and are and
have it historically in the past also been
[SPEAKER_11]: the biggest slangers of like PGRs you know
and and it's because a significant demand
[SPEAKER_11]: for those exists and if you don't have
them so go to the neighboring hydro store
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah they're there beholden to their
customer listen any industry where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: beholden to the customer you know like
even even doctors written prescriptions
[SPEAKER_03]: for opioids or whatever you know the
doctor in the states at least it's not as
[SPEAKER_03]: bad and can't in other countries where
it's not a privatized healthcare system
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's one thing I definitely noticed in
the states is that the doctor is beholden
[SPEAKER_03]: to the client and the customer is the
patient in that case he is the one that's
[SPEAKER_03]: paying the bill if you go in and you ask
for Zoloft or t3s or even Oxycontin yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll give it to you right because
they're beholden to you it's like they
[SPEAKER_03]: want there you're their clients they're
making money off you you're pairing their
[SPEAKER_03]: rent you're paying they're they're putting
the bread on their table that's a
[SPEAKER_09]: significant flaw in the ability for
nervous about how many dispensaries we
[SPEAKER_09]: have that aren't forced to test you know
if they're not forced to test will they
[SPEAKER_09]: test or will a lot of that product get
sold to people that are you know patients
[SPEAKER_03]: man I'd listen I yeah about this on
Twitter all the time but like I'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: be I'd love to be on side of the Canadian
dispensaries and I unfortunately can't
[SPEAKER_03]: because most of them refuse to test roast
most of them refuse to demand testing from
[SPEAKER_03]: their MA our growers and it's bullshit
because I've seen cities like I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: you know how California's done it I've
seen how Berkeley California has done it I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean they have a dispensary market where
it's it's member patient cultivators it's
[SPEAKER_03]: all home growers right it's like the same
type of people that are supplying the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries in Canada but they demand
they require that you test the medicine to
[SPEAKER_03]: show that it's clean before it ends up on
the shelves and and it can be done and
[SPEAKER_03]: those people can produce and and patients
can make money they can be part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry but creating a situation and
calling it a dispensary where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing untested medicine on the market I
just I'm sorry I can't get behind it I
[SPEAKER_03]: would never buy dispensary weed in Canada
I wouldn't do it right well you know
[SPEAKER_11]: there's also this really huge kind of
thing happening in California right now I
[SPEAKER_11]: mean it's turned into like one of the
biggest like social media like troll wars
[SPEAKER_11]: that I've ever seen take place and you
know basically there was this you know I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know if you any of you are familiar
with but there's this in California
[SPEAKER_11]: there's this proposition called prop 65
and prop 65 makes you basically have to
[SPEAKER_11]: label and put up signs that say you know
this product is known in the state of
[SPEAKER_11]: California to cause cancer and birth
defects and blah blah blah and and and so
[SPEAKER_11]: what you have are these like ambulance
chasing lawyers that will basically go and
[SPEAKER_11]: document like repeated kind of violations
of not having signs in certain retail
[SPEAKER_11]: spaces you know to say that type of prop
65 claim and and so you know in a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: industries the prop 65 thing is really
it's a really kind of lame kind of lawyer
[SPEAKER_11]: chasing kind of like litigation scam kind
of thing but but what they what what just
[SPEAKER_11]: happened is they they they just on the
California Attorney General website you
[SPEAKER_11]: know they just published like 650 lawsuits
like for prop 65 to a lot of the biggest
[SPEAKER_11]: fucking brands and companies throughout
California because there are all these
[SPEAKER_11]: samples I guess that were independently
just pulled off shelves and then tested
[SPEAKER_11]: and then have found to have pesticides in
them and then they basically use the
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticides as a way to do this prop 65
litigation claim in cannabis in cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: and and so so yeah so it's it's crazy so
you know there's these these spreadsheets
[SPEAKER_11]: basically that have like a most in all of
the biggest like you know cartridge
[SPEAKER_11]: companies and stuff in California and and
they're you know they just all end on a
[SPEAKER_11]: spreadsheet and have like what pesticides
they all failed for and so so you know you
[SPEAKER_11]: basically people are like just reposting
it reposting reposting an Instagram when
[SPEAKER_11]: when they have thousands or hundreds of
thousands of followers and and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: just creating these huge kind of wars
where these trolls are basically then
[SPEAKER_11]: going and doing like these mass attacks on
these different brand pages you know of
[SPEAKER_11]: all these people saying you're poisoning
patients poison patients and then you know
[SPEAKER_11]: in return you know all these different
companies are you know posting all these
[SPEAKER_11]: these clean lab results trying to be like
we test clean we test clean you know and
[SPEAKER_11]: so and it's funny because you know most
people that you know clean you know
[SPEAKER_11]: probably have more failing tests than they
have clean tests you know but there's
[SPEAKER_11]: there's not this you know that's one of
the the holes in the the way testing
[SPEAKER_11]: currently exists you know because whenever
and when that's listening that wing isn't
[SPEAKER_11]: 100% being done by like a state certified
sampling agent or you know somebody of non
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of bias potential you know then you
know you could test anything and then
[SPEAKER_11]: anything and posted and you know there's
no kind of necessarily integrity I guess
[SPEAKER_11]: based in you know the full testing you
know scheme you know but but that's what
[SPEAKER_11]: it's gonna be you know kind of you know I
definitely believe you know believe is
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna be fixed with kind of the the
regulation in California coming up because
[SPEAKER_11]: that that's similar way oriented is they
you know they require you know the lab or
[SPEAKER_11]: a state certified sampling lab that just
does that on its own to kind of then you
[SPEAKER_11]: know basically do the statistically about
sampling of the batches and then you know
[SPEAKER_11]: tamper-proof sealing of the packaging and
then you know lab results are then or a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot you know send samples are going to the
lab you know if you're a chain of custody
[SPEAKER_11]: process both law results ultimately go
through the quality system to be
[SPEAKER_11]: ultimately release and then on the release
you know the with the clean like bill of
[SPEAKER_11]: health or whatever I guess the certificate
of analysis of clean herb then it can go
[SPEAKER_11]: into the regulated markets to be sold yeah
and that's you know that's one thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: California's done really well Canada has
kind of tried to do this and you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: record batch numbers and you have to
archive batch samples even so that if
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a future issue that the regulator
can come in and access your your archive
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially and pull it the corresponding
sample the Canadian failure though is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've allowed companies to do
first-party lab testing as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: third-party lab testing for huge and
that's a mistake so there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: companies like Aurora for example that
still choose to do third-party lab testing
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know they have an in-house
research lab yeah but the information that
[SPEAKER_03]: ends up on their package is done by a
third-party tested lab and I know I I
[SPEAKER_03]: advise all my clients to third-party for
your test results because it takes that
[SPEAKER_02]: impression out that you could be missing
results right educational services through
[SPEAKER_02]: the Gladius Network it's one of the first
things we teach families is if there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: company that won't provide third-party
testing or won't share their test results
[SPEAKER_02]: then you just don't use them bingo bingo I
you know because clean testing is
[SPEAKER_02]: something to be proud of so yeah they're
either doing it or they have some
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge yeah if you have play as you're
showing them because it's great you know
[SPEAKER_03]: well that listen there's a little bit of a
financial thing at play too I mean in
[SPEAKER_03]: California there's so many testing labs
that the prices come down and it's quite
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive in Canada there's not that
level of access and there's actually extra
[SPEAKER_03]: tests that are required like heavy metals
that are actually much more expensive to
[SPEAKER_11]: perform than just but not a thousand
motherfucking dollars dude there's like
[SPEAKER_03]: coaching happening up there dude no well
for a full battery of testing like a full
[SPEAKER_03]: full battery of tests including aflatoxins
and you know cannabinoids terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: aflatoxins microbial heavy metals yeah it
cost a thousand bucks that's still tax
[SPEAKER_11]: though that's almost like yeah that's
that's really I mean you know that that
[SPEAKER_09]: full thing kind of you know should you
mind our thousand boxes like 700 of yours
[SPEAKER_11]: ah oh yeah no that that helps because I
was gonna say like four to five hundred
[SPEAKER_11]: you know I think is kind of around where
that would be that's where it's kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: evening out in Oregon 50% more expensive
up here but we have everything is 30% more
[SPEAKER_11]: expensive because of the exchange and
alcohol is like doubly expensive yeah even
[SPEAKER_09]: more than doubly no I'm with John Mayer
alcohol is a con yeah he's gone that's
[SPEAKER_09]: awesome use for it in my life awesome
that's a great answer there's no spiritual
[SPEAKER_03]: significance down yeah well that's also
why it's twice the price it's all tax
[SPEAKER_03]: right this is it's the government trying
to like convince you not to do it and if
[SPEAKER_03]: you are gonna do it they're gonna tax you
on it now so that when you end up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: health care system later on you've already
paid into it oh that's hilarious it's true
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the reality though I mean that's the
way it works we want those people drinking
[SPEAKER_03]: booze to pay for our health care well they
pay for their health care is what they do
[SPEAKER_09]: right well but they pay for ours too
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway I think that was a solid four hours
and seven minutes great conversation guys
[SPEAKER_09]: wonderful past church today it was we're
two away from three year anniversary so
[SPEAKER_09]: hopefully in the next week or so I'll have
a plan set up hopefully with Natasha
[SPEAKER_09]: because she's much better at plans than I
am plus she's like really good don't make
[SPEAKER_09]: Natasha your secretary she's a doctor oh
gosh no she's not my secretary but she is
[SPEAKER_09]: an amazing facilitator of hash church I
think of her more as like a producer she's
[SPEAKER_09]: really helpful she gets great new people
on there she's actually today she was
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna get the guy who had his bong taken
away in Ontario and then was like he was
[SPEAKER_09]: standing out in front of the police
station in his underwear puff and bong
[SPEAKER_09]: rips and I was kind of like maybe you
should interview him before we just let
[SPEAKER_09]: him come on but you know I listened to a
couple of interviews with him and the guy
[SPEAKER_09]: knows the rules to the ACM PR and he's
he's well-spoken and we'll probably end up
[SPEAKER_09]: having him on next week at least for a
little while to tell us his insane it's
