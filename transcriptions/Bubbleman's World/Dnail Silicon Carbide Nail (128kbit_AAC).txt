[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
and today we are doing a little review
[SPEAKER_00]: from one of my favorite companies,
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the shirt, boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little show off there on the
logo on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just received this from my good friends,
Brian Stevie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over at D-Nail, and I've been working with
D-Nail for maybe the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: since you guys have seen me whipping
around the world with these different
[SPEAKER_00]: units and different nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen me with titanium nails,
you've seen me with quartz nails,
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic inserts, sapphire inserts,
and today something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have a silicon carbide that
they've been working on for the last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor testing and terpene testing,
thermal dynamics, really putting more in
[SPEAKER_00]: than the average bear into the focus on
how these things work and how the nail
[SPEAKER_00]: should be heated and the distribution of
heat and how when it's applied a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: way, you preserve more particular
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they change changes something
with the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit is, I'm not sure if it's even
available, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an experimental unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they've released it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have it in a drop-down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My drop-down is not ready yet,
so I'm waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my straight fab that I traveled with
quite a bit, and once my quartz bowl got
[SPEAKER_00]: broken, I got pretty comfortable putting
the titanium nail into it, and it fit
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This nail, I like the way it fits a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes in loose, and it's not until it
drops that quarter inch to half inch into
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint that it actually kind of gets
snug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too worried about the metal on the
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people that irks them,
and I wish I had the drop-down for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have this down quite a bit
more, but for the sake of doing the review
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting it done, because life moves
fast and many more things will show up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a D420K yesterday and today,
and he brought me a really nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: gift of some OG Kush Dry Sift that is
right here, and he also brought me some
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, is that the old school New York City
Diesel that I remember that just pungently
[SPEAKER_00]: orange citrus winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun, and that's what we're going to
be testing today, the OG Kush and the New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One has the flavor of orange citrus,
that d-limonene, that valencine,
[SPEAKER_00]: mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's probably half a dozen or
more that taste and smell like different
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus lemons, limes, and what not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the OG Kush, which this
particular one is very earthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: very earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Dee was saying, it's like
putting a teaspoon of dirt in your mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: when you take a rip of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really pretty much that earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just to mention a few things,
with the silicon carbide, we don't use a
[SPEAKER_00]: metal tool and scrape around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying not really a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent me this lovely little
D-Nail wipe that I guess when it cools
[SPEAKER_00]: down, just with water and with this,
much the same way you would use on a
[SPEAKER_00]: camera lens, it comes off real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've only taken a few hits so far,
so it's relatively clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to clean it with a little bit of
cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some macro video of that in slow
motion so you can see the Dry Sift falling
[SPEAKER_00]: off the dabber and dumping into this dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you one thing about this dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like Chicago deep dish pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to any other nail that I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you guys can see the size of
that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a nice size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, especially for these guys out
there that love taking the monster dabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be quite pleased with the
size of this dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to be doing reasonable
sized dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in the movies that I made
with the iPhone, the 240 frames per second
[SPEAKER_00]: when you see the melting and the bubbling,
there is a lot of smoke coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up, they did give me a really nice
carb cap with this nail, which I will show
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, which is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, funky little Devo style carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it just fits right on there
quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then has a little hole right on top
there, so quite a lovely little look to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not huge on the metal myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do appreciate the titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a situation when I'm traveling,
I've had the cords break on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cords breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no more cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: The titanium is an exceptional alternative
for traveling, especially because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: travel and not really worry about it
breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, without further ado, I think we're
going to have a little hit of the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two rips I took through this
thing was beautiful and tasty,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do feel that I lost a little bit
because I was unable to carve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the idea of carving it for a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess I am going to use the
titanium carb and not the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot that they sent me one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's use the one they sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy gets hot fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not want to leave this carb on
here for more than 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits exceptional though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a tiny little lip on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys can see that
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that tiny little lip just fits in
real, real nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exceptional flavor to taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: To taste test any kind of nail,
whether it was a quartz or a sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain, I can't say enough about how
strong the taste is, and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to D420K talk about this in our
own FaceTime conversations and in Google
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus and HashChurch where each time he
takes a hit, he sits there and he would go
[SPEAKER_00]: on about, oh my god, I wish you guys could
taste this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always like, wow, come on,
we've tasted great, great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, as I sit here and I taste it,
I got to admit, D, you were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exceptional resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Christ, does it taste good on the
lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in an orange grove and hitting it off
the new silicon carbide nail head with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership fab egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a really nice combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trio, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're gonna get another one
ready soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would love to know is what can
I wipe it with right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I kind of just give it a quick
little wipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a little paper towel that I dipped
in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's what he said in the
letter to use this little D nail cloth
[SPEAKER_00]: that he sent me dipped in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty confident that there's 80% of
this dish left, so why don't we hit the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: code?
[SPEAKER_00]: Push in a nice fresh section.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go double up on the, we'll see what
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I hit these earlier in the courts and
I have to say, so far, the New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel tasted the best off the silicon
carbide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to learn and talk to the guys
and figure out what are the thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics behind heating up the nail in
this particular way and having it designed
[SPEAKER_00]: this way with this size of a dish and what
exactly is silicon carbide to offer that
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz or sapphire or ceramic or titanium
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: These things interest me and of course I'd
love to bring that information to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more than just a simple
review, but going into something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit deeper and letting them know why is
this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have another rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste on the NYCD was much,
it was increased from the intensity that I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt off of the quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a more intense citrus taste,
but the OG, the OG was this earthy taste
[SPEAKER_00]: and that taste almost brought it,
almost cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost cleaned up the earthy taste and
it's still got an earthy taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's of a cleaner earth if that makes
any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, I wish I would have had a couple
other people's opinions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that would have been a cooler
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do a little video the next time
I get together with Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a real connoisseur in that sense and
we can do a little taste testing because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, there's something to be
said for this nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste on it is so good that I consider
using it even though it's got the titanium
[SPEAKER_00]: body and I love the idea anytime I can
getting away from metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, I just like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quartz makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metal look on this, my mind I can feel
is judging it, yet over on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the honest opinion that wow,
does that have an incredible flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I feel that it's a little
bit missing out on in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a tool that I can scrape
around on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told it's not the best idea to
scrape the surface with a hard tool like
[SPEAKER_00]: titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe over time you scratch and it
releases dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to find out those things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a real simple review for
today and I'll come back with a more
[SPEAKER_00]: intense backup once I've talked to Brian
and Stevie and figured out exactly a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more information for you guys
on this nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the bubble man's perspective,
the taste was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not stoked on the idea of metal in the
pipe, but a simple drop down alleviates
[SPEAKER_00]: such a worry as long as the weight,
which isn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too, too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't put it on a drop down that went
out too far just in case, but I think on a
[SPEAKER_00]: drop down that goes substantially down and
up, it'll sit right here nicely and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to thank both Brian and
Stevie and all the people at Dnail for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great work that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting me guys and allowing
me to help you guys out with doing cool
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this and little reviews and
giving my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never asked me in any way,
shape or form to sway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never asked me to say my opinion is
one thing or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just really want my honest opinion
and that's how I know that they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the good work and they're looking to
better the product constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the silicon carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it a shot for the next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to go back and forth
with this and the quartz and do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: taste testing and see what we can find in
the differences of low temp dabs versus
[SPEAKER_00]: high temp dabs with this particular unit
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can check these products out on
Dnail and I believe I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a discount code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to contact me,
at bubble man at bubble bag dot com or
[SPEAKER_00]: check the comments section of this video
and I'll put in my code that you can write
[SPEAKER_00]: Dnail with or get in touch with Dnail,
email them whatever and that should get
[SPEAKER_00]: you a discount off on some products that
you want to buy from those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be another great great way
to help support these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've puffed a couple of bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling very iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe we'll leave you with one more
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say goodbye with one more bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go back for that unbelievably tasty
New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally brought me back to somas like
2003, 2000, maybe even 2003, 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taste on that is so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what made Tangy popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what made Jilly Bean popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what made Calio popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what made New York City Diesel
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That orange citrus flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World,
guys.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
