[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're here with Tony Verzura
from YouCan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here with Richie Spice, the General.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm here from Kingston, Jamaica,
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Irish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the herb we call vibration,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, right now, you see,
there's a thing going on here in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: called Chikangoni, where in which,
you know, they say it was, they catch it
[SPEAKER_01]: by a mosquito bite, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and when you catch that,
it's like, when you get over the symptom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it leave you with, like,
you know, like seven years or two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on your age, you know,
what I found, pains, aches and pains,
[SPEAKER_01]: muscle pain, giant pains, and such other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we went to doctor,
there's no cure, you know, they only can
[SPEAKER_01]: give you something like painkiller for
these giant pains and such other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've got some tablet the
other day, you know, from a good friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine, made of herbs, you know,
we're in which mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the prescription tablet for two
days and said I'll give it a try,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've taken it and, you know,
I don't say I've get over it fully yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that, you know, I've been over
it fully as yet, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling better, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the herbs again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from the herbs, so, you know,
I think I'll continue to try it and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what result it brings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so what Richie's talking about is,
and it sounded really at first strange,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I kept asking it, because it
wasn't just one person that had it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you were saying 70% of the actual
island is actually affected by this
[SPEAKER_02]: strange, strange type of phenomenon of
something that's either airborne,
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow just plumed or evolved on the
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all of a sudden 70% of everyone
has this chick V and it sounds almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: a carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a degeneration of the central nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It explains that the hands start to curl
in, almost like paralysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a degenerative paralysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually, today when we were going
over everything with our booth,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had a bunch of different handouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been here for three or four days
with a bunch of different handouts about
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system, the keys and
locks of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of explained how that
endocannabinoid system works with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pronobionutrient conditionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you out there haven't seen this
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't had the time to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This breaks down the P1 through P4
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually see that we've
eliminated active THC out of the program,
[SPEAKER_02]: but still utilize THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So P1s are THCA, P2s are your CBDA,
daytime formula, and then P3s are more of
[SPEAKER_02]: a one-to-one, and the P4s are CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that allows me to do now with the
Act Now program is to look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: different ailments and be able to target
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that the sublingual will help
with the central nervous system,
[SPEAKER_02]: and capsules will actually help with the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to bring some plant fat and
some actual isolated terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of people ask me why I have the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the plant fat and the terpenes
that I bring with me, we can literally
[SPEAKER_02]: extract resin wherever we go using bubble
man's extraction, or Emotex, or
[SPEAKER_02]: subcritical CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we get to the resin,
we can actually start to create these
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really the mission of United
Cannabis is partnering with different
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations like CRD, Weed MD,
and our newest venture with Lone Mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoo in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what people are asking,
what are we trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're trying to implement this
technology and this way of creating
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and allowing us to really dial in
sequence of sin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to make something like a P3
and a P4 for Richie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we actually tried that on about
four other people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody has the same results so far,
which I knew would be the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, oh my god, ganja could actually
help the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people here are now starting to
understand the significant value of what
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant just in a simple case and point
could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never say to anyone out there that
this is a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that can help manage a
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cures would be like if we could study
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also why I'm down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would like to see that the
medical ganja laws get changed and that
[SPEAKER_02]: universities allow us to do clinical
trials and try to figure out the
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing matched with the programs that
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this information people try
to ask me where I come from, where I come
[SPEAKER_02]: up with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's like, well, where'd you
come up with all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff is patient driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I have 100 autism patients and I see
that the P2 and the P5 and the P4 work
[SPEAKER_02]: with autism, then I document that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have softwares that document that
and they give us ratings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking for efficiency here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for 85 plus percentile
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it helps me to know those
and have these different patients database
[SPEAKER_02]: so that way when you say, hey,
I have some kind of paralysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know right away it's gonna be a P3 and a
P4 in the combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even the P1, which is the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you're getting the nerve
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a tool that not just the
hospitals and physicians and doctors in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica will appreciate, but I think a lot
of physicians across the country and
[SPEAKER_02]: people in Canada will eventually
understand what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And California also.
[SPEAKER_02]: California, yeah, you're seeing a lot in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to a majority of the shops where
I've seen a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that people don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes when you hear people ask
you about it, people don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical use of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just know like billophosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and burn a giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more to it than just burning a
giant, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's the biggest thing is
where everyone's trying to learn where
[SPEAKER_02]: health, medical, and responsible adult use
or recreational social use comes into
[SPEAKER_02]: play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what that comes to is that once
everyone understands that we have an
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system and there is a
locking key for a signaling system that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, whether they're smoke
ingested, rubbed on our skin, taken in
[SPEAKER_02]: sublingual capsule, once it gets into our
body, cannabinoids help balance our
[SPEAKER_02]: systems between our central nervous system
and our immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that is going to present a
efficiency rating of how that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So smoking a joint that's 50 milligrams,
once you hit it with 451 degrees,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're now keeping it a one dimensional or
two dimensional type of therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're smoking pure THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC has its benefits, but it also comes
with a psychoactive experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found that I took 50,
50 patients, 50% of the patients actually
[SPEAKER_02]: want to feel their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them enjoy that response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you study and look at safety
profiles of opiates and Tylenol and actual
[SPEAKER_02]: activated THC, opiates are one in 10,
Tylenol is one in 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: And THC active from a split is one in
40,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 100 times the recommended dose of
Tylenol, you risk a possibility of death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shows you how safe THC actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having an inactive program also with
the ability to activate that allows
[SPEAKER_02]: patients a true diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a cannabis user and you want to
feel that, maybe you don't want to smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's allowed this kind of building that
system into it along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it really covers a wide
spectrum and it's easy to look at because
[SPEAKER_02]: then it has a list of the categories and a
list of all the different ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to have another chart
that actually lists the combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens when you combine a P2 and a
P4 or a P3 and a P1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ultimately, that's our goal is to
educate the physicians and the doctors and
[SPEAKER_02]: the patients and the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: To understand that it can be used in a
very, very, very safe and effective way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not causing harm on society.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not causing side effects to human
beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use nutrients as our delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're using plant packs and
we're trying to deliver medicinal food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you talk about medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for me myself, I know that there's
a lot of substance in these same herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: here, Greenwich Mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably people never really go so deep
inside to look to see the uses of green
[SPEAKER_01]: which it has to really help the human
race.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I always say, I know that it's a
tree, Greenwich Mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the king of the forest because it's a
tree, Greenwich Mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenwich Mean is the only tree that they
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only tree, but this tree is a
male and a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenwich Mean is a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they use these trees, it can give you
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a time to relax and meditate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing that now and so many things going
on in the world, worldwide now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really have to look and say,
but there's something different to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I said before, we have a lot of
herbs in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can name them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, people are just discovering
them and finding different types of use
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use them up because even the same
chickpea, when it comes in, people turn to
[SPEAKER_01]: the herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a thing named aloe vera.
Neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Busy, busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soursop, Meringue.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinyard weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinyard weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just start turning back to the
herbs because when these things break out
[SPEAKER_01]: in Jamaica, there's nothing to cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people just think, so right now it's
only herbs alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't go back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really get back themselves to what
they were before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting that now,
and it's always been, herbs and using
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal herbs has been around for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's interesting now that
we're finally taking a look and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really what we're trying to do here is
convince people to take a look at cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: as a medicinal herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take cannabis into the medicinal
herb category with the other medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs, we don't even know the
relationships yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you talked about vibration,
the male and the female offers a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: type of vibration in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis has a certain type of
vibration just like other medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really look at the emotion and
polarity and all of these other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: components of what makes up a medicinal
herb, you find that there's a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They vibrate a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They intersect in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a deeper relationship to each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like cannabis is left off the
bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going for a gig and cannabis is
like the drum stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden you take off and you're
like, hey, wait a minute, where's my
[SPEAKER_02]: drummer at?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh yeah, he's not allowed on
the bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to find his own way to the gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, but he's the drummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He holds it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the king of the forest is being left
off the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give thanks to everything and give
thanks to know that people are really
[SPEAKER_01]: finding out how great this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing is that some
people were scared at first before we came
[SPEAKER_02]: here, what we were actually trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once the locals realized that we
actually had a plan on utilizing local
[SPEAKER_02]: agrarian farms and controlling the
centralized station, the nursery with
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders and genetics and cultivation and
supplying them with education and
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got different groups out here with
CRD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got partners that have been here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got another one on the board that's
doing administration and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we could do is start to raise that
minimum wage for people right now to
[SPEAKER_02]: $1.80.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could start raising that
minimum wage right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get training programs from
cultivation, from educational programs at
[SPEAKER_02]: the universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as job placement reform,
breaking down the plans, processing the
[SPEAKER_02]: plans, and creating those products with
Jamaican brands in Jamaica to then be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to export.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the community of Jamaica is a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think people missed the
first time we were here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they understand that they want to
unite all of the current farmers and give
[SPEAKER_02]: them the opportunity that we were given in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were able to come out of the
shadows and into a legitimate market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you know you're cultivating for
medicine, you want to be treated as a
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal doctor for a medicinal group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to tell you right now to be
frank with you, many people leave Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Musicians and a lot of people leave
Jamaica right now to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to work on the herb farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so many jobs there for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in rich need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Musically, you can't help them because the
music is not earning enough to support all
[SPEAKER_01]: those musicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in California right now,
many men working on the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the herb farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not picking, clipping, cutting,
packing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's a great manager and a
great look, as you said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really feel happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel great to know that Jamaica
started to realize what time it is right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in which means ancient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were saying it a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that right here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Touch, there was an artist named
Peter Touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been abused over the same
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to jail and for the buss-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Bob Marley, them speak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same speed, you know, burning spear.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those elders, you know,
and it come down to Iron Eye now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a younger generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we feel good in ourselves to
know that right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of what our elders, you know,
Asian people stand up for, coming out to
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and coming on board now and
legalizing and freeing up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our country, you know,
generation or future generation or younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, you know, can benefit,
you know, and, you know, our children can
[SPEAKER_01]: go to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can find lunch money to give
our kids to go to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can pay our bills, pay our light
bills or water rates, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and live a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think this is the first time since
it all started, where I've seen everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday during the speech, about
awareness and acceptance of this plan on
[SPEAKER_02]: these different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids that I spoke to from community
college, they were here asking a million
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw pastors testify.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw doctors testify.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw everyone in the community really
supporting this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now I think that what Peter Tosh,
Bob Marley and everyone else that's had to
[SPEAKER_02]: go through prohibition years, having to be
prosecuted, thrown in jail, harassed,
[SPEAKER_02]: crops stolen, even street deaths,
everything else that goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: To finally have recognition from the whole
community is why I'm using my driving
[SPEAKER_02]: force here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you still have resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have resistance in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been enough dues paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamaica needs to get into the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're doing it slowly,
but I think they're doing it the right
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking to say, open up
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to open up the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they're going to open up the
ganja industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like right now everybody is
talking about decriminalization and
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does Jamaica want to go all the way
with legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand the fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's still in the fear in the United
States, where three or four, five states
[SPEAKER_02]: are happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two more states in 2016 that have
come up with legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's in California for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's in Arizona for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start to see the, what's happening
is you'll see the progression in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to set up these tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to set up hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to set up medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once regulation, and once
society, and all of this stuff is really
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with it, then they release
that portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really they push for regulated
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they can tax it, just like
any government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, that is a must because,
you know, the government has to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, always.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make it be something where the small
man have something the same way where he
[SPEAKER_01]: can, you know, live his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, you know, we have that tax in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like 22% tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at cigarettes and you look
at alcohol, not that I would compare it to
[SPEAKER_02]: because I believe it's medicine first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the tax on it,
it's a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that kind of tells you they
actually do somewhat respected a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more in the fact that they did 40%
tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they put 22% tax on it, medical still
gets a tax of 7%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened in Colorado since the
legal one, we went legal, they actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: from licenses and different permits and
fees and stuff, they actually have to
[SPEAKER_02]: return 36 million in taxes to the people
of Colorado because the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: not even in its first year yet,
has already generated, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 million in schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And enough money to go back to the rest of
the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's already a, from a business
standpoint, for the rest of the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that think that it should just be
legalized or it's fine for medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't use it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just getting a check.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're participating in the movement
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's, I like that when I see,
you know, 50, 60% of the country are,
[SPEAKER_02]: how about the state who is the favorite
for full out legal cannabis and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, that were voting health,
they didn't use cannabis, but they still
[SPEAKER_02]: supported the freedom of the industry,
respected the movement, and now they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a check.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not so bad, you know,
on the legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, I think you can see
the positive influx here, especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: tourism, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm feeling so happy about this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just feel that a different
atmosphere, a different here, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like something will happen that is very
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they deserve, if they can get to
medical and they get through full out
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, I think Jamaica would be the
center point of tourism on the planet
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you don't have, now people don't have
to leave the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now musicians are here because more people
are coming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have cannabis and the herbs and
with the juices and everything else around
[SPEAKER_01]: the island and you have a new freedom
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we have the sun, beaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun, the beaches, the freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah man, bless the world, bless the
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is prophecy, positive and profitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my name is Rowan Brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an artist, yeah, prophecy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reggae artist, incorporating with CRD,
with the Science Research Council in
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization of marijuana, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: From a spiritual standpoint as an artist,
from a musical standpoint, from an
[SPEAKER_04]: economical standpoint, and from adding
different value and removing different
[SPEAKER_04]: stigmas that can't be over the years as
perception has taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely we come in here, we speak about
weed, it's the purpose of the people going
[SPEAKER_04]: and weed is not the trick of the mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to move away from that to like a
conference like this where we're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: use weed as something to gain a strong
economic benefit from and to really change
[SPEAKER_04]: the stigma of how people look at weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And better value for people in the sense
of health and our intake that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: really extract from the weed and really
help a society or a country to really make
[SPEAKER_04]: better health for all the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to say thumbs up to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: CRD, Kenanabites Research Development has
been a great influence on my life since I
[SPEAKER_04]: came up and give thanks to all of the
members and the participants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks to the Caribbean Research
Council, give thanks to the government,
[SPEAKER_04]: give thanks to the lawyers and the others
together to really create the legislation,
[SPEAKER_04]: to really create the outlook on how
economists can be valid from the
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks to the people who are there
pushing the government and getting them
[SPEAKER_04]: very assertive on the quick call,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And quick action to really do something as
it relates to Kennedy's views and
[SPEAKER_04]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_04]: The forum has been good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ministers come through, they talk,
the university teachers drink it down to
[SPEAKER_04]: the students, you know, throwing away
their awesome speech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks to Buggleman again,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself was the witch's spice and we all
enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking at the social components
of ganja, weed, we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal value of weed, we're looking at
property rights of weed, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: the farmers, we're looking at people who
have gotten the blunt over the years,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're looking at the musician who has been
great advocate for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking at diversity as in not
just weed, but in our herbs, which is why
[SPEAKER_04]: I say here in Kingston, Jamaica,
we have different kind of herbs,
[SPEAKER_04]: you understand me?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, herbs is traditionally known as
Jamaican herbs over the years that heal
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed is no separation from that,
but I think our main focus is to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what weed does and what we can
give.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to our economic life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our life as people, I do endorse it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the purpose of the weed keeps on
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed is not here to take a mile,
it is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the far I am blessed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, rally around this great cause
as I know that it can really do great
[SPEAKER_04]: things for an artist, for economy,
for people, for science, for research,
[SPEAKER_04]: for social components, for everyday or
everyday life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just embrace it, look to the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless us, we're here right now at the SRC
conference, which basically will bring
[SPEAKER_05]: Golgantra conference in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, I think it's a good start.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good start and it kind of show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would call it Mount Sinai.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when most over there and I look
and I say, oh, Joshua, what am I getting
[SPEAKER_05]: in the land cause I hear something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough for we who have fought mission will
not make it to the promised land,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I and I is Joshua.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this right here is Mount Sinai.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I see the future and I hope that
Jamaica can see the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a great, great
experience, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great avenue for my
culture, a great, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is an opportunity for all them people
who they already get beat up and pushed
[SPEAKER_05]: aside for starts, gets, this is new
escape.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no longer escape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let's get higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: Escape, poverty, wealth and health.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: A ounce of herb oil is more than a ounce
of gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know that Jamaica has green.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're gonna go green.
[SPEAKER_05]: And personally, it's not really for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a case where to each his own,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you come here for trying to get
gone rob and steal from the culture and
[SPEAKER_05]: rasta with herb, it's not gonna work
around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's the alienation, the big guys,
we still have to work with the rasta man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even so, the rasta man them who,
peace be on them now, go work with certain
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa still work with certain people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unity strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're gonna get rid of the confusion
and get rid of, let's do business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cause we all going green.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all look gold, and that's the gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke weed like my name is in the
definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, when I see high, I see it in high
definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my own dabs, I don't need no
permission.
[SPEAKER_05]: Head to the west, speak with the best,
at least a pound permission.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ask me why I smoke, I ask why not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the sky every day, I'm a pilot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That me, my home is the airport.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who got the rail rails,
gunk, not no scapegoat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who got something that is wrinkled on a
rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: You caught three, twelve, ha ha,
caught short.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but not the one that we bleeding,
we smoking, we dabbling, we tearing,
[SPEAKER_05]: we steaming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, no man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I use herbs, I use up for medication,
the herbs for the healing of the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dreaded one, a giddy headed person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use herbs, give them to man,
spiritually, physically, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I like this time, look for a green
vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ganja, cannabis, is one of the main
plans for such right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defend it, we paid our dues for it
through the years coming up as a young
[SPEAKER_00]: man, been beaten by police and other
sources, for this jail, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still today I continue to find no
heels with the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it decriminalized so that
youngsters don't have to be put in prison
[SPEAKER_00]: and brutalized and killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plans of Babylon system just for this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that at the same time the
spiritual context of ganja, which brings
[SPEAKER_00]: certain entities and spirits closer
aligned to the truth, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open for them, questioning the system as
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes dangerous and threatening to
the society that controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And makes the laws to make this plan
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that is criminality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in itself is criminality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system has criminalized so many
thousands and thousands of youths
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the period by a mis-concept of
control totally massacred the world so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they won't think freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal properties aside, the benefits
of health aside, but just the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this plan stimulate you spiritually
to make you more aware and in tune to
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstruction program, what is in,
what is wrong for the society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the system persecute so many ones
in a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say shame on you Babylon system and
corporations who management of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: has criminalized this plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you know turning around to one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying, what is gonna be done to the
people who have paid so much dues through
[SPEAKER_00]: the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to retribute in some ways or
another?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Faray, blessings to y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember green herbs, green for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, kiddos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
