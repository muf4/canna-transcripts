D420K for a little dry sifting madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to show you the whole trip
there, but I'll give you a little clip
[SPEAKER_05]: here and there, and we'll be in Prince
George real soon with D420K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, peace.

burn.

bedroom wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marathon smoking because we could.

no reason.

system.

central Calais.

animosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody run go call me name to the
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Them say them kia take the smoke like ya

[SPEAKER_00]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got scoops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Christ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dry sift my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright Darren just loaded up some,
well I just loaded up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren's driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to try some of his dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god I love dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah there's a little eagle right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi eagle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we got pinched George.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh there's the local jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren spent a couple years there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't be going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah hunk of boys doing their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few bros up there right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them a honk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always honk when I drive by the prison
for my buddies.
[SPEAKER_05]: A quick little shot of a suburban PG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright so Darren's going to show us a
little bit of what we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably make a little bit of bubble
but it's really going to be a dry sift
[SPEAKER_05]: trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's got his four screens here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice little pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll clean that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right down to the 70.
[SPEAKER_05]: The magic screen.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the remnants of the 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put that away for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go check out the shop area.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bigger screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glass and stuff there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright so we're going out to Darren's
maze here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Show you a little bit of the madness that
he's done for his dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah what's up Darren?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in to my spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah it's a man cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah he's got the wheels plugged in
back there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jars up on the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: The screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No trespassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some pre-sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess these are pre-sifted.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's already sifted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of little buds in there and
stuff like that but you know one of my one
[SPEAKER_02]: of my buddies really really enjoys making
his moonshine fucking stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You leave him some resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just give that to him and he has his
personal moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've already taken your head out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we go hit that D now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time for me ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about this more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well welcome to Bulbman's World here with
D420K and we're in his dry sift palace.
[SPEAKER_05]: My den.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the dry sift den.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to get the D nail going.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's never actually hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just now showing me his dry sift
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a tiny little bit on the way in but.
[SPEAKER_02]: This here is a little bit of the this just
raw clean not pressed just nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: powderized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful and nice and pure headies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really tell this is like a nice
purity to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sandy look to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't fluffy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have those little kind of you
know the capitate stalks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like little sticks in there
sometimes and it makes it fluffy like you
[SPEAKER_05]: say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fluffy and light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sandy and dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll definitely be showing you guys
pictures of this so while we're looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: it and talking about it we'll show you the
macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks absolutely stellar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for once I don't have to worry whether
it's been dried properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh it's it's cured right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been sitting in the fridge for
probably a good solid month at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I think while you're showing me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little bit of the pressed and
nubbed stuff that I melted and showed
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of on the net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh those are those pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are those pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh it's fucking amazing man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that one there was done at you
know the one we were talking about at
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was telling me to melt it at a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was melted at one eighty one
seventy seven degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melted in the baggie and stirred in the
cup like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stayed into a caramel state where
we can take that and still goo it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: it still stays like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that I did with like finger
pressed from the raw form like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns into like a finger rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't repress into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the knees were melted at a different
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: At a different temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hotter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks hotter yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You lost your color a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the caramel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on Tony for sharing that information
and chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony from Delta Labs or River Rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: River Rock Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: River Rock Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're doing great things right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really hope to be able to make it
down there one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool that Tony showed you that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also another temperature that he
that he was mentioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: One sixty degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the caramel again?
[SPEAKER_02]: The caramel was one was one eighty.
[SPEAKER_05]: One eighty.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would go light light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was two hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we should try lower for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could do we could do a bit
with this stuff into a one sixty degree
[SPEAKER_02]: and stir it up and we can see what results
are on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I'm stoked for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this D nail plugged in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man that is just so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is I put them in these slick containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how it looks like that on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The platinum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after it sat for a while and I ended
up ordering some of these things off the
[SPEAKER_02]: net because I like the big containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are they glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I took them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I kind of just took it and I dumped
it out and it stayed in the form like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can also take it down into that form
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like what I've done with this stuff
here is this is the easy stuff that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: just you know you just get a little bit of
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little bit of press.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought the dab the dab kit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got our coil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to make sure when you're putting
this on that this bend is on the bottom
[SPEAKER_05]: and not the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically when it's on the top it creates
a little more and when it's on the bottom
[SPEAKER_05]: it just it's more secure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will be light enough that we'll be
able to keep that right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's a simple one switch on the
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn it on to allow the power to go to the
whip and then we'll go down to a nice 750.
[SPEAKER_05]: Push that button a second time and the
denail should be up to temperature within
[SPEAKER_05]: the next couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point it's just a matter of us
figuring out what we want to hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I want to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit anything you want here brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited to have to to have made
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to tell you man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Share this with you and let you smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me looking at this put such a huge
smile on my face because it's it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: simple information and it's when we listen
and we hear it this is the result.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you know great job dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I knew it was a great job from the
phone from even your photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need to see it right in front of
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go for the big guy here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just all powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He hasn't done anything with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just been allowed to stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then put it in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look I'll do one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: John freaks when you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor John.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's running all his own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said maybe you can send me up a little
taste of your fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like yes I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can send me some of your dry
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said yes I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I'm definitely going to hit this this
one in honor of John.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wish you were here John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we at 600.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love watching this thing climb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It climbs fast man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably been a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard so much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watched you melt so many bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never tried the D now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude I feel like maybe you should be
hitting it before me.
[SPEAKER_05]: All your bubbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to taste that at it's best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the colors on all this too are just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you got a screen to go on there too?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm going to go right into
the quartz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drop right on quartz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm preferring it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find on the screen it's real slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eye closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so nice to enjoy quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: With purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that's the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: People think that bubble bags give you
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They give you purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: The purity will show you the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important that people
understand the difference between purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purity means how pure is the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it 80 percent gland heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it 90 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it 99.9 percent gland heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to get 95 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you get this real nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean this just melted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I painted it along the side of the quartz.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you want to scoop a scoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you the gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got enough scoopers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I didn't clean that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to give someone a nice fresh
clean dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also find with the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: With these smaller little metal ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quick before it heats it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the bigger thicker ones you have a
little bit more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you go here.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you dump it in the center there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going right into the bong and it's
going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to go kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like you almost have to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then kind of do that little thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll learn your stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're going to be well capable
of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we were talking
about before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the way the methods of growing your
trichromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichromes yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right your quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens in the grow room for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and that's where it starts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genetics and then variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can control the variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can basically be.
[SPEAKER_05]: For indoor it's like you're being God.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to control everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more you control.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more likely your resin will go right
to maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I think I've hit this mother
ship too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mother ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very happy to be in Prince George.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeling blessed.
[SPEAKER_05]: To have good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be able to come and you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We share knowledge with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that Darren's going to show me
tricks that he's learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very important for me to learn
these tricks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to listen to the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure I may have shown someone how to do
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean they're not going to
show me how to do something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I come on these trips I'm most
excited to.
[SPEAKER_05]: To learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And judging by the hash that you have
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got some things to teach.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice isn't it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like a sublimator hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Works good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think Darren and I are going to do
that about 20 25 more times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome to join us if you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah we got a couple of good days
planned don't we.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little trick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick the dabber in the center.
[SPEAKER_05]: The quartz hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cleans it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You peeled off a piece of that caramel
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till you taste that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a nice way to peel a piece of
hash off.
[SPEAKER_05]: The warm dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is literally caramel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holding it in my hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you love puffing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The minute you hold this in your hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you say in your mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want lots of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A never stopping supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things people are going to ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the information that Tony passed on to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: About sealing it up in plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying boiling it at different
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you let them know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we talked about it briefly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just run them through what you did
briefly.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the 200 and the 180.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to show one on the camera as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So talk about each one you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll photograph them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And inlay the photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to see it really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones with the circles here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff here was basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I put in the slit containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That took that form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just pressed them into little
balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was talking with Tony from
River Rock Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: During a chat one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was suggesting melting it at
certain degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I did was I melted it at certain
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: What ended up taking place is the waxes
and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boiled and burst.
[SPEAKER_02]: The TTC boils at 177 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what it did is it almost turned
it into a butter like substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't press it and stick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just crumbly like cured finger
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wouldn't press together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now then I took this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you just had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you were in your head saying I want
more of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I melted this at 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take you back one second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this one of these balls?
[SPEAKER_05]: From your slick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it one of your finger press?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it literally just powder?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You started with powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it into a Ziploc baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a sandwich baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it onto the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrapped it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tied it up so it was all in the corner of
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was sealed and it wasn't going to
float around the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I took a cup of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boiled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the thermometer in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it boiled I put it in the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it got to 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I melted the first baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got that first stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did you do that for?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did it until it melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short time for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took it and I put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: To solid up right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's the first batch that I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second batch I used the powder as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight from the powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I melted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started at 180.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cooled down to 177, 176.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stirred the cup with the same method
in the baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what it did then is it turned it into
this caramel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because THC will boil at 177 degrees is
what Tony told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he showed me a link on his River Rock
Wellness Center page.
[SPEAKER_02]: On what the different temperatures do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I followed those instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the caramel beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff will just press and press.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 180.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 180 as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: No this is the 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the caramel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only knew because I had it in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was getting you a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see there's some more caramel there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all your dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the world of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Particularly foam out like pure headies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking we'd be here all week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you who would really be happy
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he was sitting right here right now
he'd have the biggest smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd be just doling his knees out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunkman Sam made on a session one of
these days when I come down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah well if you come to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's only come here one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was years ago when they even
harassed him at the border.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man I'm just recovering from the last hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's going to blow you out of
recovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll help you get out of recovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is really nice too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say dry sift is just different from
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are always like oh it's
way better it's way better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you only ever saw a killer dry
sift and only saw a mediocre bubble you
[SPEAKER_05]: would say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the nicest bubble is really on par
with the nicest dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: However they are different and the one
thing that dry sift really in a way is
[SPEAKER_05]: unique is that there's no footprint in the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no you don't lose any terpenes
like you do in water extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no breaching of the heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a unique method.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old method.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely it's not that hard to
learn how to do this and you don't need a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of material to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like even a small amount of herb you can
just play around on these small screens
[SPEAKER_05]: and learn how to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is it not a skill that you would
consider up there in your quiver of
[SPEAKER_05]: skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like going to college and getting a
degree in something and applying it and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing that what you learned works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we met a long time ago and we talked
about bubble bags and stuff and I bought
[SPEAKER_02]: one of those those screen sets and
everything before and the tumble now and I
[SPEAKER_02]: tried doing the thing and I thought the
stuff that was underneath the 70 was the
[SPEAKER_02]: killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like wow look how much I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking I'm smoking I'm like well
you know this is okay but you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: better finger rub better or you know and I
didn't really see what you were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it happened with a lot of people
for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just weren't quite getting it and I
think the photo essays were good for a
[SPEAKER_05]: small group of people that were really
gung-ho.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well for the perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for the perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the lucky guy you know the small
percentage which there are these guys and
[SPEAKER_05]: I really may be focused on them more than
I should and it's why I always say anyone
[SPEAKER_05]: can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that there's random dudes that just
like literally buy bags for the first time
[SPEAKER_05]: run their grow through it and get like
like the nicest hash that you could get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like nice as anything I've ever made or
smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me I just call it that's the nicest
hash in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean it's exclusive.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big pile up there of the night
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like hello nicest hash in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: For certain like no doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full melt contender at Legends I would
tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really should bring some dry sift to
Legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I'm gonna do everything I can to make
that happen because I do want to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: that trip for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah no that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the thing for me that turned me
on to the dry sift was coming down this
[SPEAKER_02]: last summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh with John.
[SPEAKER_02]: With John and sit with you and him and hit
that full melt dry sift looking at it and
[SPEAKER_02]: melting like like water and then I'm
sitting in John's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got ripped too often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got just fucked and I had to get on my
butt to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't just sit there and hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you drive like eight hours or
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just got on my bike and rode
some more because I could not sit still.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like too fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even John said to me did I get you too
high buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like no I'm good man I just want
to ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen did you get me too cooked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I ordered the screens and gave it
another set of screens and gave it a full
[SPEAKER_02]: 150% effort on it and did not stop until I
got the results I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that took a while didn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah like two three weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude you were persistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like like because you text me and I
was like why is he not what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: The material I was getting what I was
using I wasn't I just wasn't it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was using now and then when I
thought what I got was full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all yeah look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent him a video and he says to me well
it's it's starting to sizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: No that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to say oh that's a good
job Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get criticized for that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember when I first met Skunkman
Sam I felt like he was almost like a
[SPEAKER_05]: university professor or something like
when you were when you were wrong he was
[SPEAKER_05]: just like you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I appreciate it now looking back at
sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does help.
[SPEAKER_05]: It snaps you right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coddling you into doing
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're definitely doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sizzled and then I made
another little video after fucking around
[SPEAKER_02]: some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said yeah that is definitely
full melt because it bubbled and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbled some more and then it bubbled some
more and it just melted and it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: like holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely like 50 to 70 percent THC with
full terpene profile like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what what we're going to be taking
pictures of this week is going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooklyn mango above a Kush and OG Kush.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get some macro photos of some nice
plants here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might even be able to get a little bit of
video clips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out when we meet the folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what I'd like to show on those
videos what I'd like to show the world is
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're doing to get this growth of the
trichromes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most important spot and we're
doing that right from the stage of rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants to help to introduce and
improve the THC production on the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I'm sure people would be very
interested in specific details of like OK
[SPEAKER_05]: what do you do at this point at this point
and at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me I haven't grown in so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why I don't give much grow advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew for years and I do now have my
license.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because our licenses are potentially
going to be taken away from us in the next
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ending on my birthday if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't be able to do that to
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's not going to be able
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think they're talking about
regulating voltages and amounts of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many people are growing so many
amounts of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need you know like thousands of
pounds or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely like the idea of
production license producers great and
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution network great for you know
elderly people and maybe even like kids
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be a whole group of people
that love that but also dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_05]: essential.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a grassroots organization that
is necessary component because there's so
[SPEAKER_05]: many of them that open up that you're able
to choose where you want to go and find a
[SPEAKER_05]: variety of strains that maybe one license
producer could never really have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also of course the right for us to be
able to grow plants you know like 98
[SPEAKER_05]: plants or something just under 100 and
obviously you know throw a light limit on
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know if you if you have a 98 plant
license maybe that's 20 lights you know
[SPEAKER_05]: not 100 because that's what a lot of
people were doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just throw up a light for every plant that
you're allowed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so license production facilities can
do that when you need to grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for everyone else and the reason I
think the dispensaries will really reign
[SPEAKER_05]: superior is that the grassroots growers
that grow that herb for those dispensaries
[SPEAKER_05]: are so many and they grow such a small
amount and they do it right that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: able to produce a level and a quality of
cannabis that most not all but most
[SPEAKER_05]: production level facilities can't touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't mean not all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in 50 and 100 plus lighters that
were like absolutely growing like grade A
[SPEAKER_05]: herb like just like whatever they call it
now quadruples, quads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day it was the trips back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway we're gonna get going.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna continue to puff here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a few things to do I guess to
gear up for the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to get this video uploaded right
away and part two will be coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
you you
