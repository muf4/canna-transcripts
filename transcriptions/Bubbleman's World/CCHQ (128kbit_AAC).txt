[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bowman's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're heading downtown and we're
going to go meet up with, well hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll see Dana Larson from Sensible BC and
Original Cannabis Culturer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see maybe Jody and Jeremiah down
at Pot TV along with Marijuana Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely going to be seeing Matt the
Great Gardener and John Berfello.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were supposed to maybe do a little bit
of a show on Pot TV with Jeremiah there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but today I wanted to actually talk to you
guys a little bit about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we show you a lot of the main stuff with
how the cannabis is grown, how it's
[SPEAKER_04]: processed, how the hash is made,
how the hash is cleaned, but I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: really shown you a simple thing like how
do I get the hash back to the Great
[SPEAKER_04]: Gardener without it turning into a giant
puck of garbage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is how ridiculous you gotta roll
when you're rolling with Full-Melt Dry
[SPEAKER_04]: Sift, particularly of the caliber of the
Great Gardener's Full-Melt Dry Sift,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so greasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You literally have to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have multiple ice packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the three containers, the seconds
on top, the first on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is I guess what you call thirds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couple of different grades and then a
cooking grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another giant thing of ice here
and I've got an ice pack that it's all
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting on and it's inside a cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what you have to do if you want
to hope to have a chance on getting,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to give this to Matt and
I want it to be powder, perfect powder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want it to be all clumped up and
greasy and I just prefer it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what you gotta do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get yourself a cooler, get yourself some
ice packs, make sure you get that dry sift
[SPEAKER_04]: into a container that's sealed in every
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want any moisture getting into
your dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the great things about dry sift is
you don't have to dry it so it would be a
[SPEAKER_04]: shame to get moisture in your dry sift and
then be forced to dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that note, I think we're gonna have
a D-nail rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a tiny bit of the barb dry sift here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just rolled it into kind of a little puck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be able to dab that quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little mini hit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitting it through the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll clean that dabber up and we'll
hit a little of the Astro Boy Fresh Frozen
[SPEAKER_04]: that John and I made the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's always in order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little Astro Boy chaser to my 99%
barb dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to go out into town the other
day and just give a few key friends a
[SPEAKER_04]: taste of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend Frank Hoover, my buddy Marijuana
Man, the original Marijuana Man,
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg from PotTV, and as well as John B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always gotta share with John B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm gonna head downtown and we'll
catch up with you guys down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I've just arrived down on the pot
block and I'm gonna head on over to the
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, are they setting up over there yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Marty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey how's it going dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, how you doing buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think I'm gonna set up over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going Marius?
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to film some PotTV-age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up Marty?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going dude?
Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for a session?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see upstairs, I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremiah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got quite the fucking show today too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you working hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking rights dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working damn hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see you, I see the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw off the phone with Mr. Enrico
Bouchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's Enrico doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna call in the show live from jail
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's doing okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bail's high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he hasn't had that hearing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have put the charges on him for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're saying basically that he sold
a couple packs of seeds to an undercover
[SPEAKER_01]: officer and he also sold a couple packs of
seeds to these people who started this
[SPEAKER_01]: grow operation apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they got him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enrico isn't a seed seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the inventor of the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed thing was just that a friend
called him and was wondering if he could
[SPEAKER_01]: get some seeds for these people and he
just did a favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The friend was a narc?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess somebody narc'd and there was an
undercover officer involved somehow and
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow Enrico got it all pinned on him
that he was selling seeds to this big grow
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Enrico beforehand had verified that
they were medical patients, that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: using this for their sickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were supposedly to take it home and
grow it in their own garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't meant to be some big grow
operation where people were selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's gonna call in while we're on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna call in during the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the crazy thing is that they've been
using our video that we shot on PawTV of
[SPEAKER_01]: Enrico in the strain hunter's vehicle and
stuff, like playing it on the TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this seems like kind of one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do the cops ever go after seed
dealers?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's seed companies on every fucking
block.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like several seed companies out
here on the street right in front of us
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I always think that it's a specific
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably fell right into their lap and
then they decided well let's just let's
[SPEAKER_04]: get 80 different cops to work on this for
the next six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll spend like you know like 400k.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll make a big news story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what it is and Enrico
happens to be a guy who's gaining some
[SPEAKER_01]: notoriety and the pop movie's probably
becoming more popular out there in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name's making it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they know where to go to find
footage of him on PawTV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to do a bong rip?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit this bong right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright let's hit it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I believe this is, I was told this is,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seedman's Haze crossed with Nepalese,
the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a little bit of butter that was
given to me as a gift sprinkled on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom falazi.
Boom falazi?
[SPEAKER_02]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so I just got to the BCMP,
the vapor lounge here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bumped into Melwin who was at the
booth at 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got his buddy Johnny here and
Sarah who's hiding kind of behind him
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we all are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to do some D-Nail rips guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a nice clean straight fab cup of
water that you may have thought was for
[SPEAKER_04]: moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get lazy with the D-Nail on the
cleaning of the piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today I just thought, that's nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first up, Fresh Frozen Astro Boy that I
grew myself and washed a couple days ago
[SPEAKER_04]: with John B.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucking awesome ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to use it when you have
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marius is cranking the tunes for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not every day you get the pop resin
that I grew myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't grown in almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little bit high profile as bubble man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really able to do certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now with the license, it's a little
bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like dessert.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dessert now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really hide it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, once again, just like John B,
he uses cannabis exclusively for his pain
[SPEAKER_04]: medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look who just got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Matt is in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: The great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: And my responsibility is almost complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, people have no idea about
this aspect of how ridiculous this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed them earlier on the start part of
this video of how many ice packs I had to
[SPEAKER_04]: put into here to keep this hash from
greasing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have two ice packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to borrow one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ice packs that I brought
knowing that the grease up factor within
[SPEAKER_00]: five minutes happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that one that you're gonna
want to be... Although I'd be surprised if
[SPEAKER_04]: it was... I did things a little
differently this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got less seconds and it's nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then surprisingly...
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, while the one is out,
just put it into the ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it really is just a moment of
getting nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's do a rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting out there, the sun shifts,
comes through, the shade goes away,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sun beats on it for like 18 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a brick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never gonna be... There's something
nice about the way he's shaking it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and just moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way I wish...
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people in Spain and all over the
place, when I have it, I always talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you guys could come here and
experience it when it's in powder form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing everything we can to invent
ways of getting it in powder form out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: The numbers... It was about 135 grams when
this tub was full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cleaned 23 grams of seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cleaned 40 grams of thirds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cleaned 66 grams, or 66.7 grams of
first 99% heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that ratio was 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was some pretty clean sieve that
was already 50% heads before I got ahold
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I cleaned out 50% of that material and
now Barbara is truly...
[SPEAKER_04]: able to show her quality when she's
combined with a proper purity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: My whole house reeks like a bar of 99%
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was being religious about keeping it
cool and going into the freezer right
[SPEAKER_04]: away.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, my whole freezer also smells like
99%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would get a colder freezer for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it literally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally, but I mean at certain
temperatures like minus three or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God you can still smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still smell the terpenes
evaporating at minus four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some volatile oils, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want the ice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense, want that too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cracking it up for travel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's an important thing done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check us out at our booths at Champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: 222.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm 519 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: 519, I've been shouting out 222 to
everyone for the last like four days.
[SPEAKER_04]: 519, I'm 506 and John's 407.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our booths are combined.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll all be in a fairly close area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely come check us out at Champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Champs is going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm on a panel on Friday with
Simon from Serious Seeds and the Joint
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's I think Friday at 2.30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure I film that so you guys can
check it out on Bulberman's Grove.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you got a plane to catch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a plane to catch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for, well here, let me give you one
quick round.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you everybody in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me give you, this is right
here, my fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one you just made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not every day I get to give Matt the great
gardener some resin that I personally grew
[SPEAKER_04]: and washed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly don't mind cleaning up after
that hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wait for John B to show up
and we're going to go film with Jeremiah
[SPEAKER_04]: from 420 News.
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Johnny's in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, these guys are setting up for
Jeremiah's PotTV 420 News.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Marius over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's about to take a rip of his,
of what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of those bronies.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a brony.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just gave Matt the great gardener his dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's bringing the champs, the 99% pure
sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I bumped into John and he's got some
My Little Pony fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it's 73 or 90 or what not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to get a piece from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might have to double that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it nice?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to split these two nice rips here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn my camera off now and
we're going to go on Jeremiah's show here
[SPEAKER_04]: in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see you over there guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about that for a deja vu,
John?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had a delicious meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herb crush salmon for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the salmon rice bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: The barbecue salmon rice bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the rice bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't too happy with the barbecue salmon.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about those appetizers with the ahi
tuna tacos and the sushi cones?
[SPEAKER_04]: They come in a regular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, what would you guys like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I think it's just more of a,
why aren't you getting lobster grilled
[SPEAKER_05]: cheese?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten it for a while now and
I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to try different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been hitting it up for dinner lately
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So John and I just finished the PotTV
episode there with Jeremiah on his news,
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 News, cannabis culture news.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a quick hand and note and say
hello, talk about the chance coming up
[SPEAKER_05]: event and discussing doctors prescriptions
and how they're educating doctors across
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada to prescribe cannabis for different
conditions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was a good little show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talked about champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talked about Enrico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting messed up with a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not on that level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are we hitting there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, whatever it is, he left me none.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a tiny little rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a whole other jar of ash for
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: He left me the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never mess around when it comes to John.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, how was the hash that I gave you
last time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it still?
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, after, you know, he's like,
here, I'll give you a little bit of hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm gonna fill up the container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It lasted me like a month and everybody
knows how much I puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's actually hash left in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna heat up this side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will help dab a friend up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds very nice, don't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: We drove around the block here for about a
couple of rounds before we realized
[SPEAKER_04]: there's some huge movie or TV show
filming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've literally got every parking
spot blocked off as not a parking spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, for the last six minutes,
we've been parked illegally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought, what better thing to do
while you're parking?
[SPEAKER_04]: We parked illegally in Vancouver,
but to smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: While people walk by and look in the
vehicle and think, what the fuck are those
[SPEAKER_02]: guys doing in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a bad look?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of just like, I think those
guys are dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually us smoking full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that smells nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tasty, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: See what the difference is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to have a dessert hit after.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful dessert hash like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: No coughing, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Job well done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm gonna head my way.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's got some rush hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, worse than rush hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rush hour, long weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traffic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rush hour, though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I guess that's over at five.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might take me a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might pop in, but I'm gonna try and get
my upload done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing an upload today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out John on his channel at John
H.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfello, YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been uploading some bubble hash
making videos, and dry sift videos,
[SPEAKER_04]: and growing videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just all the things that you want to see
John doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, once again, buddy, it was a pleasure
hanging out with you and bumping into you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna head off my way, you head off
yours, and we will see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you guys.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Thanks for watching.
