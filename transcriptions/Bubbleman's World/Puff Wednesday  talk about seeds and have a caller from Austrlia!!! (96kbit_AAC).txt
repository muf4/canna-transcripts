[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bullahman's World and
welcome to Puff Wednesday with the one and
[SPEAKER_04]: only John Berfello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, what a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a gorgeous day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we always find ourselves in a
different place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's always nice to be
surrounded by these beautiful girls.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are surrounded by beautiful girls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful girls today, indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a pretty chill Puff Wednesday on
the menu for tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're going to go over a little bit
of seeds that we were gifted from a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get back to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have actually a caller
potentially call in during 420 today,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is in about five or 10 minutes,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, that was the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a caller, a guy named Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Australia and he called out
yesterday, gave me a call and wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, special thanks to Mark and myself for
what we're doing in the education and
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to let us know that Australia is
really big fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Australia's got some,
they're loving the education.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're loving, we're getting a message
out and they're really appreciative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, well, why don't you call in
today, Joe?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see if Joe calls in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something a little different on
Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have someone call in and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He has some questions to ask about some
things that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it would be a good time to
just give us a call in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, maybe next time you'll call in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might start doing a call in type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we do, we'll produce a number or a
Skype account that you can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think it'd be cool to hear from
you guys every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially on a Puff Wednesday where we
don't necessarily have the best show lined
[SPEAKER_04]: up, but we still want to share
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still want to share our content with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, dabs, we've got our dabs out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're surrounded in my strains right now,
the strains that John has shared,
[SPEAKER_04]: the strains that Great Gardener has
shared, strains that I've collected myself
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years, and even strains that some
other friends have collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, John's got the Horold Phytolaxie
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of got this triple leaf thing
happening now for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was doing two for the first four and
then it split into a three.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Jamaican right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lower mutant leaves starting to look
healthier up top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice dark color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about that, that,
that, that tripod with the three and
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently it's what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, one of our viewers pointed it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had heard of it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just sort of, when Simon was over the
other day and he said, Oh, you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: triploid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's basically what he meant was
the Horold Phytolaxie minus the actual,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no, been no genome done on the
plant to find out exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a triploid is apparently a
genetic and you need to do a test to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Simon is someone in the know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today we are going to dab up some
flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the, the six and a half year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my God, look at this, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just watched that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just shows you how long hash
actually it will last for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stable, stable hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is sitting in the heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is six and a half years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's really, I think we should
start with a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually like to, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long day so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, you know, talking about the next
conference coming up and a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of, a lot, a lot of good things
happening nowadays with all the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are being helped with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently in the news was a two year old
toddler that we talked about previously
[SPEAKER_02]: when we went two chances.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just posted that on my Facebook page
today and it was shared over 55 times
[SPEAKER_04]: within, I don't know, this is you.
[SPEAKER_04]: In such a short period, I was,
it's a touching story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this, this little girl has gone
for 23 days without a seizure,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is when you see her grandmother and
her mother kind of bursting into tears on
[SPEAKER_04]: camera, you realize how intense it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time she has a brain seizure,
her brain actually is deteriorating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's slowly killing her.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis is literally now not just a
curative, but is now becoming a lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis saves lives every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, where I peeled that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's red and it's gooey.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get to see that,
which I'm sorry you didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bubble in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the taste for something six
years old?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause everyone wants to know how much
taste can be left.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be stale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not stale, it's like a minty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the opposite of stale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, the flavor for whatever
reason has enhanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you age something and you like like
an aged wine or, or even, I know referring
[SPEAKER_02]: to oils and, and, and, and I guess alcohol
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what's in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turpines are anyways, long story
short, it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a nice treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spend six years holding onto
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day you get to share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a special day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't really, really think of a
person I would rather share it with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good buddy, puffing with him all the time,
sharing his meds with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just stoked on inspiring each other
to be kinder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally John and I have inspired each
other to be better people since we've met
[SPEAKER_04]: and hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's sharing and, and well for me,
it's always been about education and of
[SPEAKER_02]: how long on the strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I've learned from,
from, from you, my friend is you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: share what works so well for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I, you know, I did a video the
other day and I passed on some genetics to
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim and awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just slowly getting them out there
and letting people know, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it works, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't try something else,
the flavor on this is over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a treat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like I should bring some to
legends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to be entered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would specifically say this isn't
entered.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just, this is just, I want
everyone at legends to have some of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: it'll be almost seven years old by then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking how much we're going
to help between now and legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's true.
I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling, maybe we should hit this
barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually brought, um, of course I was
carrying some health, the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That JT.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The JT 15 love the JT 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to hit that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought some midi.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: John, no slouch for fellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought some one 90 and 73 from the fresh
first run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to hit that first one?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm expecting this week to get the
new camera that Aurora so kindly,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, pre-purchased for me in exchange for
some beautiful photographs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's been a few days since I really
managed to take some good photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's probably been over a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have taken a few with my, um,
my older camera, but I'm just not feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The inspiration is not there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really looking forward to getting
this new camera so I can just get back on
[SPEAKER_04]: the photography, get back on the daily and
weekly updates on all the different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains, get on more macro photography,
show you guys more resin, show you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: more, more melting videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I get the ceramic disc
back, you know, I find it's hard to set up
[SPEAKER_04]: the camera for a good melt shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this particular quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard for me to cut Mark off and
tell him that it's actually a one minute
[SPEAKER_02]: warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was going to do the one minute
warning because people need to know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: one minute before 420 and you need to be
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, uh, for me, it's, uh, I,
I like to medicate and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 for me, it's just, it's a nice time to
relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, look at all this awesome trash that
the whip is like just gently traversing
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's one thing what's nice about
the whip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does work well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see if Joe gives us a call here at
420 and, um, that'll be exciting to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to someone from Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, is it, is it right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're out watching, grab your bong,
grab your, grab yourself a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the one minute before warning for
token.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I get to do the 420 token.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you are for a carb cap senior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sun's beaten down real nice on the
Vancouver lower mainland these past week,
[SPEAKER_04]: week and a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's saving me because I only have so much
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm many, many, many plants under my
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even grow half the plants that I'm
legally allowed to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not about the amount of plants
that you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I don't want to try and get into a
situation where I have more plants than I
[SPEAKER_04]: can, than I can care for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when the bugs and the mildews and
all these different things move in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I'm fighting with a little
bit right now, um, just like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: once in a while, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, just getting down the
nitty gritty and a few of my plants got a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in there daily working on stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you got to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I keep my mom's, uh,
even these right now are bushier than I
[SPEAKER_04]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably chop them down real soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, I've kind of let them get a little
bit bigger because I have a feeling that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be able to, when I cut these
down, share them out rather than throw
[SPEAKER_04]: them all away.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you've done this, where you can
cut these tops off and these bottoms can
[SPEAKER_02]: explode and it's very nice and how you set
up your moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm going to say kudos,
congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you did a good job there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they're growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just pruned them up real nice,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is way too thick right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to get in here and, and clean
this up a little bit, but it, how many
[SPEAKER_04]: clones and how many growth sites there are
in here is absolutely awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love growing that herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so I guess we're going to hit a few
more bowls and we'll come back in a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: and tell them about, uh, those seeds that
we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, is that call coming through?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Australia guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got a call from Joe from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing puff Wednesdays here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Joe?
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great if we had a phone that we're
just, uh, experienced a little technical
[SPEAKER_04]: difficulty here.
I'm sorry.
There's a little bit of a lag between here
and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just, uh, we're just set up out on
my deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just, we're filming this right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're on puff Wednesday with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can say hi to everyone in YouTube
land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude, we, we love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you have beauty in Australia as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have no shortage with the Great
Barrier Reef and all the epic rainforest
[SPEAKER_04]: that you guys have going on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have you been living in
Australia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you ever come to Canada,
you can definitely look us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got to look you guys up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to look up my brother,
Freddy, uh, Pitchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I said, I've been in the
background for, ever since the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hadn't been for Freddy, I probably
would have never stayed on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was kind of drugged up on a lot
of medicines that the doctors give me back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he taught me a new way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it hadn't, like I said,
if it hadn't been for Freddy, I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have stayed on the internet, which in turn
met my wife and she's an Australian and
[SPEAKER_00]: she came and got me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I've been over here ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, it is an absolute beautiful
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, my first video that
I'm going to put up, I'm going to make in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nimbus and I want everybody to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm going to the Nimbus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to go to the Mardi Gras or
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going there when that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I didn't make it this year,
um, because of my leg and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm having a little bit of problems
with my back and leg and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I said, I've been, listen guys,
I've been watching everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray Moe, the original marijuana man,
way back when you had to have real
players, you know, on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be on those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You must've seen the old Jamaican videos
then.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: there it is right there, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check her out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting up on the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to look at it on this,
uh, next episode of Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just took a good look at it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So listen, we really, we're stoked that
you called in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope that you, we hope that you share a
bowl with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, uh, we're ready to dab it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of in a bit of a uncomfortable
position holding the phone to the camera,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, we're super stoked that you
called us and shared your story with us
[SPEAKER_04]: and are getting to know us, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate the kind words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing a bowl here with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: John will take care of you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cough now for a bit,
but we got to get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're super thankful that you called in
and, uh, we hope we'll hear from you more
[SPEAKER_04]: in the comments and stuff.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was a really nice, uh,
call in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe seemed like a super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was, uh, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having Joe call in like that on the,
uh, on the puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday was our first time having that
had Joe call me last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was telling me about, um, well he's,
he's being injured.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got back problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's had one of his legs amputated.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on heavy pharma and now he's just
cannabis for pain control and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and him moving to Australia was with a
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just so much better for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, sounds pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was explaining, how, uh,
yeah, he was, he was talking about how we
[SPEAKER_02]: started doing the bubble bags and how we
learned from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how he was, uh, using for his
pain control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was watching you from day one,
like he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, he was, he was very humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, you know what,
you guys are like legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, to him, it was, uh,
he was, uh, Mark's like a celebrity and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I assure you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I said, Mark, Mark is a humble
servant of Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark is a guy that loves the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like with me, I love when you have a
passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've seen a lot of people come and
go in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I find that to the ones that
really have the true passion are the,
[SPEAKER_04]: are the ones that, uh, that stick through
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a truly amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does so much for us as we all know,
and the, and the more and more research
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming out with them and the
information and people all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're educating themselves and watching
Old Man's World and learning about the
[SPEAKER_02]: different equities of, uh, different
strains for different conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course doing it legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best part about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world is changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been less than 10 years ago
that John and I both literally jumped up
[SPEAKER_04]: like maniacs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we'd be running with this plant
into the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: About to fly over the deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, probably the RC.
[SPEAKER_04]: MP traffic helicopter, which is the one
that flies over the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: No concern of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have about six plants, seven plants out
of my deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: My grows right there, 15 feet away where
they really actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six is actually 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: John wants to make specifics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got some planted in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we love them is no specifics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's funny is, uh, uh, we were talking
about the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, how many mums you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got four, four lead into about 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kept counting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the old mom problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure some of you guys have it out
there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why another great thing of sharing
your strains with your friends is the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to not have to hold all the moms
at one place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have them broken up amongst
different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that way you don't need to mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to mom out all the ones I'm
moming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to mom out your strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just like, we can share the
strains without it made it easier for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause recently that was really my problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of like, what am I going to do
with all these Medi Hayes and the Haas and
[SPEAKER_04]: the OG Rom and the, you know, the My
Little Pony, two Finos, two Finos,
[SPEAKER_04]: a Haas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was becoming quite a bit just of your
strains alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already had a Barb, an Afghani,
a Congo and a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those four for sure, along with Astro Boy
and East Coast Sour Diesel, which is now
[SPEAKER_04]: six, that I wanted to mother and keep for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything really, for me on top of that
is more moms than I have space for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be a cool license to have actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_04]: They let us have licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They let us have home grows and they let
us have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we start a new kind of company,
much like the THC Bank or whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: clone, I can't remember what they're
called, but much like the concept where
[SPEAKER_04]: you just have houses, mothers,
you just house mothers of strains and
[SPEAKER_04]: those strains would become available to
not only licensed producers, but also home
[SPEAKER_04]: growers and even dispensaries that wanted
to go and buy, you know, a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: pallets wholesale and sell them off at a
small profit to their, to their patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I think it's just that's the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole thing is you're
having your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So saying this now, we're going to look
back with a vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said that like five years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it seems like it is starting to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting into strain pacifics for
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at the different values,
the medical values of each individual
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really you just can't have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: The profiles are so complex that it's just
hard for them to take one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to take one plant and make it
everything that they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, if they can do that,
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I accept that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also want the availability of the
whole plant and the whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_04]: to the people that wanted in those forms,
the land raised and the hybrids,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like non GMO and just like what we
have today, let us at least have what we
[SPEAKER_04]: have today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll accept anything new down the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as that new thing doesn't push out
the old, you know, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this idea of a quiver, you know,
more rather than less.
[SPEAKER_04]: That works for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you just rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Under pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of moisture on the top there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to cure your,
uh, although you probably don't want all
[SPEAKER_01]: that moisture going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that just, um, I had a fresh jar
that I have wrapped up of the watermelon
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had it wrapped up and never got into
sifting this actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out the sun here and it,
uh, steamed right up and moisture and she
[SPEAKER_02]: popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a phone call.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go see if it's another cool
call in for puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to call him back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a friend calling, uh,
about a new project that John and I are
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially starting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we probably aren't really allowed to
say much just yet, but trust me,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys will hear about it first here
on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, uh, we're going to get that
call.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to look at those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on our way to go look at the seeds
when we got the call.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go look at those seeds and check
that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I brought the seeds out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was sent to us from, um, medical
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys, these guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Javier from, uh, Barcelona and his whole
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really great people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, got some great strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has sent, geez, it looks like his
entire catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: An Igriega CBD, the 1024, the devil fruit,
the pure Igriega, the Jack Lamatta,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mendocino purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this one's supposed to be
Shannon or channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure the name of this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Malik off the BCN, the Barcelona sour
diesel, the 2046, the Prozac and the white
[SPEAKER_03]: widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last but not least.
[SPEAKER_04]: No name.
[SPEAKER_02]: No name.
[SPEAKER_03]: No name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one that we want to pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Igriega CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: 1024, devil fruit,
[SPEAKER_03]: Igriega, Jack Lamatta,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, winded, trying to blow away on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chan, chain, Chanet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malik off Barcelona sour diesel 2046
Prozac
[SPEAKER_03]: white widow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just took you through the medical
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: 13 varieties from Javier and the medical
seeds crew in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're around Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or check out their seeds, do a little
Google search.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, they're winning awards in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and in other countries as well,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So John, I think we're going to go over
the, the dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dynasty just sent me a nice little gift
pack and they sent me, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sent me their dynasty genetics,
salmon river OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who doesn't love OGs?
[SPEAKER_04]: John loves OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sent me this one, the caramel OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking more OGs for goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also sent me the dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue-niverse, blue mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Magoo crossed with Miss Universe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue-niverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice looking seeds too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are nice looking seeds right there,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but certainly not least,
I love when it says reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huckleberry OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if any of you guys can tell us about
these, if any of you guys are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: dynasty genetics, whether you're growing
the blue-niverse, the caramel OG,
[SPEAKER_04]: the salmon river OG, or the Huckleberry OG
reserve, let us know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've, I saw the quality photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known a few people who have grown
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't personally seen the bud or the
resin yet, but yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got a long list of genetics to
crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: John and I are trying to figure out a way
to get ourselves a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_04]: get a company going where we can do a
little R and D and that way we could start
[SPEAKER_04]: cracking all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's just right now it would be
crazy to crack these seeds without a place
[SPEAKER_04]: to really properly grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing, right?
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are going to go into the bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can hold onto seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had my Jamaican one for 20 years and
it's growing right now behind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully these get planted in the next
six months to a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to thank dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to thank medical seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sending out the treats guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess we're, uh, we've been gone
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: After we showed you the seeds there,
we had some pretty nice, uh, conference
[SPEAKER_04]: calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things are furthered from our
mention in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're definitely going to be heading to
Jamaica at the end of this month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're excited to bring you some bubble
man's world from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe have a puff Wednesday down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a bunch of other fun experiences bump
into maybe some of the reggae artists that
[SPEAKER_04]: I met over the last couple of years
heading down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to be doing a puff
Wednesday in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you'll see a bunch of
recognizable characters from the community
[SPEAKER_04]: down there with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't talk about it too much,
but there's some exciting things in the
[SPEAKER_04]: works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's after we go to Toronto for the
next gen conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hope that any of you guys out there
from Toronto, um, are going to come and
[SPEAKER_04]: see us at the next gen conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to, you know, talk to you,
love to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always inspired and stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we were in Toronto, those guys
were so nice to invite us to their garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really, you know, and,
uh, got an email coming back, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: give a special thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was, um, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an awesome email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were inspired by our education and,
and, and what our values are and what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're about in our direction and how we're
trying to reach you, everybody else around
[SPEAKER_02]: us, exactly this great plant and how
medicinal and how, uh, it helps people so
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the whistle on that helps me every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, um, um, Josh Stanley from the
Stanley brothers will be speaking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: green rush conference coming up,
uh, from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the, uh, Charlotte's web strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be some interesting people
talking more on the medical, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal strains of hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be, that'll be good to see them
over in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a great medical line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, myself will be talking
yourself, of course, uh, just go check out
[SPEAKER_02]: the green rush conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, come check us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be at the convention center on the
26th.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if any of you guys are in Jamaica,
Hey, you know, after that, probably around
[SPEAKER_04]: the 30th till the fifth or six,
we will be down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be very busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a bunch of things on our plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not going to keep us from
showing you as much awesome Jamaican
[SPEAKER_04]: content as we can possibly bring you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to step it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that if, um, if I'm able to get
down there and meet my buddy Tony,
[SPEAKER_04]: who we were with in, in Spain,
if he's able to come down and bring a film
[SPEAKER_04]: crew or bring his camera, then we will
definitely be able to film the second part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the documentary started in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't forgotten about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm still actually editing Spanish dot
video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part six is getting edited right now and
it will be, um, it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: mismatched because it's footage that
wasn't really going to be filmed
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically for editing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Tony has the majority of the footage,
so I have little bits and pieces from my
[SPEAKER_04]: camera of us heading over to the ripper
seeds guys place and whipping off a batch
[SPEAKER_04]: of wet wash bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also clean, Oh geez,
it must've been a three or 400 grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: dry sift for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was definitely a legendary
moment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of a highlight for the trip
when I kicked everyone out and I quickly,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as fast as I possibly could
manage to clean that resin up to an
[SPEAKER_04]: absolute wonderful purity, separated out
into piles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they came out back into the room,
five or 10 minutes later, they were all
[SPEAKER_04]: just like, these are fun things that we
experience when we're away on our trips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that this Jamaica trip is going
to be, I mean, is it a coincidence?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we crack the 20 year old
Jamaican seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about Jamaica and Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about Jamaica and Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been talking about Jamaica for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I talked to you, you're like
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is being about Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're a cannabis
enthusiast, if you're into this scene,
[SPEAKER_04]: this industry, it's hard not to go to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never been.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to get to get you there,
John, and just look at your, I'm excited
[SPEAKER_04]: expressions and reactions to just the most
awesome, wonderful people, incredible
[SPEAKER_04]: culture, awesome music.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm personally stoked on the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of vegetarian options for me
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, all around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and me, I'm, I'm waiting to learn how
the love of Jamaica is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I predict John will want to move there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I predict you'll want to move there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to move everywhere after 48.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, but this one's going to be like,
you have to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can work here maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, I just might do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be hanging on Jamaica more than I
am in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bottom line, tons of exciting stuff
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're glad that you're sharing it with
us here on Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope that you guys keep watching the
show and we're going to try and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: filming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to keep filming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see them next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, bubble on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't push record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm not that bad of a movie yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't push record.
I didn't push record.
I didn't push record.
