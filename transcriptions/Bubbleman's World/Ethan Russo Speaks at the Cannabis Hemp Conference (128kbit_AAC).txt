Thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid we're going to be moving from
the sublime to the ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't disagree with any philosophy
you've heard so far this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come to you certainly as an icon of the
establishment, but that is not the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also may be dressed in a suit,
but in my heart I'm wearing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my email is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who know me will admit that I
answer my email, so please feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that down if you have subsequent
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be busy, but I will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, we're talking about the
plant cannabis sativa, cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, it relates to the end
cannabinoid system, so we have this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't put on God's green earth to get
us high, because the plant has been around
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot longer than the human species,
but through a convenient accident of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, it makes chemicals that react with
our own receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cannabinoid receptors,
CB1, the psychoactive receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and CB2, an immunomodulatory and
pain-relieving receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this works is, one chemical in
particular in cannabis, THC, resembles
[SPEAKER_00]: natural cannabinoids within us,
the endogenous, or endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: best known as arachidonal glycerol,
anandamide, and 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bind to the receptors in the same
way that THC does, and the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is composed of those endogenous
chemicals, these receptors, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that make them and break them
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's been a great deal of
confusion about what we should call
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond the hundreds of slang terms,
frequently you'll hear, this is indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this is all nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go into the nitty-gritty of what
is a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that all cannabis can interbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you really need to know is,
what's in it and what will its effects be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that depends to a certain
extent on the internal milieu,
[SPEAKER_00]: the set and setting, these ineffable
things that we try to affect, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to describe the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it short?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it broad-leafed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it narrow-leafed?
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, what are its components,
not just the cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk today a great deal
about cannabis as, beyond THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other components that synergize and,
if you will, really make it a gift to
[SPEAKER_00]: humanity rather than a bunch of chemicals,
which is the way it's going to sound as I
[SPEAKER_00]: describe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know the terpenoid content,
the essential oils that give cannabis its
[SPEAKER_00]: unique scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to know the smell and taste
and, most importantly, the effects that it
[SPEAKER_00]: might provide, particularly from a
therapeutic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: One manner of classification that I've
found most useful is this one that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from neighbor research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you concentrate on the panel on the
right, you'll see that there are a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of sections that describe the percentages
of the cannabinoids and terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: their proportions, a picture of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, in the third panel, you see
something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other plants, in this instance,
a lemon and some peppercorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is because the terpenoid content of
limonene from lemons and karyophylline
[SPEAKER_00]: from black pepper are also common to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the third panel, you see nice
colored wedges that give an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: people have reported in terms of the
effect that this has had.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the left third panel, you see a
description of the smell and taste when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's inhaled, preferably by vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom panel is most interesting to me
because I think the terpenoids have been
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored, and these are really the refined
aspects of cannabis that give each type a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemover, a chemical variety, sometimes
misnamed strains, give them their unique
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, you'll see it's very
high in limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is likely to produce an effect as an
antidepressant and bright agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The karyophylline, the blue, very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be an agent that affects
CB2, produces anti-information and reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at the bottom, you see a very narrow
purple bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercy is usually predominant in most
chemovers of cannabis and is responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for the couchlock and sedation that is all
to come with most commercial types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, there's so much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we follow through this panel,
which comes from an upcoming book,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did with Jeanne Marcoux,
we move from the plant into the leaf to
[SPEAKER_00]: the unfertilized female flower,
and particularly in the upper right to its
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, the real action area of the
cannabis flower, where the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenoids are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, we have the beautiful
chemistry of the seeds, even the sprouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots have none of the same chemicals
that are in the flowers and vice versa,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also have remarkable healing
power that heretofore has been largely
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored in modern societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemistry part.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the phytocannabinoids,
the plant cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a bunch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most familiar are going to be THC and
cannabidiol, but all of these depicted
[SPEAKER_00]: here have had sufficient investigation to
know what their pharmacological effects
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the therapeutic effects may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the biosynthetic pathway by which
the cannabinoids are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go through in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on one precursor,
one of the parent chemicals, geranyl
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrophosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, this is a parent chemical,
not just to the cannabinoids, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: follow it to the right, it also is a
parent compound for the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids and terpenoids are half
siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I like to say, unlike in some blended
families, they get along beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is going to be most
familiar to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many people and governments out
there that would like you to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pharmacology of cannabis relates
to this one chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so far from true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were true, in 1985, cannabis would
have disappeared because synthetic THC as
[SPEAKER_00]: Marinol became available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who has taken it will tell you it's
a lousy drug with no therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between the amount that
will produce benefit perhaps on symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: and the amount that produces side effects
is negligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, it can be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge margin of safety under the
right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does bind to CB1 in the brain and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, of course, has painkilling properties
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a bronchodilator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens up the lungs, and there used to
be cannabis cigarettes or asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke part wasn't helpful,
but the THC was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond the receptor activity, it's a very
strong painkiller and anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20 times the anti-inflammatory
capacity of aspirin and twice that of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocortisone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is emulsory laxant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basis for its approval as side
effects as a prescription medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and 28 other countries around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's enantiomatic, particularly
in situations like chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend more time on
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC gets one slide today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got four on cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear it's non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't true because it does affect the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-anxiety agent that can
counteract the effect of too much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also an anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been now two phase two clinical
trials of either CBD alone or as an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract in treating schizophrenia with
less side effects than conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very interesting property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bind to the CB1 receptor,
but when it's around, even in tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts, it antagonizes the effect of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that may sound like a bad thing,
but it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's doing is counteracting some of
the less desirable effects of THC while
[SPEAKER_00]: also boosting its painkilling and
anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recently discovered that it does
this through being a negative allosteric
[SPEAKER_00]: modulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of saying it's not binding
here where THC does, but over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it produces lip long and
prosper, the two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just made that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a neuroprotective antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more powerful than vitamin C or
vitamin E in this regard and may in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future be used under conditions of insults
to the brain, whether it be strokes,
[SPEAKER_00]: head injury, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is what's called a TRV1 agonist,
like capsaicin, the active ingredient in
[SPEAKER_00]: chili peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important in treating a number of
neuropathic pain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of its primary effects over time may
be that it is a modulator of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It boosts the amount of endocannabinoid
anandamide and inhibits its breakdown over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a very powerful effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very strong anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that Epidiolex, which is a
predominantly cannabidiol extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be FDA approved later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem will be when we see what it
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned in the anti-anxiety agent,
in high doses, CBD shares with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids a unique ability to
selectively kill cancer cells while being
[SPEAKER_00]: preservative for normal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly 180 degrees from
conventional chemotherapy, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: generally toxic and you hope that you kill
the tumor before you lose all your hair or
[SPEAKER_00]: your gut lining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really needs to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it has a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 25 mechanisms of action that
account for it being a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally,
 how it works as an
anti-anxiety is mediated through
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As are a number of other effects,
including disturbances of thinking in
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced liver disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially, it could interfere with slow
viruses, mann cow disease and things of
[SPEAKER_00]: the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not the likelihood we'll ever
have a clinical trial on those disorders
[SPEAKER_00]: because, fortunately, they're pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recent one that's interesting is that
CBD promotes bone healing and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future it may be that this heretofore
forbidden drug is used to treat athletes
[SPEAKER_00]: that break limbs in sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a lot of misconceptions
about CBD and I've recently written an
[SPEAKER_00]: article specifically addressing those
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is some purveyors will say,
oh, it's got 0.5% CBD as if that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already addressed this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is psychoactive, it's non-intoxicating,
for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will commonly hear that it's sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure CBD is actually quite alerting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that most chemovers that
have cannabidiol in any amount also are
[SPEAKER_00]: very high in mercy, the couchlock factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has created a misconception there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have proof with EEGs and the like that
this is an alerting molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: South of the border, you'll commonly hear
some of the hemp-based CBD purveyors claim
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's legal in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is illegal in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the law has not been
prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say the way it should be because
I don't believe that at all, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know what the law actually says,
it is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem being that the Controlled
Substances Act allows hemp stalks and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if they're clean, but once you go
and extract chemicals from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is an exception to the exception and
they're illegal again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one, and this came up last year,
in an article where they simulated gastric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, exposed CBD to it for an hour and
got some of it to turn into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not happen in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hang around for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this reaction has been known
since 1940, it does not occur in the human
[SPEAKER_00]: body and you have no enzymatic equipment
to convert CBD into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows some of the same things,
the natural history from the hemp plant
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the pure crystalline chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see in the last part, your body
converts it into something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7-hydroxy-CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't convert it into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that in the test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, an agent you may have heard less
about, tetrahydrocannabivarin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is present in small amounts in
cannabis from southern Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa, Zimbabwe, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, it wasn't known how this
worked, but it's an interesting chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: in that at low concentrations,
it's an antagonist at CB1, what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral antagonist, so it's quite
different to remonaban, the weight loss
[SPEAKER_00]: drug that was subsequently yanked from the
market because of horrible side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually knocks down the activity of
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just occupies space in the receptor
and would allay hunger and help with the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic syndrome that is affecting so
many people in western societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown to produce weight loss
in the obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also strong anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a painkiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, aside from GW
Pharmaceuticals, which has a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: has 92% of its cannabinoids as THCV,
there's nothing analogous elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this could come about with selective
breeding, not with genetic modification,
[SPEAKER_00]: to which I'm totally against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, moving back for a second, THCV is like
THC but with a three-carbon side chain
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that brings us to CBDV,
cannabidiobarin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like CBD with a three-carbon side
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that CBD is an anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works on a different type of seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seizures of partial onset,
focal seizures, and it may be that the two
[SPEAKER_00]: together are going to make a better drug,
as presented in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you will also hear a lot about the
raw acid cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what the plant generally makes is not
THC, but THCA, tetrahydrocannabinoid acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will convert into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look carefully at literature of the
past, there were a lot of medical uses for
[SPEAKER_00]: raw cannabis that wasn't decarboxylated,
where you lose the CO2 group on the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This largely revolved around its
anti-inflammatory properties and abilities
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does something that THC does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects something called tumor necrosis
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important in certain autoimmune
diseases, inflammatory bowel conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: also rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, it's also been used successfully in
small amounts to treat seizure disorders
[SPEAKER_00]: that haven't responded to THC or CBD for
dominant preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why this is, isn't clear,
because there's a lot about this we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemingly does not cross the
blood-brain barrier, that filter system
[SPEAKER_00]: that keeps toxins out of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know in seizures that that breaks
down, and maybe it just gets in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extent it needs to in people that have
that kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's unclear whether this binds to
that CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some experiments have said yes,
others have said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inherently unstable molecule,
and so if it converts to THC, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some serious results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line, more study is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a counterpart in cannabidiolig acid
CBDA, so this is what CBD looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: before decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a natural herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamperetting ponds were infamous for
producing good weed killers, also killing
[SPEAKER_00]: worms and things of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be an extremely powerful
anti-emetic against nausea, about 100
[SPEAKER_00]: times more powerful than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it looks also, based on the
historical literature, that this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very effective agent in treating
tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the Renaissance herbalists
in Europe, they were always discussing raw
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp as a treatment for tumors,
so a great deal more work needed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taken from a 2011 article called
Taming THC, and you see again a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different familiar plants that depict
their representative scents that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the terpenoids are antibiotic,
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often things that work on emotions
and synergize with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monoterpenoids are the ones with 10
carbons, and you'll see that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: different structures, but what they have
in common is this 10-carbon structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: no nitrogen, and all odiferous,
very powerfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of fine print here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this to try and impress,
but we're not going to read all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to say about alpha-pinene is
it is much too little abundant in modern
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, particularly people my
age, the grey hairs, will wax prosaic
[SPEAKER_00]: about the cannabis of the past,
because remember that strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one where you could smoke as much as
you'd like, it'd still have a clear hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there isn't much of that around
these days, and the reason is a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: pinene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinene is an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetylcholin is the memory
neurotransmitter in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if it's broken down too rapidly,
you forget, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun if you need to forget how lousy
a day you had at work and what a prick
[SPEAKER_00]: your boss was, but under other conditions,
if you're in pain and have to work or
[SPEAKER_00]: study, you need this to counteract that
short-term memory impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, it's really a
phenomenal antibiotic, broad-spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just great for clearing the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Japanese have a wonderful term for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it shinrin-yoku, which is called
forest bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who has the fortune,
as most of us do, to live in the North
[SPEAKER_00]: West, when life gets you down,
you need to take a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like walking in an evergreen forest,
because that pining in the air is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: clear your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next, Mersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very useful molecule if you need
to sleep, and it does have analgesic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually is a very narcotic-like
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces a pain relief that responds
to naloxone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naloxone is the opioid blocker,
the same thing they give on the street on
[SPEAKER_00]: the east side to people who've overdosed
on heroin or fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all too prevalent due to
modern breeding techniques and produces
[SPEAKER_00]: this couch lock that, again, some people
like that, a lot of people don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, if you have to work or study,
it's just not conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightning I've mentioned before,
again, this is more common in the olden
[SPEAKER_00]: days, but certainly can be brought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all experienced this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk down the aisle in the
supermarket, there's a bunch of artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene in there, because
psychologically, we equate this with
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness and bright thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not just psychological.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is biochemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same thing by running your
thumb on a citrus rind of any variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll get the effect of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very powerful
antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Japan, they did an interesting trial,
hospitalized depressed patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut their depression scores in half,
got most of them off of their standard
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressant drug regimens, and it's
also a very powerful immune stimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some other effects that are still
being explored on a thing called adenosine
[SPEAKER_00]: 2A, where THC and CBD both work,
but through different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some kind of synergy going on
there that I, with my colleagues,
[SPEAKER_00]: are exploring now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linolol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, may be familiar for those of
you who still have grandmothers who may
[SPEAKER_00]: have had lavender about for its various
beneficial properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very powerful anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also spectacular local anesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cook, you should keep a bottle of
lavender essential oil in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a burn, just put it on neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover it with an ice cube, and the pain
will be gone in a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's almost no chance it will
blister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is a powerful anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now had documentation from my
colleagues Dustin Sulak and Bonnie
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldstein of presence of a small amount of
Linolol, and Given Chimavar producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: key difference in the ability to control
seizures in children taking cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: its treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move on to the sesquiturbinoids,
and we're only going to discuss one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 15 carbon molecules,
a little bit higher molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foremost among these is karyophylline,
which is often the predominant remaining
[SPEAKER_00]: turbinoid in extracts, which tend to burn
off the monoturbinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's been known for a long time that
this is a very powerful anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: agent, but unlike all the non-steroidal
drugs out there that produce ulcers,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a gastroprotective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually prevents that kind of
involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only 10 years ago that it was
discovered that this is not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: turbinoid, but a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works selectively on that CB2 receptor,
the non-psychoactive receptor that
[SPEAKER_00]: mediates inflammation and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pharmacology realm, there are a
bunch of companies working on synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 agonists that would do the same thing,
but they've all failed, mainly due to
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern pharmacology usually rests around
identifying a receptor, using a computer
[SPEAKER_00]: to design a molecule that will lodge there
with the highest affinity and highest
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work on it for seven years,
spend $600 million and find out that it
[SPEAKER_00]: causes aplastic anemia or liver failure or
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, plants have been medicine for
almost all of our history, just 100 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've decided in our hubris that we
could do it better than nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we've been wrong for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also appears to be an agent that
could fight addictions to other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from animal work with synthetics
that rats who are trained to be addicted
[SPEAKER_00]: to cocaine will stop pressing a lever
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're exposed to CB2 agonists,
we could do the same thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: karyophylline, dirt sheet, and with no
risk of those toxicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move on to what I like to call the
cannabis odds and ends, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for that, because the tops and
bottoms are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of fine print here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friedelin is a triturbinoid, a 30-carbon
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: None in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very powerful anti-inflammatory
agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not one that's going to be prone to
all the side effects in the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-steroidals, and it's shown benefit
against a number of cancer cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly intriguing,
although the roots don't make a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it must be working, because any
number of people, particularly Natasha
[SPEAKER_00]: Riz, who's going to be speaking to you
later, that are using this in artisanal
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations to great advantage to treat
skin inflammation and other disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can be taken internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really intriguing to me,
because as it is, we're throwing this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a neglected herbal resource of
possibly great value here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, there's an agent we probably
haven't heard of called canaprine,
[SPEAKER_00]: another potential anti-inflammatory agent
that is in a fair concentration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you taking pictures,
all of this is going to come out in that
[SPEAKER_00]: article that will be published in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to contact me then,
we'll get you the key information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should forget the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly we're dealing with sinsemir ganja,
the unfertilized female flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when allowed to fertilize itself,
it makes this wonderful seed, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the most complete single food on
earth, in that it has a digestible
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, indestin, and perfect balance of
omega-3 and omega-6, essential fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to pick one food upon which to
survive, this would be a good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, when you sprout it,
other things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canflavin is what's called a flavon,
an anti-inflammatory chemical that was
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered about 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to be developed as a drug
because canflavin A is too hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate from canflavin B, so to purify
it's too difficult, which is good for us
[SPEAKER_00]: because it raises the possibility that it
could be used as an herbal agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been discovered that when you sprout
this, you increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: canflavin, and if you have the right
chemover cannabis, it's not yet producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, so it might be legal in a
number of jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very promising agent for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not affecting COX-1 or COX-2 with
all their side effects to produce ulcers,
[SPEAKER_00]: strokes, and heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To finish up, I want to give you some
examples using the fight of facts and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a type 1 plant, THC
predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mostly what is available out there
in the realm of cannabis commerce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one's called type 1 pining,
and the reason is you see the big green
[SPEAKER_00]: bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an agent very rich in THC,
but yet low in mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low sedation, high in pining, not having
that short-term memory impairment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so if you need a THC to treat your
muscles, spasticities, spasms,
[SPEAKER_00]: or pain, good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 2 plants have roughly equal amounts
of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way cannabis used to be before
selective breeding for the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: market made it all type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this one's high in limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of CBD, which is good for
inflammation and burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD is good for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also high in linalool, which is the
sort of violet bar down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So burns and epilepsy, what do they have
in common?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's the need for this type 2
legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 3 plants are high CBD and low in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, because it's very high in
cariophylline and has CBD predominantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be very good for pain, inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being high in cariophylline, it's also
good to treat addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are things that seem very
disparate, but have in common the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: these various components.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another type 3 CBD predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's very high in limonene and
low in sedative aspects, it should be very
[SPEAKER_00]: good for treating depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a fair amount of limonool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type 3, this one I'm really
excited about, because it's not only rich
[SPEAKER_00]: in CBD, it's got a good amount of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should work on generalized seizures
and seizures of partial onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cariophylline will provide reduction
of inflammation, and the limonool will
[SPEAKER_00]: also contribute to it being
anticonvulsant, what we call a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should work in most of the many kinds
of seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I wanted to show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going left to right, we have a type 1
plant, high THC, type 2 in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: equal amounts of THC and CBD, and type 3
predominantly CBD on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the turbinoid bars at the
bottom, they look the same in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the ability to compare these in
patients really tells a great deal about
[SPEAKER_00]: what the contributions are of the
different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping one side the same,
and we're altering the balance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very promising for future
clinical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I haven't exceeded my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's your break time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to leave for any reason,
please do so with no hard feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
