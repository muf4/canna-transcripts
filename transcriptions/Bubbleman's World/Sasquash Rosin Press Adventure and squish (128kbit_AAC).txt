[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, welcome to Bubble Man's world,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Dom from Sunrise Wellness Foundation
there, I got Matt and Victoria from
[SPEAKER_08]: Sasquatch, Ros & Press, Max hiding out of
the frame, there he is, also from Sunrise,
[SPEAKER_08]: and me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're heading out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna head over to Bowen,
we're gonna do some dabs out on the boat,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe get ourselves a nice little meal,
and then hopefully come back and get our
[SPEAKER_08]: squish on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the plan.
[SPEAKER_13]: We pretty much just come down here from
springtime to fall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get the job done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just started cracking this year,
it's kind of bumming me out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it is what it is, gotta do some
fixing uping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel free to jump on the vessel there,
crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone has room, everyone has room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we all got room, we're on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope we can head over to Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just start the boat, not even untie
it, just give her right off the dock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty crazy, be weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more buddy making it, making it on the
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah dude, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah man, welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's good stuff that can fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just so beautiful out here,
it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't want to get that in the old prop,
even though it's just a stick,
[SPEAKER_08]: you just never know how much it can affect
you in such a short time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where
[SPEAKER_08]: do you go on Bowen?
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to this breakfast place, I don't even
know the name of it, it's just straight
[SPEAKER_08]: down the road on the left, a little past.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like Bowen directions.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's yummy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Down the road on the left.
[SPEAKER_17]: We just started jawing with chalk on the
concrete, literally the dopest shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: The dopest shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so high right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone that said they couldn't jaw drew
the dopest shit dude, it was insane as
[SPEAKER_17]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like way sick, I wish my phone was alive.
So sweet.
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright now flip it.
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You flip yours first man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flip it for the camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flip it with the drop down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flip in exchange, flip in exchange.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little seal swimming,
a little baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably waiting for it's mama while she's
feeding on the eye.
Baby
seal.
[SPEAKER_18]: He gives classes now too, it's pretty
awesome, you can go there and he's a major
[SPEAKER_18]: tripper man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Half these glass blowers man.
[SPEAKER_14]: His mother is Terry Glass, she's like an
old school glass blower and he started
[SPEAKER_14]: when he was 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Tom waking.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just telling stories about Sewell's
Marina, you can rent the Sewell's boats
[SPEAKER_08]: out here and a lot of people do and quite
a few of them they like to drive really
[SPEAKER_08]: close by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really close by, like those boats were
within 20 or 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going like 10 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems reasonable.
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you give him?
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave him the where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, these were the guys that I
pictured cause I'm like dude you should
[SPEAKER_08]: come out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like oh it's not that easy,
you can't just enter a new market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like dude, you won't have a problem
entering a new market with what you have,
[SPEAKER_08]: I can promise you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was thinking of you two guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you guys are meeting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh it's fire dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh what do you got there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it in the sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, looks good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hard to do on a boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Focus in on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy's all far away, he's like let's
pull in so we can get closer to that boat
[SPEAKER_07]: when we drive by.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get it in the sun.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the one I would uh.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweet blue?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I wanna try this one too.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll try them all, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna give this to you Matt,
then you can just pour it in because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: more of a pouring style.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting this boat party started.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Platinum Girl Scout Cookies cross
Y5-43.
[SPEAKER_09]: Platinum Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean it's a hazy, unusual haze type
strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like super lemon hazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but it didn't stay fluffy,
it's got hard nuggets.
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't stretch, it really looks nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like it's got stopper in it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of shit that makes you lose your
bike.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah man, I brought our film material on,
went through security, then they pulled me
[SPEAKER_14]: over.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were like, well we have to go to
procedure, we have to call the police.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the police took half an hour to get
there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And once they got there, they have to
verify Canada.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they verified me with Canada.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, alright, well I'm good,
I can walk out.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're like, oh no wait, we have to
now verify WestJet.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, she fucking waited another 15
minutes for them to show up and then
[SPEAKER_14]: WestJet's like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean like, can we take off?
[SPEAKER_18]: She just looked at the cop like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The waves have
[SPEAKER_05]: gotten a little crazier than we were
expecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have known when the blue sky
showed its face that the waves would start
[SPEAKER_05]: being affected by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And indeed they are and have been.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are banging the fuck around in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This shit is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on the ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ocean!
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so hard to film.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool, that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: One million.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I can't believe it's even windy in
here right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is trippy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there's a smaller one than those
two.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like tugboats and oranges.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking massive ass fairies.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's room, it's always dicey.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dicey, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And already it's not looking good,
I'll just say that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your other option?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's the Sewell's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I just go put my boat there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to get some movies out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We might have to float here for a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see some guy going to his boat right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the end, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be our spot, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could be literally hanging out with us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the guy leaving?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the vibes that he's leaving.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he just stay here?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like he just got here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at how hard the blowing is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll blow us into these boats fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to get into the area here.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's got his truck there.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to go park it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the car boats.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to establish ourself as the next
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here comes another guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could be in this piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to postpone Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the ferry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've headed over to Horseshoe Bay now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here safe and sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just waiting for a boat to leave
the dock so we can have a parking spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess we'll see what happens here
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I get the most likes when I film
people's butts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, Matt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clench up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is Horseshoe Bay, guys,
where you catch the ferry to Bowen Island,
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we ended up here in
Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to head over to the All of an
Anchor and get some food.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then head back out into the gusty,
windy ocean experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's trying to film us.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's already a finger in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we've got the flatbread,
the calamari, the emby mail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis culture bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have gone to Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put this in the trash where it
belongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine those guys trying to have their
party on the boat.
[SPEAKER_17]: That flamingo would be just mashed.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I guess let's take the other
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get some rigs out, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to get dab in that bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to hit a bike.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's underneath the seat here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Under this one?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt, can I just get up for a minute?
[SPEAKER_18]: He's like, not really.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I don't really want to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather sit here if I could.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's doable.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're low on Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're doing pretty well with them so
far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've got four.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've reused them many, many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I run out and I don't want to bind
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reuse, reuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good little tripod.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it got into position fast anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little banging when the wave hits
the boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does this little sort of like dunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what am I hitting?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is your bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys know where your bike is?
[SPEAKER_08]: My bike's right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look at the color on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost looks like some weird orange CO2
oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But because it isn't, I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that weird?
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it have that burnt smell,
flavor to it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not a big fan of that particular
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's someone out there doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting better.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting better, but it still has that
little.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's people partying all around us
right now, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like sure to attract a police
boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Parked right next to the party.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least they'll go there first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in this fucked up world that we live
in, they'll be fine, all abusing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get harassed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not even going to be patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty much ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want your bike?
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that someone's slogan?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck that's delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's been a while since I actually
did a video for Bubble Man's World that
[SPEAKER_08]: wasn't just a live video with people,
friends, puffing bowls, having a nice day.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is good vibes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys want to go drive in the big
waves?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go drive real fast in the big waves?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the chaos of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the chill vibes of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'd just prefer to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too many waves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I wonder if I should move the boat
before we smack the rocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's get in here.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not as money.
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, we have to leave this upside down?
[SPEAKER_08]: You de-moneyed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's the other side.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get it in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it shows us what we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, of course.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like you're dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can put it almost right next to the
lens.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just want to get the sun in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, do you have that cover cut?
[SPEAKER_14]: That side has a cleaner on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it comes out.
[SPEAKER_12]: These guys got a full boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so after many dabs,
the situation up front is dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Situation out back, lounged out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't look as loungy as you could
look, Neil.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm going to have to take my shoes
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Max and Dom seem like they have a PhD in
lounging right now, and you seem like you
[SPEAKER_08]: just maybe got your Bachelor of Science.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think I'm going to have to take my
shoes off.
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put your feet up on Dom's leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it work.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, this is a boat I have
never, ever seen in the Howe Sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen it in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 20 years of living on the Howe Sound,
I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's trucking, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a turbo engine near spooling.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: This house is super pimp.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one on the corner here.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how it goes in the back there,
too?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very big house.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it was first, first built,
almost before it was lit, then it came to
[SPEAKER_06]: movie with Harrison Ford there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at all the chairs on this lawn.
Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got it pimped out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should pull up to the dog in the loo,
dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put in groceries.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a serious house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Servers.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're heading back on water.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fooded up, dabbed up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's time to squish.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, a jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't really see him.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're getting busy with it.
Crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that whole thing apart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting some wiring done here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just about done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just need that one last tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a triple Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those guys just left, too, to go downtown.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this right here is what I call customer
service.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys jumped on a plane.
[SPEAKER_08]: They came down, and they are changing my
plates and my electrical.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are the top notch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all you have to do is call them,
and they'll fly right to your house.
[SPEAKER_15]: Depending on who you are.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'm going to fuck them down and really
do it for anybody, really.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you are, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even when you said that, it didn't sound
like you at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not how it was probably heard by the
audience.
[SPEAKER_10]: These look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: These got a little bit scratched.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you pull those out of the plate again,
just to show them?
[SPEAKER_08]: These are made in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wooddale.
[SPEAKER_14]: The heaters.
[SPEAKER_14]: Illustrated heating element.
[SPEAKER_17]: No Chinese heating elements either.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thermocobal wires.
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, can you give me like a marker to
maybe label top from bottom?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like green or orange?
[SPEAKER_15]: Green.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely the
[SPEAKER_17]: easiest way to go about this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Do them while they're not installed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can just imagine fitting those
rods and getting them nice and crooked,
[SPEAKER_18]: and then they don't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my rods are all crooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what did you do exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was bending them, but I don't think that
bent them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so you want to make it so they can replace
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting it in there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's hooked up just fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, looks good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's heating up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got the new PIDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you want to tell me anything about
this particular little upgrade that you
[SPEAKER_08]: want people to know about?
[SPEAKER_17]: The Omega PIDs.
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, these things fucking work super,
super well.
[SPEAKER_17]: They get to temp, state of temp.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other ones kind of fluctuate 5 to 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_17]: These ones literally will fluctuate like
0.1, 0.2.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, pretty ridiculous how accurate they
are.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the thermocouple wires,
like I was showing you just now,
[SPEAKER_17]: upgraded all that shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: See the differences there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we went from this crazy bird nest
looking shit to this.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is real nice right here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, gives it that flexibility.
[SPEAKER_17]: Without any chance of breaking the wires
inside the metal.
[SPEAKER_17]: This thing having super no flexibility.
Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: And obviously, the bubble man's world
plates.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there always an option?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's like $250.
[SPEAKER_17]: Custom anything you guys have.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have a vector file, it's the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sweet, well, let's get squishing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We gave you a new box, but we did.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_17]: We went from the handcrafted wooden box to
a Washington-made plastic box.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll accept it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going red hot until it reaches temp,
and then it'll stop and cool off.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: But with the other ones, it takes longer
to heat up, but it's a lot more accurate
[SPEAKER_17]: of a heat.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, this yard is badass.
[SPEAKER_08]: You like bubble man's world?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's crazy how steep it is, and it just
has all the badass tears.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Super sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys own this place, though?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Super quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like three, four minutes?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes three or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't believe how fast that was.
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's super, super cold outside,
I would imagine maybe giving it an extra
[SPEAKER_17]: minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the parchment that I had in
there as well?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need some filming?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is this here?
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe this was this, no?
[SPEAKER_14]: That is Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_14]: And tell us about the Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a MedMan Genetic, phenotype number
two.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got a little purple in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very gassy, fuely.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to try squishing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Super gas, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be the first thing to get
squished in the M1.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a little too dry for what you're
used to?
[SPEAKER_17]: A little bit more moist is the best,
but this is honestly like you don't want
[SPEAKER_17]: to go any drier than this.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think the moisture content is
on that right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe like 5%.
[SPEAKER_17]: 5% to 8% or something?
6%.
[SPEAKER_17]: Somewhere right there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably comfortable.
[SPEAKER_17]: When packing bags, I always get the
corners with flour.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I guess anything you're working,
just make sure to pack your corners up
[SPEAKER_17]: super well so that you don't waste any to
your fabric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that's a very good tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also use this tip.
[SPEAKER_17]: Try not to create any air pockets also in
your bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywhere oil can find its way and sit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Try to just really make it as tight as
possible and as even as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Little bit of nugget going in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Better to have something to hold this shit
open.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I usually use a business card.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're actually designing bag openers right
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be like a little metal slide
that will hold open any size bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like a little sled, I guess.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just try to break up the weed a little bit
just to avoid any voids.
[SPEAKER_17]: What would you say this was?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like 5 grams?
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe 4 grams?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, about 4 grams.
[SPEAKER_17]: Smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it smells insane.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is honestly the biggest pain in the
ass about rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Preparing the bag and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's definitely not hitting the foot
pedal.
[SPEAKER_17]: That could become annoying.
[SPEAKER_17]: This weed is definitely super oily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sticking the bag to... Yeah,
it's already sticking.
[SPEAKER_17]: For it being as dry as it is, it's still
super oily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit guys, shut it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, we're not living in that world
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is federally licensed property.
[SPEAKER_08]: To possess, to grow, and to process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this part of the equation is the
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing the processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very valid information.
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to know it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The M1 is in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like that little guy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we really tried to steer clear from
looking like anything else out there.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we really wanted our own design
again after, you know, kind of being...
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to say copied, but imitated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just jacked completely.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we wanted to... We wanted to try
to separate ourselves again.
[SPEAKER_17]: The diamond look is definitely something
that fucking... Yeah, it looks a lot like
[SPEAKER_08]: my new unit that I have coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that what people love to do though,
hey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I got one just like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I take the dimensions real quick?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: New tech.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, no voids, nice and evenly packed.
[SPEAKER_17]: No voids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Corners packed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You spent the extra time and that's
definitely all it takes right there is
[SPEAKER_08]: don't rush packing your bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice and even.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice and even.
[SPEAKER_08]: You usually want to wear gloves,
but... Right, and we're just hand pumping
[SPEAKER_08]: this thing today, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very small piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canadian parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got that Canadian parchment paper?
[SPEAKER_08]: We call it par-shmall.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Canada, we call it par-shmall.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it not a little thing?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's on the other side.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have little things here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Canadian showing them how it's
done right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canadian parchment.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I just rip them brutal
every time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to rip it and it does this huge,
leaves that big extra piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, all right, I'll go get the
scissors.
[SPEAKER_17]: Too big, okay, let's go get scissors.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's good, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_17]: So if someone's trying to even press hash
or do larger amounts of flour,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's always good to fold in the sides like
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is basically a directional flow
burrito tech.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or whatever the hell we used to call it in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_17]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Burrito tech?
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go with the burrito tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds really familiar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get that burrito tech going,
bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then SobbinglessMind's like,
the fuck you doing making your burrito so
[SPEAKER_17]: small?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Put the burrito all the way across.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking retards.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good to have magnets,
too, which we don't have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, I just did the fucking...
[SPEAKER_08]: Look up at the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really touch that thing at all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, here, move your hand.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get in there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just get the plates open enough.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Get those magnets open.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Couple of magnetos.
[SPEAKER_17]: Always want to center your shit out as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other pump, bro, is like six pumps to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've already pumped it like 12 times,
you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to preheat just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of squish the material about halfway
and allowing everything to become viscous.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go from a solid to a liquid.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll apply pressure.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm only at 200 degrees, so this might be
a longer press.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, considering my son's losing his shit
off camera, I bet you it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: very long press.
[SPEAKER_17]: 200 degrees usually, I mean, it could take
upwards to even three minutes to press
[SPEAKER_17]: something.
[SPEAKER_17]: People go down to even like 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_17]: 180 degrees, which I believe is just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes way too long.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, hell, yeah, it tastes fucking epic.
[SPEAKER_17]: It tastes epic for sure and will be really
bomb.
[SPEAKER_17]: But a lot of times you're losing a few
percent on your yields and a lot of time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what this does at 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a tiny little piece coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little drippy drips on the other side
there now, too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we have flipped it on its front?
[SPEAKER_17]: Helped with gravity a little.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you can just tell this one's so much
jankier than the other.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to swap it out right now on this
next press.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that one a single stage?
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that one a single stage?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's a single stage Esco.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to go up to like 220.
[SPEAKER_17]: I totally forgot we were even at 200.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I started going down like,
oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's going to be something.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like doing pre-pushes, like a low temp
one and a higher temp one, just to get
everything out.
[SPEAKER_17]: You get that first one that's just so
tasty.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's head stash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's worth it if you're doing it for
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some butter.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they're already cheesed out already.
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole thing's buttered out.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can definitely repress that at like
220, 225 even.
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely produce a lot more out of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But that is going to be some really tasty
for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is lovely, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take this thing into the bush and go
press in the bush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want to press in the bush,
you ask?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of plants in the bush.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so what's the best thing to do?
[SPEAKER_17]: This fitting here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I did wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it takes even geniuses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I close this without pushing that in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put that all the way closed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold it there and seal it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I did that the wrong way and then
Neil ended up pressurizing it a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit, it had pressure the one way but not
the other way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pressure will go in but won't come out and
your plates will get stuck down.
[SPEAKER_17]: Always test your plates before pressing
because I've had people call and be like,
[SPEAKER_17]: do you have a whole ounce stuck in the
press?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like what do I do?
[SPEAKER_17]: And they gave it full pressure.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's where you need to get a wrench to
actually get it to turn and open.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like right now we just barely did it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was gloves and it was super easy.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, always make sure that that
connection is good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the other hand pump.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you have a dab, bro,
of your resin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Check this out, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like six pumps.
[SPEAKER_17]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the way down.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was proper so he's hitting this
resin.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other one was like 18 pumps.
[SPEAKER_08]: God, does that smell fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 pumps versus six.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called a dual stage.
[SPEAKER_17]: It flows twice as much oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: The powder coating is so fucking clean on
these things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he must have heard me turn the camera
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got like super senses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, he's like, I think my dad's
filming.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think my dad's filming.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the resin temperature.
[SPEAKER_17]: What else do we got to press?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: The bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven gram bike right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see what it's going to...
Let's see what this tastes like.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you do?
[SPEAKER_17]: This thing's hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just took a rip and I didn't leave it
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I used it and it gets hot as hell when
you use it too.
[SPEAKER_17]: These are all burns from blowing glass,
dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_17]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_17]: Learning not to burn myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you breaking up here?
[SPEAKER_14]: Some head banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, more head banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like for how long I've been doing this
shit, I should fucking... Okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: 5.6.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should have the tank down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that tells us it's an eight gram press.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't even weigh that before you
straight packed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Eight gram press.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we'll know where we stand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the headband again,
or the head... Oh, this is the where's my
[SPEAKER_14]: bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one I'm really excited about.
[SPEAKER_17]: This one's more of a... This is the
headband.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 4.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, it looks almost the same size.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a lot thinner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_17]: More resinous also as the where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my bike's got the major... We're
gonna see a good squish off of eight
[SPEAKER_08]: grams, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_08]: We shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it right, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Men and women.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you
[SPEAKER_18]: want me to collect that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like the best thing I could do is
just sit on my ass and film all of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what you got over there with that
pump thing there, thingamajiggy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that was the pump really nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't you close it already with a half
a pump?
[SPEAKER_17]: Three little quick ass pumps and you're
ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's good to see like little mistakes
and recoveries and sort of... I like to
[SPEAKER_17]: put the flap upward so it's easier to
grab.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you don't slide your bag across your
freshly made rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's talking about that little... There
we go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Little half squish.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pre-squish.
[SPEAKER_17]: Depending on what temperature you're at,
your pre-squish is gonna be between like
[SPEAKER_17]: five to ten seconds, not really much.
[SPEAKER_17]: I always just did it intuitively.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes, a lot of times too,
people don't do a preheat.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not always recommended with certain
strains.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some strains just wanna fucking start
dumping instantly.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a preheat's not really necessary.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like this bike?
[SPEAKER_17]: A preheat might darken your product with
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's no...
[SPEAKER_17]: We should've actually got you a... A
gauge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Neil was asking about a pressure
gauge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I'm blocking the way there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking really nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really nice quality.
[SPEAKER_17]: You said this is a month old too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or like months cured?
[SPEAKER_16]: Three months?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you said three months.
[SPEAKER_16]: Beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's flowing, I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's flowing out of that far right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely well taken care of,
dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_16]: That is so pretty.
[SPEAKER_18]: You try to get most of it out on the first
squish as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: 90%.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of times, nothing comes out on the
second press.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't do second presses just because
there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_17]: You use it for something else.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I give them to people who make
edibles.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, some people will make coconut
capsules.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just whatever, cook them down with some
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just make some capsules.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, really nice quality.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's the smell, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see that purple coming out in the
corner right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good lord, is that nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, Neil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I want to get my macro lens out
and shoot this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's such a nice color.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so people are aware here.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to see this, you can see the
corners of the bag.
[SPEAKER_17]: When the weed was packed in here,
it wasn't squared out.
[SPEAKER_17]: So these corners after the fold,
when you make the fold, it got some oil
[SPEAKER_17]: trapped.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you want to do is try to square
out everything as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: Make it nice and square, not have any kind
of rounded edges.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that when you fold it over,
it has no voids in the corners.
[SPEAKER_17]: Try to make sure those corners are packed
up as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the second or third?
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the first at 220 with the head
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: The head banger, right.
[SPEAKER_17]: We pressed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out a little light.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we haven't actually wrapped these up
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should gather all this once I've
photographed it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, big time.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's producing already more.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's less of an amount that
we're pressing this time.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have another one there.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, I can start collecting.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have to deal with something quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go deal with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, it's upwards of 20%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll get this one, and we'll be able
to calculate both.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can speed that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you can just wait and see what it
is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it super?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's sappy a little, that one,
eh?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be super nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: See that little pocket?
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_14]: So just like fill them up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I hadn't finished the top there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my phone call.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is such nice resin, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's a whole thing about resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: The nicer it peels up, the way this is so
stable, the way it smells, the way I
[SPEAKER_08]: already know it hits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was eight grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is it ever a nice color, dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nice, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: God, that cleaned off the parchment.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like the parchment isn't sticky.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the scale under here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pass me the scale there.
[SPEAKER_08]: God, this resin is nice, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is really, really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Squish, squash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, a lot of times you got to put your
hand, like, make a background for it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a weird little, it's just a
piece of resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so let's see what this is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That ended up being 2.3 off of eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_08]: 25% would be two, so it's 2.3.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 28%, 29% or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn near 30% yield on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we didn't pack the bag correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a chunk of fucking rosin,
bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: How much you want for a minute?
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the other one here?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's nice, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_18]: We should check with our yielders on that
one as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: What was the, was it four grams?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I really, this is really annoying.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sideways angle of the.
[SPEAKER_15]: More than five times they've fucking done
this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you'll be able to let them know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Six times now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can let them know, dude,
I was at the customer's place.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to switch companies, dude,
because you guys are going to piss in the
coffee room.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or just make your own.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like, dude, they make really nice
products, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And they do take care of us.
0.8.
[SPEAKER_17]: 0.8.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll order five of something.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we would have had like maybe a
scale that's a little bit on the point,
[SPEAKER_18]: the double digits, there would probably
have a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be, could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just move to 0.7 as you said that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.8, it's back to 0.8, it's back to 0.8.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're good, we're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did we say, 4.5?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, just on the back here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, she produced.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, even at, you can probably have
pressed it lower.
[SPEAKER_17]: This, well, I usually press a like 210.
[SPEAKER_17]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I usually press it at 210 and she
just oozes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting the Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ver is my bicycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's waiting to exhale it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oopsie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peanut brittle.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we have decided that that's
enough pressing of rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a good day though, hasn't it,
team of rosin pressers?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're going to head to the Salmon
House on the hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt I'm going to bring the camera
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I do, you'll be lucky because it is my
favorite restaurant in all of BC and maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: West Coast cuisine, salmon like fired off
in the like Alder grilled.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess we'll see you later,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.
See you later.
