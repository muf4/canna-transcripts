[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with my sound?
[SPEAKER_07]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of technical difficulty
today, but we made it work, didn't we,
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear you beautifully, my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having trouble with my Logitech
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back to my FaceTime camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, when I downloaded
everything back to my computer,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, still some technical issues,
but good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, good morning, good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me make sure I sent off the link to
the Hash Church aficionados in the other
[SPEAKER_07]: room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, but it's only really been seen by
you so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, nice to have you back, my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: We missed you last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had a computer crash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a corrupt file vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, my computer completely locked
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I turned it on, it would just
go black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to wipe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my wipe, my reinstall was
corrupted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to literally go everything all
over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, you know, a total fun time
suck, as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one here watching has ever had any
problems with computers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week, sir?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, very busy, very busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just still trying to make sure that
all these invitations get out to the right
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know, well, we had, I talked to
Brian from Vital Garden Supplies.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he was going to make it in today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to make sure he's got the link.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also talked to Wade, Wade Lafter there
from, yeah, so also hoping that he's going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be making it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also talked to Peter from Soil
Balance Pro.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he also said he was going to be making
it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So between those three guys right there,
we could have a nice little conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: about bacteria and soil and greenhouses
and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our people down in Chalice
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bearing the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 and I thought 109, 110.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But much love to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was interesting to see with
their, they did testing everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: they had quite a few fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really post them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just said they had fails.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw, I saw a little bit of fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised that still so many high
numbers of failures in these competitions,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, you know, it's part of the reality
of people not realizing what and where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting their product from that
they're making their hash or people just
[SPEAKER_02]: outright lying, you know, which is either
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy to know you're going to get
your material tested and just be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just spray a little Avid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, they're not going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, welcome Wade and welcome Brian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you both.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys both came in almost
instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the big smiling face, Wade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling very good this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of exciting things going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, House of Harlequin representing and,
uh, Brian representing vital garden
[SPEAKER_07]: supplies, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for showing up, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really an honor for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know how your invitation came
out?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's one of the coolest stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, I've been doing these
giveaways on my channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do a wake and bake every morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not hash turds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of wake and bake and shoot the
shit with the audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes we get pretty deep and we
cover some pretty awesome things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I, people start sending me stuff
all the time and I don't need this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too much stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've decided I'm passing it all like
all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to pass all of it out and
send it to the people who appreciate it
[SPEAKER_07]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've been doing these giveaways and
then I started doing contests.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course people were like,
Oh, I answered that before he did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, here's the screenshot from my
screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won the contest, not him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I turned the contest into a not
contest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned it into random giveaways.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people would say to me, Hey,
did I miss the giveaway?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd say, no, actually you won the
giveaway today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me your address.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did that the other day to this
kid named Eric and lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's a good friend of Brian's and he sends
me an email and he says, dude,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for hooking me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was such, such a neat way to win
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, if you ever want to have
Brian on from vital garden supply,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, of course I've been talking
about that with Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't have the connection.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, well, let me connect you
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how Brian came to be on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes me even feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric's a good old friend for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that he feels that highly of me to
recommend it is even more of an honor.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent a great email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, literally he was like,
it was one sentence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave him a bottle of DC glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cleaner or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like 10 paragraphs of how awesome
Brian from vital garden supply is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, those are the people we want
on hash church for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I said, it's an honor and I'm
stoked to be on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I see ATN's on and I don't
know if you remember, but way back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, ATN used to hang out at my nightclub
called Nyabingi Dance Hall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I used to have the club next door
called the dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, it was the machine shop.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a hat on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't recognize you.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo hippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that goes back to Morgantown,
West Virginia, back in the early nineties
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a place called the underground
railroad, which was basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you ever look on the old black flag
album, who's got the 10 and a half at 10
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half inches is Morgantown,
West Virginia, because Marsha who used to
[SPEAKER_02]: run the old underground railroad used to
hook all the artists up when they would
[SPEAKER_02]: come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she paid them, you know,
back in the early, late eighties,
[SPEAKER_02]: early nineties, nobody was paying for
shit, but she paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people came and
unfortunately she disappeared due to
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever actually happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bad coke deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know, but she's never been
found, but the underground railroad sat
[SPEAKER_02]: quiet, quite dormant for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys came in and picked up
the reins and really, really restarted the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire there in Morgantown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for kicking in the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think James is still carrying on the
tradition as a one, two, three Pleasant
[SPEAKER_01]: Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tradition continues and yeah,
they ended up buying up the machine shop
[SPEAKER_02]: and made that now part of the one,
two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's a rather large venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty large as it was before when
you guys had it, but yeah, good to see you
[SPEAKER_02]: still doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely been like seeing all the
success that you've had and all the cool
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you're doing and just,
you know, worlds collide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are now in California and you
know, you're providing the good,
[SPEAKER_02]: the good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause as we know, good grow information
was hard to find, especially back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, you know, I told people I used to
have to go to when I first started growing
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the late eighties there in West
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go to Ohio to actually buy my
grow equipment out of fear because one,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to go to Columbus and we even parked
like two or three blocks away out of fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's how heavy the green
merchant fear was back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would, yeah, I remember my
friend, Nathan and I, we had to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hide and look around as we were
trying to act, we had to look all paranoid
[SPEAKER_02]: walking out of there with just a little
400 water that we ended up putting in a
[SPEAKER_02]: closet and growing through the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it was, yeah, the heavy fear
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you couldn't ask anybody for
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the best you could come up with
was tomatoes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and even since then,
you know, depending on who you talk to,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd look at you funny about your
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how big are your tomatoes and where are
they in season?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, oh man, they just,
there was brutal questions, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody remember this, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, do we ever, you know, I didn't
grow up in West Virginia, but Winnipeg,
[SPEAKER_07]: Manitoba was definitely in the Bible belt.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was definitely harsh.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can imagine when I was 17 years
old, I went to the local hydroponics store
[SPEAKER_07]: and I met my mentor, Ron Hickey.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this guy, he's talking to a 17 year
old, first of all, imagine this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he takes me down to his basement and
he says, look, you, you and I both know
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not talking about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't we just talk about what we're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he just was basically like from that
every single day forward that I knew him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He paid the price with 11 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of his freedom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he never stopped giving away all the
information in the way that it should be
[SPEAKER_07]: given away.
[SPEAKER_07]: He even put 2000 watt light bulbs in the
front window of his hydroponics store that
[SPEAKER_07]: he opened after he got out the first time,
showing everyone how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cops actually made him turn those
lights off because they were so bright out
[SPEAKER_07]: on the main front street that it was
causing problems with traffic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to all the mentors,
all the, all the giants that we've been
[SPEAKER_07]: able to stand on the shoulders of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for sure it's been a bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those low key people in those
hydroponics stores that knew who we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, but didn't say shit,
but gave us the information we needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, first crop I ever grew back there
in Morgantown, West Virginia was 1988.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just been learning and trying to gain
knowledge ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, keep it clean and organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross, Ross Johnny was the first person
that turned me on to kind of in West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never forget that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was one of those things where
back then, you gotta understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really ignorant about cannabis
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was slinging Max and I had a little
bit of Max and we were in the back of my
[SPEAKER_02]: club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you want to smoke a bowl?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pull out a pipe and he's like,
no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulls out this little green thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh, this is weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, no, that ain't weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to need more than that to get
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, just all embarrassing,
you know, and green as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I hit that weed and it changed my
life forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, Johnny, he's like,
I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get you any weed, but you know,
this shit's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you should try growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weed, you know, it's like,
so mega thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be weed without what you guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was thinking of maybe asking Brian to
kind of introduce himself to the Hash
[SPEAKER_07]: Church group here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let everyone know what Vital Garden
Supplies is up to and what they're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: and sort of the groups that you guys are
working for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know who you are and I know what
you're up to, but maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: audience doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Vital Garden Supplies, a purveyor of
high quality organic farming garden
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cater to the cannabis industry
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going on our 11th or 12th
season now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year we try to gain more and more
high end products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under our own label.
[SPEAKER_01]: We search high and far throughout the
world to get the best that we can to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: it to people so they could have clean,
successful gardens without the nasty stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of people are pushing at those
same hydro stores that we started going to
[SPEAKER_01]: way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have evolved and learned how
to teach people about the organic side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and some haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've taken it upon myself to make sure
that our products are as accessible as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible for people for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be always the smaller group
choosing the more righteous, higher
[SPEAKER_07]: integrity process, you know, like to not
grow with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems like less people grow
organically than not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you kind of agree with that or do
you see a lot of people picking up the
[SPEAKER_07]: organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see a shift for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one good thing about all of,
one of many good things about all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and things coming above
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be some, you know,
testing and some, you know, regiments that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to have to get rid of
that they used to use to get rid of things
[SPEAKER_01]: such as powdery mildew and mice and things
like that where now they're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to use organic solutions so that their
product is sellable and considered
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and even actually now that we're
going to have rec, even like smokable
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like there's been a lot of hiding
behind closed doors all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be nice to see everybody,
you know, really have to like show the
[SPEAKER_01]: proof and the paperwork behind what they
produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you located, Brian?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Nevada City, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a distribution center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been into your store, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, one of the, one of the complaints
I have about a lot of growth stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go into them, they, the salespeople
seem most interested in selling products
[SPEAKER_00]: as versus informing and helping the person
that's standing in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my experience in your store has been
that your employees actually try to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate me on the various products that
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what implications that they'll have in
the final products that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you, you're, you're a sterling example
of how, in my opinion, a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: provider should be in terms of,
like I said, you're not really pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: products so much as trying to help educate
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really thing I think is a
huge need in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we definitely obviously,
you know, our business is to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: products, but we also really do appreciate
those farmers who take things upon
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and make their own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're self-sufficient and they're
building their own, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms in their flora and their
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, we have products if
they need aid in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as our industry is growing,
there's going to be many different paths
[SPEAKER_01]: that people choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I see it is, you know,
the people who are trying to go larger
[SPEAKER_01]: scale and want to stay organic,
they're going to have to source products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure that we're there
for them so they can actually source
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are safe and that are going to
actually have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't like it scared that,
oh, no, this organic thing isn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to go back to the
synthetic style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one thing vital has
been really good about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my employees especially are all super
passionate about growing cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_01]: all love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much and they've taken on this thing
that we've like inside, we call it vital
[SPEAKER_01]: pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I didn't even realize it
until several years into it that like some
[SPEAKER_01]: people really take it upon themselves to
really appreciate what it is that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: done and then then take that knowledge and
take that like specialization and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into their garden and put their little
twist on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it so that they're able to
have like the utmost success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're raising everybody up,
you know, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're passing out knowledge,
it's one of the things early on when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: a buyer there at BPG, I realized that I
could just send somebody away with their
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or I could actually, you know,
you can tell, you can look at a plant now
[SPEAKER_02]: or after you've looked at, you know,
tons of it as a lot of us have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can look at a bud and tell
exactly what's going on, what the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: issues are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would actually tell that to them
and mind would blow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always would say, okay, well,
here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be like, oh, my God,
were you in my garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, the bud is a truth teller.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you tell me, you're lying
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is telling me the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I look at the truth here,
you've got heat issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's picked too early, you know,
etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through the standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say you fail this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But next time, you know, come back to me
and let's see if you've applied these
[SPEAKER_02]: things and what you could have gotten this
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can deliver that, then I can
give you this price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people would go home with that
knowledge and apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, Brian, you know, people
really are searching or a thirsty for
[SPEAKER_02]: information because a lot of the earlier
grow books were so full of miss well,
[SPEAKER_02]: not misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically confusing to a lot of
people that people just wanted simple
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does my pH need to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what is my pH?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my, you know, what's the best
nutrients I need to grow, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's been a wonderful shift with,
you know, prohibition collapsing from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 215 to where you could start to
talk about it now with legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the fear anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you actually have suppliers
aren't worried that you're selling to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis people anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole paradigm is shift for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas back when, you know, back in the
day with green merch and everything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you had to act like an
undercover agent just going into a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a hydroponic store just to buy
your stuff, much less ask for information
[SPEAKER_02]: or get real information or information you
could actually use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Brian, for taking it and
raising the standards and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: raising everybody up together,
because that's why I still have suppliers
[SPEAKER_02]: at BPG is because, you know, 17,
18 years ago, we decided, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to educate these farmers so that
they can make better cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're reliant on our patient
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you the clone, but it's what
you do with that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know people can ruin a clone and
ruin every aspect of growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by putting good genetics out there,
we knew that good genetics would come back
[SPEAKER_02]: if people would get the good grow
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with that, it's born into good
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now everybody is benefiting from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the local regional, you know,
people are making more money, which means
[SPEAKER_02]: they can now spend more stuff at the
hydroponics or the grow stores so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can actually, you know, make bigger
and better crops for them themselves the
[SPEAKER_02]: next time so that sustainability and they
learn from that each time and that they we
[SPEAKER_02]: only help everybody get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for taking that philosophy,
because back 20 years ago, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we all were thirsting and craving for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that we like take
upon ourselves to like, be the first most
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowledge is power for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always sponsor different classes and
special people like Laneingham to like
[SPEAKER_01]: educate our clientele of how the right
thing to go about, you know, using
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes, organic fertilizer
and not feeling this thing that you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a synthetic or like scared to like get
away from their three part nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, education is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once people get comfortable with what
they're doing, it makes them enjoy what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing even better and feel a
little bit more, you know, confident in
[SPEAKER_01]: all aspects of gardening and farming and
growing cannabis and taking it to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's 20, 20 years ago,
plus it was vegetarian.
And that's where we're gonna take some
action.
I think, you know, people are more than
capable of improving their life.
Oh, that's awesome.
We want to borrow that.
It takes two seconds to learn.
We got time.
Let's select plant.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see how much we can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see how fast we can get it in
slowly, but surely think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's changed by people becoming more
focused on the actual medicinal components
[SPEAKER_07]: that are growing on these plants these
small little glandular trichomes whether
[SPEAKER_07]: capitate stocked or Cecil stocked or
bulbous all three of them contain the
[SPEAKER_07]: profiles that we seek and desire and As we
learn that we start growing a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: differently focused maybe more on the
actual medicinal components of the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: At least as much as the vegetative growth
and the and the vegetative plant matter
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're going to be yielding I gave up
on vegetative yields Maybe 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago now Hey, I'd like to welcome Indra to
the room and I'd like to welcome dr. Mark
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheldon to the room and we've got Peter
back from soil balance pro I thought he
[SPEAKER_07]: would make a wonderful addition to the
conversation along with Wade and along
[SPEAKER_07]: with Brian I'm not sure if you guys are
all familiar with one another but You're
[SPEAKER_07]: all kind of doing really wonderful shit in
different ways And you're all little
[SPEAKER_07]: pieces of the puzzle that I just see as
making a wonderful panel here today So
[SPEAKER_07]: welcome all of you to the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having yeah Nice to meet you
gentlemen Brian I'm gonna go back to you
[SPEAKER_02]: for a second What are the most common
problems that people are coming into you
[SPEAKER_02]: that are VEX that are looking for
solutions?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're big that you're able to find
or that are new solutions that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: found to assist people Good question there
ATN Back to what you were saying a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit earlier, too Like a year and a half
ago give or take I approached the maroon
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a couple organic bio pesticides
insectus not pesticides and fungicides and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all certified organic and made
from microbes and I had been using them
[SPEAKER_01]: for quite some time but unable to really
obtain them for distribution and They were
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely scared of the cannabis industry
and it took quite some arm-twists thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: get them to you know consider it and You
know, I really thank them for finally
[SPEAKER_01]: coming around and some of these products
are definitely helping by great great
[SPEAKER_01]: proportions on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the most common problems and
then broad mites and russet mites I'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: are like right behind the powdery mildew
as much as it as an issue and then
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium we're seeing a lot also and all
these products are all these issues have
[SPEAKER_01]: organic solutions which in the past a lot
of people didn't realize and anything from
[SPEAKER_01]: using a trichoderma which can kill all the
microbes that are in your root zone and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you obviously have to re-inoculate
the beneficials, but it will kill that
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium and Help your plant bounce back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't completely lose it the broad
mite thing We've definitely seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have infestations and with a couple
products like the grand Evo and the
[SPEAKER_01]: venerate the
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow That's kind of incredible when you
think about it because man every time I've
[SPEAKER_07]: ever seen those little things come into a
garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Okay, we need to set off a
nuclear bomb We're gonna be rebuilding in
[SPEAKER_02]: a different zone Yeah, well, that's the
reality right before you had those
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions if you want to do organically
basically if you had those type Situations
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just cut and start all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least there's at least it beneficial
solutions Now as opposed to the having to
[SPEAKER_02]: restart all over again altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the best the best solution is
trying to have a healthy Flora in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and have a healthy beneficial
microorganism population So your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are able to fight off anything that does
come their way But unfortunately with so
[SPEAKER_01]: much interaction and people trading plants
and people going to different gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: these pests are like innovative and they
figure out ways to get from one garden to
[SPEAKER_01]: another and Before you know it that that
garden that you are sure of was clean and
[SPEAKER_01]: pest-free Could have been contaminated by
One of the one of the biggest diseases
[SPEAKER_12]: that you're talking about is a powdery and
downy mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so a lot of people don't know this
but it's actually the scientific name for
[SPEAKER_12]: like Downy mildew is perinospora and so
what happens with perinospora is it
[SPEAKER_12]: actually It comes in the form of what's
called an OO spore.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys have heard of that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes Okay, so so these OO spores they're
like tiny little bowling balls,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if you think about where earthworms
come from, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Where do earthworms come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do they just kind of colonize the
soil?
[SPEAKER_12]: When they're not there before where do
earthworms come from in a healthy soil
[SPEAKER_12]: they come from from little eggs and that's
kind of how powdery and downy mildew come
[SPEAKER_12]: they they're in this little tiny OO spore,
which is like a bowling ball very very
[SPEAKER_12]: small very microscopic and these guys can
travel in from Different soil mediums
[SPEAKER_02]: anaerobic pockets somebody needs to quiet
their mic
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was injury injury you need to
work on your mic there buddy, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was me I was like what is
going on Continue on Peter continue on So
[SPEAKER_12]: think about like these little spores that
are in let's say an anaerobic pocket of
[SPEAKER_12]: undecomposed Compost right so you're
making your slow mixture and and these
[SPEAKER_12]: little spores are only going to Incubate
when obviously the temperature is perfect
[SPEAKER_12]: and the moisture is perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how you're gonna get The increase
in colonization within the soil aggregates
[SPEAKER_12]: That could actually gain competency And
then hit the root of the plant and then
[SPEAKER_12]: boom and it's gonna spread to maybe one
plant but as it as that perinospora
[SPEAKER_12]: Colonizes the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll jump it'll jump to other plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know the universities will come
out and tell you hey Molds and mildews are
[SPEAKER_12]: just they're in the air and it's an
environmental factor, you know You're
[SPEAKER_12]: gonna get it whether whether you want it
or not But what what what a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: scientists sustainable agriculture
scientists are finding is that?
[SPEAKER_12]: The these oh spores are in the oil in high
amounts and there's really nothing that
[SPEAKER_12]: Because again, there are these little like
bowling balls They're one of the hardest
[SPEAKER_12]: things even with like a fumigant like
methyl bromide or or a systemic fungicide
[SPEAKER_12]: these little spores are Super tough to
destroy it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're almost impossible to destroy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like Let's say Brian was saying the
only way to to kind of inhibit the
[SPEAKER_12]: colonization of powdery and downy mildew
which are two of the most Predominant
[SPEAKER_12]: diseases in your industry as well as like
you're sitting I think verticillium
[SPEAKER_12]: Fusarium rhizoctonia tritus and pythium
all all those guys are pretty big
[SPEAKER_12]: problems, too, but I don't know your
product but soluble humus concentrate if
[SPEAKER_12]: you can add humus which contains 100%
aerobic beneficial microorganisms you can
[SPEAKER_12]: get that diversity and and colonization Up
it's going to limit the impact or
[SPEAKER_12]: colonization Space on a microscopic level
that that that perinospora or powdery and
[SPEAKER_12]: downy mildew can actually Have in your
soil, but but but an important thing to
[SPEAKER_12]: know is that they are coming from the soil
Those those those microorganisms are
[SPEAKER_12]: developing in what you're bringing in your
soil medium So you just have to be really
[SPEAKER_12]: careful on what you guys are using today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I totally agree and I think a lot of
people are like due to like the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: emergence of our industry you know a lot
of soil companies are like not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their quality control on the compost
that they're using and they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: lower-end ingredients in their soil to
bring something to market and maybe more
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable than others, but may not
necessarily be helping the farmer because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a uncomposted product or low-end or
Has ingredients in it that are more
[SPEAKER_12]: susceptible to these spores like Peter
said Yeah, yeah, totally Ryan like even in
[SPEAKER_12]: vermiculite or pea moths or something like
that you know and again especially in the
[SPEAKER_12]: green waste a lot of these guys what they
do is You know they take the green ones
[SPEAKER_12]: from the community environments And they
let it sit in these huge anaerobic piles
[SPEAKER_12]: and just rot for about nine months And so
you know they feel like all the pathogens
[SPEAKER_12]: have been killed because it gets so high,
but that's not always the case when you're
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at microscopic pockets where these
little balls of spores are sometimes
[SPEAKER_12]: smaller than a microorganism.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're really small and they contain
colonies of powdery and downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely and that's one of
the reasons why we like pride ourselves on
[SPEAKER_01]: using the highest quality ingredients and
encouraging people to like not cut corners
[SPEAKER_01]: just because they may have some local soil
that has some mushroom compost from the
[SPEAKER_01]: local mushroom farm that hasn't really
been properly composted but is a giant
[SPEAKER_01]: waste stream so basically a lot of these
waste streams just need to be educated on
[SPEAKER_01]: how to manage them properly and the world
could have a lot more higher-end compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and That's one thing that we have coming
down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a project that we're going to work
on this We're going to be in charge of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the ingredients and the inputs and how the
compost is actually made So we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to that project for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to make compost for a lot of years
and I made a lupki compost and that's out
[SPEAKER_12]: of Germany and and what it is is it's an
insoluble humus compost and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: composted.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't let it get past 140 degrees That
way we can essentially just keep all the
[SPEAKER_12]: aerobic microbes so we do and you know
static Yeah, totally you know turned you
[SPEAKER_12]: know that that process So we would turn it
every day for the first four weeks But but
[SPEAKER_12]: even even with that compost when we did a
microbial assay on it, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, it's almost impossible to Eliminate
100% of the of the pathogenic organisms in
[SPEAKER_12]: any type of an organic material because
it's the natural balance There there are
[SPEAKER_12]: good and bad organisms within any type of
agro ecosystem so so with that being said
[SPEAKER_12]: what we've done with soil balance is we
isolated 62 strains of your beneficial
[SPEAKER_12]: microorganisms so that we don't have any
Inkling of a pathogenic in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're making micro T.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is 100% pure beneficial aerobic
Saprophytic organisms that actually work
[SPEAKER_12]: to help decompose some of the material in
a in a compost that hasn't been fully
[SPEAKER_12]: decomposed yet because even if you're a
master composter, you're never going to
[SPEAKER_12]: get 100% of the bad guys out in a in a in
a compost It's it's it's it's naturally
[SPEAKER_12]: impossible to get out all of the all of
the bad guys So you have to be careful any
[SPEAKER_12]: any organic material that you're bringing
into your grow room you know with those
[SPEAKER_12]: pockets and like you said the thing that
you said Brian that makes so much sense is
[SPEAKER_12]: that if you Inundate your environment with
tons of beneficial organisms a lot of the
[SPEAKER_12]: health issues a lot of the the the things
that people that growers trying to grow
[SPEAKER_12]: organic who are Reactive to the health
issues that they're facing They just
[SPEAKER_12]: naturally won't have them anymore kind of
like a human healthy body once your your
[SPEAKER_12]: your community is diversified You're gonna
have just plant health vigor and you're
[SPEAKER_12]: gonna have nutrient dense product because
those those beneficials will act almost as
[SPEAKER_12]: as like as like a chelating agent for the
macro micronutrients in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead go ahead wait, I just have to
mute Peters because you were getting a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of feedback and welcome to Tony
to the room as well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little more about what
you were just speaking of Peter right I I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's really important to recognize
that they're These pathogenic organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: are everywhere and it's really very
difficult to create a scenario that is
[SPEAKER_00]: free of pathogens But my experience has
been from when I worked indoors It was
[SPEAKER_00]: important to make sure everything was as
clean as possible and as many beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms as possible Now that I'm
fortunate enough to be able to work
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors on a farm where in the last
coming on eight years now I've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to build the beneficial organisms in the
soil learn how to make proper compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: source the materials that are going into
that compost and I'm finding that
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars different versions of
cannabis have better resistance than
[SPEAKER_00]: others to these various pathogens
particularly the mildews I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that some of the things that are
high in CBD low in THC, which is primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: the focus of my interest I'm really
finding that there's so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of this plant and some of them
are actually quite susceptible to mildews
[SPEAKER_00]: and others don't seem to be bothered by it
at all and They have identical situation
[SPEAKER_00]: in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things is a nursery man I'm
trying to learn more about is What
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars flourish in different scenarios
and then to try and make that information
[SPEAKER_00]: available to as many people as possible So
we can reduce some of the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts and increase the quality of the
medicine that people are producing I
[SPEAKER_00]: really think this thing you're talking
about is really important I love what
[SPEAKER_12]: you're saying and from a biological
standpoint, you know the question that you
[SPEAKER_12]: just asked why are certain cultivars more
or less resistant and and again addressing
[SPEAKER_12]: that from a biological standpoint,
I think it has a lot to do with the That
[SPEAKER_12]: each individual plant is producing,
you know, think about a natural agro
[SPEAKER_12]: ecosystem You're gonna have a different
biodiversity and different thresholds of
[SPEAKER_12]: for instance powdery or downy mildew so
that plant over time just naturally has
[SPEAKER_12]: co-evolved with its natural system to be
able to Inhibit the colonization of
[SPEAKER_12]: certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes can naturally survive So when
taking these strains and we're we're
[SPEAKER_12]: monocropping them or reproducing them in
our own environment We don't have those
[SPEAKER_12]: exact strains Aligned with that particular
plant then what's gonna happen is the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant's not gonna have its natural
Organisms that it co-evolved within
[SPEAKER_12]: nature.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes terpenes and it is necessary to
inhibit pathogen colonization Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, yes, yes That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is good stuff great panel today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love I love the diversity some new folks
in the room some old-schoolers We've got
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark Scaldone looking slightly like a
Simpsons character with history with his
[SPEAKER_07]: green hue, but welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Mark A little bit a little bit You
know what you kind of looked out the
[SPEAKER_07]: window and it almost went away a little
bit there for a second No, no,
[SPEAKER_07]: we love the green here, bro, you're green
as you like my friends So Brian are any of
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys working with the state of
California regarding the new regulations I
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're starting to talk about
organic serving Or working on that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: idea so that you know people can actually
take that full shift in the future so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can actually get Organic
certification for their cannabis in in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future in California well Indirectly,
yes, I mean we've we've taken the
[SPEAKER_01]: proactive approach of getting all of our
products certified in CDFA, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: California Department of Ag In foreseeing
that the future is gonna be that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna go that route It's much easier
for a farmer To use product that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: certified organic To get his own farm
certified so we did go that route for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're definitely working with a lot of
farms in the Monterey County and just some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the more Friendly counties that are
allowing permitting to using our products
[SPEAKER_01]: and providing MSDS sheets and providing,
you know derivation statements so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get their approval for organic
certification So we had a question from
[SPEAKER_07]: the chat room here a lot of people asking
about neem oil And it seems like half the
[SPEAKER_07]: chat rooms kind of like oh, that's yeah,
I use that it's great and the other half
[SPEAKER_07]: is like Oh, it's poison.
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many people have asked the question
what the panel thinks about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe start with Brian.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about neem oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well neem is definitely the main active
ingredient neem is azadactrin and
[SPEAKER_01]: azadactrin is a pesticide so it neem kills
things and You know, it has its time in
[SPEAKER_01]: place, you know so a lot of people been
putting neem cake and soil and neem seed
[SPEAKER_01]: meal and soil for quite some time and I've
always been like perplexed by this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: concept and It's starting to come out that
The neem seed meal is actually killing
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms in the soil and causing
anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doesn't surprise me I'm not a
scientist, but I have you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of experience being a farmer and I
just I kind of like think of a plant like
[SPEAKER_01]: a human and I like try to think what does
this plant need?
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to like how I would think how a
human would need nutrient and by giving
[SPEAKER_01]: putting neem something that's gonna kill
microorganisms in the soil has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: counterintuitive for me so something I've
always stayed away from and Now that the
[SPEAKER_01]: information is more and more is coming out
It totally makes sense to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to keep as much microbial life in
the soil as possible much oxygen We want
[SPEAKER_01]: those microorganisms to be able to breathe
down there Great answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the best use I've ever seen of neem
the most natural use I've ever seen of it
[SPEAKER_07]: was not You know extracting the oil the
plant oil and spraying it but it was in
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica where my friend had a giant neem
tree in his garden I'd never Even seen one
[SPEAKER_07]: it was like 40 feet tall big huge leaves
on the thing and the leaves would fall and
[SPEAKER_07]: then he Would just put them in the
pathways.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was growing in, you know classic
Jamaica style inside tires So all the all
[SPEAKER_07]: the earth was in the tire So it was like
even the neem that was falling on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground wasn't probably really affecting
the soil that the plants were in Although
[SPEAKER_07]: the rubber from the tires probably were
But I thought it was a neat use of neem in
[SPEAKER_07]: the sense that because I was like what are
all these leaves that you've got that were
[SPEAKER_07]: walking on over the pathways through the
plants and he's like that's neem on and I
[SPEAKER_07]: looked up and I was like Damn,
Jamaica style.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't go buy a bottle in neem.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just use the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed more natural to me I'm on grow
to tree man grow to tree, but I like your
[SPEAKER_07]: answer with this, you know affecting the
microbials that's Clearly if you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about the microbials in your soil
Then maybe neem might seem like a great
[SPEAKER_07]: idea to you but coming to the
understanding that it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially killing those Or affecting
their colony then maybe it's not such a
[SPEAKER_07]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have similar feelings about neem My
particular objection to neem is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a hormone disruptor It's it's one of the
methods that it one of the ways it works
[SPEAKER_00]: on insects is by disrupting their breeding
cycle And I think we're putting way too
[SPEAKER_00]: many Materials like that into the
environment hormone disruptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at all the weirdness that
amphibians are showing in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: from everything from birth control pills
to Soaps and whatnot who knows but with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis particularly if you're
cultivating cannabis as medicine It seems
[SPEAKER_00]: really essential to me that you wouldn't
add anything to the plant either
[SPEAKER_00]: systemically or as a foliar spray that
eventually could compromise the well-being
[SPEAKER_00]: of your end user and particularly in the
context of Caladrius Network I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: had to focus on the cleanest purest
version of cannabis medicine that is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to create and so neem is one of
the things that I ask the folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivate for Caladrius Network to if they
use it to tell us all about when and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they used it I don't want to take a chance
on hurting one of these kids that's using
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of oil a day and we end up
concentrating something like neem into
[SPEAKER_00]: their bloodstream and who knows Because
again, I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to take a conservative position I
don't want to take any chance at all of
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting that end user Well, I don't like
name oh Sorry, I was on mute go ahead I
[SPEAKER_01]: know people like Tony probably doesn't
like me much either because it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: affects the oil flavor and components and
overall profile of it, so As more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions been coming into play neem's
losing its place in cannabis if you ask me
[SPEAKER_12]: mm-hmm I have some information on the on
the plant parasitic nematodes that I could
[SPEAKER_12]: share if you guys wanna from so I work
with quite a few different scientists and
[SPEAKER_12]: With regards to like a loya giant or which
is root knot or or or stinging there's
[SPEAKER_12]: Lance nematodes, so there's there's quite
a few different plant parasitic nematodes
[SPEAKER_12]: and The plant parasitics are our carbon
feeders right so So if you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: plant parasitic nematodes what they're
gonna do is they're gonna cruise in and
[SPEAKER_12]: they're gonna go and they're gonna your
fine root hairs the the root hairs that
[SPEAKER_12]: actually absorb most of your your your
micronutrients those nematodes especially
[SPEAKER_12]: like Lance and sting are gonna those those
fine root hairs first before they attack
[SPEAKER_12]: the main root because those Am I are you
hearing me okay, but woman or is there
[SPEAKER_12]: like a static?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit of a delay, but we can
hear you okay, okay, so so those Those
[SPEAKER_12]: fine root hairs are the ones that the
nematodes eat first they got these little
[SPEAKER_12]: mouths they go and they just gobble up
because they're very like Fibrous fine
[SPEAKER_12]: root hairs, so that's the first thing that
they eat so so that's the plant parasitic
[SPEAKER_12]: nematodes Now beneficial nematodes in the
soil what those guys will do is they
[SPEAKER_12]: actually feed on Humus so think about that
so so those beneficial nematodes won't eat
[SPEAKER_12]: your roots and it will actually feed on
humus or like Mineralized carbon in the
[SPEAKER_12]: soil So so there's a big difference on the
beneficial and the plant parasitic kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: like the bad guys of the bugs the good
guys of the bugs and so so if you Have a
[SPEAKER_12]: very healthy humus rich soil you're going
to counterbalance the nematode essentially
[SPEAKER_12]: You know multicell organisms that are in
that soil if you can really increase your
[SPEAKER_12]: earthworm castings your your communication
of that soil The plant parasitics will
[SPEAKER_12]: still be there and and there's good
there's other things that you can do to
[SPEAKER_12]: inhibit You know those but that's a whole
nother conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just talking about the types really I
just wanted to let Brian know that I muted
[SPEAKER_07]: his mic so when he goes to talk to Unmuted
it was the thing that was causing the
[SPEAKER_07]: tiniest little bit of feedback on Peter's
microphone so I know you're on a phone and
[SPEAKER_07]: it might be a little bit harder,
but just try to click your mute button to
[SPEAKER_07]: unmute yourself when you talk and Yeah
There we go Just figured I'd let him know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh I might have lost him now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know So how did oh There he is.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's back, but I don't know if he can
unmute his mic now Sometimes when I mute
[SPEAKER_07]: people's mics it messes things up,
but let me see if I can unmute you Brian
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's try now.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's still muted Weird let's me mute
him but not unmute him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always been confused.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh there you're unmuted now All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if I'm causing any issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're fine Just I guess when you
don't speak it's best if you can mute Your
[SPEAKER_01]: mic on your phone there if I could figure
out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no problem I know it's trippy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm technologically challenged.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a plant guy not a computer guy Hey,
man, I'm glad you made it in today anyway
[SPEAKER_07]: to share to share with us and I'm glad
that it's because I wanted to hook you up
[SPEAKER_07]: with Peter and Yeah, and then and then
Wade was like I got to bring Wade in too
[SPEAKER_07]: because he's just like he's exactly what
all of you guys are talking about put into
[SPEAKER_07]: Three-dimensional reality for the last
yeah, I don't know how many years of his
[SPEAKER_07]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like he's a neighbor, too Yeah,
wait, I'd like to get together sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure look forward to it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come in and ask for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do Yeah, next time I'm up there an
incline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a dispensary an incline I'm gonna
have to swing over in Nevada City and come
[SPEAKER_02]: say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Absolutely, we must sash I was also
gonna say earlier when Brian was talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about or my story it was Wade Who was just
talking about not wanting this this
[SPEAKER_07]: responsibility of dealing with
catastrophically ill children who are
[SPEAKER_07]: extremely?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hypersensitive to anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just be honest our confidence our
faith what we believe in is cannabis We
[SPEAKER_07]: believe in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe in the profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe in the terpenes We believe in
the cannabinoids what we maybe don't
[SPEAKER_07]: believe in is You know a whole shit ton of
products like sprays and you know I'm with
[SPEAKER_07]: Wade on that where it's just sort of like
when in doubt Throw it out stick with the
[SPEAKER_07]: stick with the most popular best sort of
way of going about it, which is maybe by
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding plants that are You know going to
be maybe a little bit more Pushing away
[SPEAKER_07]: these these certain pests and mildews and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've definitely seen it in a room I've
gone into a room and I've seen all the
[SPEAKER_07]: cush is just covered in powdery mildew and
then there's one in the background I was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, what's that over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, that's like a Congolese You
know one of these kind of exotic cultivars
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm like Yeah, but it doesn't have any
powdery mildew Why do you have one
[SPEAKER_07]: Congolese in your room and four hundred
Kush when you grow in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_07]: Northwest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious No, I think it's a huge
thing there is a wide range of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars available and What I think we're
missing is Sharing information with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other about cultivars that flourish in the
different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Just in the folks that I've
worked with in the last few years Folk on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Central Coast or even the North Coast
have a really different set of problems if
[SPEAKER_00]: you will and and different group of
cultivars seem to flourish Between those
[SPEAKER_00]: two areas and an area like Nevada County
where I'm at we have incredibly hot very
[SPEAKER_00]: low humidity summers and meanwhile along
the coast you've got high humidity from
[SPEAKER_00]: the marine layer and Rarely do you get
high temperatures in the heat of day
[SPEAKER_00]: because the fog gets drawn in so My sense
is that what I've tried to do is learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about Like you were mentioning the
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that that's a radically
different Set of conditions that that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant evolved in then what some of the
other cultivars from The the Kush area of
[SPEAKER_00]: India might have evolved in and I think
the trick for us is sorting out What are
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of the plants we're working
with and what are the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions those plants are seeking so
that they can flourish?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I've noticed is Seems like
people aren't necessarily growing what is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most proper plant to grow for their
region Yes, people people are growing for
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of purposes somewhat financially
driven somewhat Terpene driven so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the one thing that like cannabis is like
has such a like broad spectrum of types of
[SPEAKER_01]: types of cultivars and You know where
where plants may be more appropriate May
[SPEAKER_01]: not be as desirable to some people as
others and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So That makes things really complicated as
far as like a Cannabis grower choosing a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to be able to just grow
the things that are best in your region
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all like a little variety in life
and people, you know have options so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one thing that like greenhouses and
indoor and treat and making making taking
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of your environment and
environmental controls and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that are able to do but in general it I
think providing the most natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for your plant from the soil
to the air to everything else has to
[SPEAKER_01]: always be taken into consideration so if
you are growing something that is out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your region and you may have to provide a
greenhouse for it or some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: different environment than it's normally
used to just take into consideration that
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it what it wants and it'll give you
what what you want to get from it Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I would share a little story if you want
to hear it I've worked with ACDC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a cultivar that produces CBD
about 25 or 30 times the amount of CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant material as there is THC and
Particularly for some of the kids that I
[SPEAKER_00]: work with that's really a desirable
characteristic but I believe ACDC was
[SPEAKER_00]: first a identified as a plant of interest
along the North Coast of California and
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there it seems to flourish and I've
met people who work with it indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: the beauty of indoors of course is you can
create the climate you want and ACDC The
[SPEAKER_00]: first two years I worked with it outdoors
in my garden here in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew like a fern it could barely hold
its own weight up and And then I met folk
[SPEAKER_00]: who were working with it indoors and said
no it was It's very much of a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy bearing strong plant and When I
discussed how that could be when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it outdoors and seeing something
that acted like a fern we got to the
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about temperature and humidity and
So last year I had four little plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC that I put in the ground under a
shade structure where the shade structure
[SPEAKER_00]: would allow 60% transmittance of light and
The fabric was white and meantime I use
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chips in abundance with various types
of grass types for mulch and I keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch moist for a rapid of cooling and the
ACDC last summer instead of growing like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fern very much grew like a more
conventional plant and From those four
[SPEAKER_00]: little plants that I didn't put out until
June 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got almost Just a hair over 6,000 grams
from four little plants put out June 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: and From those plants the medicine makers
I was working with then they got 1100
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of oil Which is extraordinarily 22%
yield So on their extraction Wow nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: did really well and That is way more plant
material than I've ever produced in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden in the two previous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with it and I Had more plants
then but they struggled to do heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: How did it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hexane it's a hexane extraction with a
stop flex machine Yes, and brought her
[SPEAKER_00]: back to draw the hexane off and terpene
separation at the final stages of
[SPEAKER_07]: Extraction of the solvent and was this a
high CBD cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my own theory and it May hold no
water whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I notice is when I do extractions
with mechanical screen separation Whether
[SPEAKER_07]: dry or wet bubble hash or dry sifting that
I'm able to get the Cecil and the capitate
[SPEAKER_07]: stocked trichomes But the bulbous stay
behind you get a very very small yield
[SPEAKER_07]: when you when I work with high CBD
cultivars and I my theory is is that the
[SPEAKER_07]: majority of the profile is inside those
bulbous heads and they need to be melted
[SPEAKER_07]: off or heated off steam distilled solvent
extraction, whatever In order for you to
[SPEAKER_07]: actually get that yield Have you seen a
half of a yield coming out of this
[SPEAKER_07]: material when you run it through sifting
or wet washing?
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day when I was first working
with Harlequin I Enjoyed smoking hash in
[SPEAKER_00]: those days as well and Yeah, Harlequin is
not a great producer in the hash realm Is
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience and I think it's part of why
My medicine makers were working with
[SPEAKER_00]: hexane is they got such good results for
extractions I'd be interested in hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: what Tony had to say about this because
I've heard something similar to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were just asking about Brian But I don't
really know Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know John John Burr fellow who's
not here today I'm just gonna let Tony's
[SPEAKER_07]: eaten right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll answer and then he can cheers.
[SPEAKER_07]: He can chime in right after me Just that
John Burr fellow has also seen the same
[SPEAKER_07]: thing with the Haley's Comet Cheryl T Rose
whose daughter Haley has a form of
[SPEAKER_07]: epilepsy that they came up with this high
CBD cultivar called Haley's Comet and It
[SPEAKER_07]: was the same way like when we ran it
through screens when we ran it through
[SPEAKER_07]: water hash the yields were just so low
That it you know, and it's it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: hard when you're trying to produce an
actual medicine for someone now the
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting thing was is that The much
higher yields were gotten through oil
[SPEAKER_07]: extractions, but hey and I wish Cheryl was
here to share this because it's really her
[SPEAKER_07]: information more than anyone's but She
Haley had been on this oil for some for
[SPEAKER_07]: some time and her seizures went down 80
per 80 percent some massive number She was
[SPEAKER_07]: still having seizures, but it wasn't until
she started making bubble hash with this
[SPEAKER_07]: particular cultivar that she went like She
stopped all her seizures now I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: they have come back because I think that
they maybe lost the cultivar or something
[SPEAKER_07]: had happened, but she went for Hundreds of
days maybe over 200 I'd have to once again
[SPEAKER_07]: get Cheryl T Rose and any of you want to
Google Cheryl Rose as well as Haley you
[SPEAKER_07]: can find out all about them and go support
them because they're really good people
[SPEAKER_07]: but just some interesting thing that I
found wouldn't it be interesting if CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: was being produced in higher amounts in
bulbous trichomes and if so why Did they
[SPEAKER_00]: winterize the hexane extract It was all
done Yeah with temperature and vacuum I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure exactly what you mean by
winterize, but no the plant material would
[SPEAKER_00]: get dried to one or two percent moisture
content and Dissolve what?
[SPEAKER_09]: and lipids right if you're gonna dissolve
those components they have to be removed
[SPEAKER_09]: and Winterization is the process by which
they're removed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just wondering if they winterized
their hexane extract Because you're gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: get an oil from that like you said they're
getting CBD oil well Purified CBD we all
[SPEAKER_09]: knows a crit white crystal and solid so
what are the other components that are in
[SPEAKER_09]: there?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in the oil that they
extracted we've seen as much as I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the specific variety,
but we had a 70 some percent CBD and 2%
[SPEAKER_09]: THC Oil that in abundance right so there's
about 25 26 28 percent other stuff in
[SPEAKER_09]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's probably Other extracted fats
and waxes is my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a heavy oil tari not clear at
all But again because I don't know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying for a whole plant extract I
want all of it I asked the guys to mix the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes back into the oil when they give
it to us They did be in the in the socks
[SPEAKER_09]: litics Extraction no no most of the oil is
still in the acid form that's interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: that that's really kind of cool because
you would think in the So a saw I'll
[SPEAKER_09]: explain what it is socks lit is so socks
lit is kind of like a little cup That sits
[SPEAKER_09]: in the reflux zone of a solvent that's
being boiled and so in this case It's
[SPEAKER_09]: hexane and so what happens is the hexane
vapor?
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of recondenses on the Cooling coils
cold finger or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the cold surface in there Some
people typically call the reflux Condenser
[SPEAKER_09]: and so from the condenser then the fresh
solvent drops over the plant material And
[SPEAKER_09]: then goes back into the pot, and it just
does that it's kind of like making coffee,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes coffee percolator not a single you
know pass curing or something This is like
[SPEAKER_09]: the coffee percolator that you put coffee
to and you put water into boil it like the
[SPEAKER_09]: Cowboys did you know on the?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know stove or something so and yeah,
so the socks lit is basically interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: because Again, you're passing through
hexane After it's condensed so it's no
[SPEAKER_09]: longer hot But it's typically in a hot
zone of a condenser in that you're it's
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of below where the Where the reflux
condenser is which again is stuff that
[SPEAKER_09]: being condensed back at you know room
temperature So it's basically just running
[SPEAKER_09]: through there, but you're going to
concentrate In the hexane pot down below
[SPEAKER_09]: which then they strip on the rotavap and
again You could probably strip hexane
[SPEAKER_09]: without doing much decarb.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just surprised that in that whole
socks lit extraction process they can't
[SPEAKER_09]: they can't just Decarb now another
interesting thing is a good
[SPEAKER_09]: recrystallization Solvent for the
cannabinoid acids are things like hexane
[SPEAKER_09]: and pentane They're very very nonpolar and
if you could saturate that solution on
[SPEAKER_09]: your rotavap Might be able to chill it
down Cryogenically and actually crash out
[SPEAKER_09]: CBDA crystals So it would be cool if you
can actually concentrate and make a CBDA
[SPEAKER_09]: Isolate that's that concentrated you can
just crash out the the crystals CBDA is
[SPEAKER_09]: somewhat of an Elusive thing again,
just because of decarboxylation So if you
[SPEAKER_09]: take like an ethanol extract or if you do
anything where you have to do multiple
[SPEAKER_09]: strippings on rotavap You figure that
you're gonna end up heating it up to some
[SPEAKER_09]: point that you may get some Aventitious
decarboxylation but being able to get CBDA
[SPEAKER_09]: as a crystalline solid would be really
fucking cool because then you could just
[SPEAKER_09]: you know decarboxylate that to be
Activated CBD without having all the other
[SPEAKER_09]: Fats waxes and lipids and those are the
often the culprits for giving those
[SPEAKER_09]: purified cannabinoids off flavors because
when the fats Waxes and lipids are heated
[SPEAKER_09]: up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They thermally degrade into noxious
smelling compounds Good Well, thanks for
[SPEAKER_07]: that knowledge drop and welcome skunk man
Sam and Alec from SC labs To the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we got a full panel gentlemen
almost 700 people on the live you in and
[SPEAKER_07]: Alec is bumping Testing good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Passed this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out what was wrong with the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was plugged in two different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'd like to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry the kind I've forgotten your
name Peter Peter you know I sent off for
[SPEAKER_03]: some of your stuff and then I was talking
to my friend who still lives in
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillipsburg campus and He volunteered to
go over to where the largest 7,000 acre
[SPEAKER_03]: plants of pot growing that I've ever seen
in a long time besides the Rishi Keshe
[SPEAKER_03]: India, but he volunteered to go over and
dig around amongst the roots and Send me a
[SPEAKER_03]: sample of the stuff He came up with and I
thought maybe you might be interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: having that Sample to have a look at
because it's just marijuana plants growing
[SPEAKER_12]: there Yeah, so what we can do is we can
actually test the Colonies that are
[SPEAKER_12]: actually conducive to cannabis plant
growth in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do microbial analysis basically and
we look at all the the different
[SPEAKER_12]: beneficials of That we know are going to
be conducive to all of the things that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're talking about and we can actually
isolate and tell you how many what are
[SPEAKER_12]: called colony forming units or
microorganisms program of soil that you
[SPEAKER_12]: contain not only in the soil aggregates
but in the in the rhizosphere so if you
[SPEAKER_12]: wanted to send us a sample I could pretty
much analyze you know the beneficials that
[SPEAKER_12]: are there and And that and you could you
could start to do that something that our
[SPEAKER_12]: company hopefully will begin to do in the
future Is is help people become microbe
[SPEAKER_12]: farmers?
[SPEAKER_12]: you know and and actually have a
precedence on the amount of colony forming
[SPEAKER_12]: units or microorganisms per gram of soil
that are conducive to the results that you
[SPEAKER_12]: guys are all talking about which which
interrelate to every aspect of What those
[SPEAKER_12]: plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic capability I Really love the panel
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta say just looking at you know
master breeder skunk man Sam and the work
[SPEAKER_07]: that Wade's done with the AC DC and the
harlequin you got Brian in from vital like
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to share the good soil information
Alex from s Alec from SC labs coming in
[SPEAKER_07]: who's testing everything?
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter with the soil balance the living
bacteria is to say Symbiotically live on
[SPEAKER_07]: the roots and up you know and then you've
got ours the scientists marks shall Shall
[SPEAKER_07]: don't in the house laying it down What it
yeah and congratulations on your new
[SPEAKER_07]: patent bro like seriously?
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, and then it doesn't it
doesn't even end there because then we
[SPEAKER_07]: have Indra old-school You know storyteller
extraordinaire with like the oil History
[SPEAKER_07]: that goes back 30 plus years and then the
future we got Tony Verzura who's pumping
[SPEAKER_07]: out products like you can't even believe
xylitol sugars and terps syrups and Blow
[SPEAKER_07]: in my mind even dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the bubble man, and you all humble me
Thank you all for sharing your time today,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know the panel or the chat room
right now is absolutely loving this so
[SPEAKER_12]: thank you everybody Beautiful synergy man
that you've created so you are an eclectic
[SPEAKER_12]: human being who's brought some amazing
individuals here, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude right on So I guess what's the
talk about maybe a little bit about
[SPEAKER_07]: chalice?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what did they give you a backpack
for all those trophies Tony?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know it was a pretty it was a
pretty interesting There's a pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: interesting event.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still going on today, but I felt kind
of geeky I think so did Joe but when Alex
[SPEAKER_10]: Alex was kind of telling people on Did he
disappear from this panel?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's just such a big panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you have to move Yeah, so You know I
think that what you guys are talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: really important.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think of all coming down to
responsibility and also education You know
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're going to be in the industry you
have to take some responsibility and if we
[SPEAKER_10]: had a commission like there's an NFL
Commission or There's different industries
[SPEAKER_10]: and organizations out there that have to
abide by commissions And those commissions
[SPEAKER_10]: haven't been set up yet for for cannabis
yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still we're still working on trying
to regulate this and Monitor every gram
[SPEAKER_10]: and make sure people aren't You know in
these regulated states.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not using pesticides and
concentrating them and putting them into
[SPEAKER_10]: edibles and into Public which is harm's
way But there's no real repercussions of
[SPEAKER_10]: Responsibility and so when you look at
when you look at that and you say okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's things that I would like to
say that part what we need to create the
[SPEAKER_10]: Ten Commandments if you will the things
that are not Acceptable if you're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be in the industry, and if you're going to
be in the industry you need to be held
[SPEAKER_10]: Accountable you know and there's things
there's things That are out there that
[SPEAKER_10]: exist that believe and blow my mind So a
lot of people with the prohibition based
[SPEAKER_10]: mentality think that Specifically in the
distillate world that somehow you can make
[SPEAKER_10]: some kind of shitty contaminated BHO and
Clean it up into some magical golden oil
[SPEAKER_10]: that That is that will test clean of all
contaminants pesticides residuals and
[SPEAKER_10]: things and maybe once upon a time that was
like a thing to do to like take somebody's
[SPEAKER_10]: really dirty oil and do that but I think
that the competition that that was held at
[SPEAKER_10]: Chalice and The standards that the labs
are trying to be preaching to everyone out
[SPEAKER_10]: there Isn't necessarily just about
pesticides, but it's a responsibility as
[SPEAKER_10]: the grower and the extractor come together
To produce a product that is acceptable
[SPEAKER_10]: for public consumption since there's no
Commission and no one's really regulating
[SPEAKER_10]: that right now Especially in California
where there's the biggest you know one of
[SPEAKER_10]: the biggest markets in the country if not
the world and so In the in the categories
[SPEAKER_10]: that we had You know with distillation is
we're not we're not taking some kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: Contaminated shitty BHO and turning it
into magic.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we're doing whole plant
Extractions on flowers that were grown By
[SPEAKER_10]: unbelievable growers what you know
greenhouse growers like lemon tree all
[SPEAKER_10]: organic and what Brian was talking about
with certified green Growers these are
[SPEAKER_10]: growers that go through particular
certification processes In which they
[SPEAKER_10]: don't spray their plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have healthy genetics And they have a
healthy way of sustaining those genetics
[SPEAKER_10]: and what I mean by that the responsibility
is You know, you've got to be able to have
[SPEAKER_10]: the right starting material So we're we're
starting with the best material making the
[SPEAKER_10]: best particular oil that we could make
then a distillation is just a final
[SPEAKER_10]: refinement of cleaning it up to the most
Highest concentration.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have any any hiccups along the
way, you're just going to constantly
[SPEAKER_10]: Concentrate your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really when somebody says distillation
think microscope very very very very very
[SPEAKER_10]: very strong microscope into what you're
doing and So it's not it's not a process
[SPEAKER_10]: in which you should use to fix a mistake
but rather Refine your process to the
[SPEAKER_10]: highest quality and standard that could be
if that's the desired product And now I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna put some people on glass so I told
some people I'm gonna go a little further.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to do this to people but I'm not
gonna call any names out but I'll show you
[SPEAKER_10]: some of the things that are not Acceptable
in our industry and if there was a
[SPEAKER_10]: commission I would find this person five
hundred thousand dollars in ten years out
[SPEAKER_10]: ten years to be out from the industry
without without review so if we had a
[SPEAKER_10]: commission of cannabis And you saw what
I'm about to show you This person this
[SPEAKER_10]: these types of people should be fined
minimum half a million to a million
[SPEAKER_10]: dollars for the damage in which they're
causing and They don't know and we're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna talk about why they got here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's look Let's look at this phone and
you will be seeing something That's crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're looking at people is the
spider mites covered buds come That's what
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like worst-case scenario That's as
bad as it gets if you see a bed completely
[SPEAKER_02]: covered like that burn it with fire It's
not extractable That made me feel sick
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly made my heartbeat really fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is nothing you can do when you get
to this stage Except pull out a fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: blowtorch and torture entire garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's negligence at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the property That's beyond
negligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just outright denial.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean not to smoke cash with Mark When
they put people on blast last year and
[SPEAKER_10]: they said hey by the way you entered
Chalice and this is what you failed There
[SPEAKER_10]: was you know, I think there was like 80 or
90 percent this year knowing that that
[SPEAKER_10]: would put you on blast Actually,
I feel like there was a some change that
[SPEAKER_10]: happened because there was about 40 or 50
percent even though even though they knew
[SPEAKER_10]: they were going into competition mode and
they get all of their stuff before it ever
[SPEAKER_10]: even gets entered because SC labs could
test your shit before you even enter it so
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you're going into competition
mode and you know, they're gonna put you
[SPEAKER_10]: they're gonna put you out and they're
gonna put you on blast so this year about
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 or 50 percent and In some categories 20
percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was happy to see the numbers Changed
substantially down because people are
[SPEAKER_10]: becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_10]: Pesticides you could die There's there's
the word is death There's there's
[SPEAKER_10]: catastrophic human Change that can happen
when you are consuming Pesticides or
[SPEAKER_10]: combinations of pesticides, which we're
gonna talk about and concentrates of them
[SPEAKER_10]: and Yeah, we talked about this is
something to keep in mind we talked about
[SPEAKER_10]: if you take a clone from Say a mothering
room and they use Eagle 20 And it's
[SPEAKER_10]: stomach and it's in the plant and they
clone it and then they're like,
[SPEAKER_10]: okay We've got tons of these clones and
that grower never uses pesticides tough
[SPEAKER_10]: titty He's just you're growing with
contaminated genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the genetics is extremely important
We all started from seed If we all started
[SPEAKER_10]: from seed we have a very fair shot of
having something That's clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you start from a clone,
you need to have a clean room so when you
[SPEAKER_10]: walk when I walk into other people's grows
and Trust me.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's examples of the opposite of what I
showed you like when we talk about You
[SPEAKER_10]: know, we're working with green dragon who
is the complete opposite of a girl like
[SPEAKER_10]: that Who's monitoring All of these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have if you see a grow and
somebody's like, oh, yeah Where do you get
[SPEAKER_10]: your clones from?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you get your mother's from?
[SPEAKER_10]: And and there is no mother room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and you're cloning from your garden
So if you're cloning from your garden,
[SPEAKER_10]: you better be the best fucking grower and
have all of these points in place and all
[SPEAKER_10]: these checks in place because Imagine your
this is how this garden got this way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay at one point They had a grow their
first pull or their second pull was pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: decent and all of a sudden some of the
girls got a little cough The weather
[SPEAKER_10]: changed right they get a little bit of a
condition you get a little scratchy
[SPEAKER_10]: throat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, let's uh, let's use a little let's use
this remedy here and It might be a
[SPEAKER_10]: pesticide or it might be some kind of
chemical that will Try to help this cough.
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of this instead of you know,
they're being a Cough once a week.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little scratch a little cough
then they clone it So now you cloned Your
[SPEAKER_10]: first condition and you passed it along
the chain then let's say if it was humans,
[SPEAKER_10]: let's say That that particular batch now
has cancer Okay, and then you clone it
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got the cough.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got cancer Then the next time well,
let's just throw AIDS at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's throw a mess at it Let's just start
throwing every possible health condition
[SPEAKER_10]: you could possibly Throw into this into
this gene mix and keep mixing and keep
[SPEAKER_10]: cloning and click cloning so eventually
where you get is you've got cocktails of
[SPEAKER_10]: Pesticides and different chemicals that
you're fighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've got thrifts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got green moss that produces more and
Having topside spiders Full-on webs around
[SPEAKER_10]: your buds is not acceptable Vacuuming them
off washing them in hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_07]: vacuuming them off I Would drop a nuclear
bomb on that facility I would first go and
[SPEAKER_07]: apologize to all my neighbors and let them
punch me in the face as many times as they
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to Because I'm seriously sick to my
stomach for their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even joking that is I can honestly
say Tony that I've seen much worse Where
[SPEAKER_07]: visiting visiting somewhere in your own
garden People's greenhouse abilities
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially novice growers who just have no
experience Yeah, I had to say I saw a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar situation in Los Angeles back in
the late 90s and the entire the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: garden which was probably eight by eight
and every bud looked just like that and
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy was like what's wrong like fire
fire fire I was like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can produce a special product that we
used to produce called mighty weed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: well if you were yeah exactly if you were
growing for the bugs, this is what I said
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I don't know if you're just in the
business for Eating spider mites mutated
[SPEAKER_10]: spider mites for our generations to come
Because you've done an excellent job with
[SPEAKER_10]: cocktail bombs of every type of pesticide
You could possibly throw at this thing and
[SPEAKER_10]: you've got a top-side party I mean these
are these this is like two pox come back
[SPEAKER_10]: and he's like If you use pesticides your
plants would have looked a lot better it
[SPEAKER_07]: just would be terrible for you Listen
since you started talking Tony the look on
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian and Wade And Peter's face has just
been on because we started this
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation with the highest integrity
the Children the like this is why we're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing this it is kind of crazy to see just
metaphorically how ridiculous these Some
[SPEAKER_07]: of these contests are man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what are people thinking?
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody that's growing Would think that's
acceptable and it's not acceptable No,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, we as a group need to take people
like that and do the Game of Thrones strip
[SPEAKER_02]: him naked Walk behind him with bells shame
shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you should be doing at shallow
She should be walking with having those
[SPEAKER_02]: bastards walk around Naked feeling Well,
listen, it's one thing for a contest It's
[SPEAKER_07]: one thing for a recreational market the
fact that it could be leeching over into
[SPEAKER_07]: this medicinal component into this like
for people who are really sick like it
[SPEAKER_07]: becomes it becomes really not funny and
Side note and I'm gonna get right back to
[SPEAKER_07]: you Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to shout out Etienne because I
forgot Etienne How could you forget
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been first in the room every day for
the last hundred and forty six episodes
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy's been an activist longer than
I've been into cannabis He's definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: one of the pioneers and he's one of the
kindest souls I've ever met So I do want
[SPEAKER_07]: to shout out as well as I already did the
rest of the panel my good friend Etienne
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being you Thank you kindly and
I want to give a shout out to my
[SPEAKER_02]: biological father he passed away a day
before yesterday, so Thank you very much
[SPEAKER_02]: for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody have shown and I'm doing my
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's good and I appreciate the
love there, but much love much love Just
[SPEAKER_13]: just just to kind of throw in you know,
just from what Tony and you know Everybody
[SPEAKER_13]: was just kind of discussing with regards
to you know, kind of some nasty,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know practices oftentimes unknowingly
nasty And practices completely ignorant,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know practices that are being made,
you know, especially around using a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: these systemic pesticides You know one of
the it's something that just complicates
[SPEAKER_13]: the whole topic that much more also is you
know the difference of whether or not
[SPEAKER_13]: Plants were grown under the Sun exposed
UVA B and C versus any type of indoor
[SPEAKER_13]: lighting Which is completely void any type
of UVA B or C which is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_13]: thing that is what's breaking down
systemic residual pesticides, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: and so you know for so long You know
working within the hydroponic industry
[SPEAKER_13]: hydro stores, you know So much information
was passed out to the community and you
[SPEAKER_13]: know on forums everybody thought you know,
oh the you know Eagle 20 lasts 60 days or
[SPEAKER_13]: 40 days residual a on the plan,
you know, it's just this kind of like
[SPEAKER_13]: ignorantly agreed upon kind of Thought you
know to justify, you know somewhat
[SPEAKER_13]: unscrupulous actions of you know people
just getting away with spraying whenever
[SPEAKER_13]: they spray because they didn't
preventively take care of their issues and
[SPEAKER_13]: instead they're reacting To full web mode,
you know, and so and so, you know with
[SPEAKER_13]: that being said it's like once moms are
Treated or what have you and then grown
[SPEAKER_13]: in, you know indoor lighting mom rooms,
you know, you know I'm very curious on how
[SPEAKER_13]: much longer the you know systemic residue
is compared to you know, something that
[SPEAKER_13]: might be grown under the Sun, you know,
which in its own is gonna have a really
[SPEAKER_09]: long residue residue effect, but You bring
up a good point because the Eagle 20
[SPEAKER_09]: belongs to the class of Azoles and all
Azoles require biological degradation to
[SPEAKER_09]: basically degrade those in the environment
and again in an indoor environment where
[SPEAKER_09]: you have a different microbiome than you
have Outside and like you bring up a good
[SPEAKER_09]: point with photolithic degradation,
but the microbiome The pseudomonads that
[SPEAKER_09]: live in the soil are basically the things
that are responsible for most of the
[SPEAKER_09]: degradation of those things and most
Azoles fungicides like myconazole and
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff like that are very low mammalian
toxicity, you know, they don't really have
[SPEAKER_09]: much I mean they're used for athletes foot
and you know you know those types of
[SPEAKER_09]: topical applications for You know yeast
infections and stuff like that because
[SPEAKER_09]: they're very broad spectrum and they're
typically low toxicity What is the issue
[SPEAKER_09]: is when they're when they're heated it
will concentrated and when you're heated
[SPEAKER_09]: up because most of those are chuck full of
nitrogens and a lot of those nitrogen
[SPEAKER_09]: containing compounds degrade to all kinds
of nitroso and Oxides and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_09]: Hoffman degradation products that you
don't want to be inhaling into your into
[SPEAKER_00]: your Isn't formaldehyde one of those?
[SPEAKER_09]: Formaldehyde is just in general a
degradation product.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just Almost ubiquitous in the
environment right now because it's used in
[SPEAKER_09]: So many different applications as a
monomer in plastics the monomer of big
[SPEAKER_09]: plot of big lighters Which is basically
formal in just poly formaldehyde is
[SPEAKER_09]: formaldehyde itself And so yeah when those
things thermally degrade they release
[SPEAKER_09]: formaldehyde what they're finding now is
paraffin based candles like I don't want
[SPEAKER_09]: to call and throw under the bus but like
Yankee candle brand and most popular brand
[SPEAKER_09]: candles that are paraffin based Have a lot
of residual formaldehyde and formaldehyde
[SPEAKER_09]: components and degradation crap that's
left behind and they don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_09]: you know responsible for you know cancer
or anything, but it's just exposing people
[SPEAKER_09]: more to formaldehyde and yeah formaldehyde
is typically a Thing you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_09]: exposed to if you can help But to get back
to the Azoles for a second the thing with
[SPEAKER_09]: who you calling an Azole They're con and
con Azoles or man.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like Tebuconazole, Propiconazole,
Flucilazole There's so many different
[SPEAKER_09]: ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just amazing somehow that the one
that when thermally heats You know can
[SPEAKER_09]: degrade and give off cyanide.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one in Eagle 20, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just amazing that that's the one
that's so widely used There's so many
[SPEAKER_09]: other ones that you don't have the cyanide
issue with at all And that's the only one
[SPEAKER_09]: really that I could think of that It's got
the you know, you heat this up and
[SPEAKER_09]: basically it degrades the hydrogen
cyanide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's at a much lower Concentration
typically but again when you concentrate
[SPEAKER_09]: these things into concentrates God knows
if you have something that's in high
[SPEAKER_09]: concentration could you actually get
enough cyanide to basically get The dab
[SPEAKER_09]: that will essentially kill you because
you're overwhelmed by cyanide.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that that's actually
Possible unless it's in there in like
[SPEAKER_09]: super super high levels Because if it's
based on the actual toxic dose of hydrogen
[SPEAKER_09]: cyanide You would need to have a lot of
Eagle 20 in your dab to basically keel
[SPEAKER_12]: over from it Well, let me let me force you
those of those that the synthetics over
[SPEAKER_10]: time Yeah, I was gonna share a couple
things that you guys are talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: also with the different extractions Let's
let's stick to bubble hash for one moment
[SPEAKER_10]: and pesticides What we what we do now is
we work for different farms particularly
[SPEAKER_10]: for whether it's Prana or bubble man now,
but let's let's stick to Prana because
[SPEAKER_10]: that's the one that I usually Taking
intake on CBD material and I've bought
[SPEAKER_10]: material from Wade before and from from
Brian so on the opposite note hats off to
[SPEAKER_10]: the people that actually Know how to grow
and understand that from the second relief
[SPEAKER_10]: is out of the plant There's there's resin
there and what you put into the plan is
[SPEAKER_10]: what you're gonna get out of it Every time
and so my hats are off to the people that
[SPEAKER_10]: are actually doing a good job because
those are the ones that I seek out But we
[SPEAKER_10]: have a count with that seat in a bulk
testing And now what we do is as soon as
[SPEAKER_10]: we get flowers We we say okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, is there a pesticide test?
[SPEAKER_10]: Done at the lab if the answer is no,
then we send the flowers off.
[SPEAKER_10]: We take 10 grams of the flowers and press
those flowers off we take That flower oil
[SPEAKER_10]: and we send that off we clean the plates
and clean everything and sterilize and UV
[SPEAKER_10]: between each one of those runs of flowers
And we have one particular we have three
[SPEAKER_10]: presses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have one particular press we can
dedicate to that so We get a concentrate
[SPEAKER_10]: we get a plant might test under the the
pesticide level But then if you make a
[SPEAKER_10]: flower oil and this is why I would say a
lot of people are kind of against flower
[SPEAKER_10]: rosin Because you have to have extremely
clean flowers because then you're just
[SPEAKER_10]: you're concentrating All of these oils and
anything that's on the plant right there
[SPEAKER_10]: without any kind of first second pass or
any kind of refinement like what Indra
[SPEAKER_10]: does You know with a hydrocarbon or anyone
else that would use a solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got different passes and
refinements that they can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: things out so a lot of crazy failure so To
the point where I actually called my
[SPEAKER_10]: manager to tell I see labs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, by the way, we're not making this
We're just testing batches for different
[SPEAKER_10]: people that want us to buy and it's
failing pretty poorly but in the water
[SPEAKER_10]: hash, so With flowers you might not see it
until it's concentrated And then it's too
[SPEAKER_10]: late and then you're down the road with
all of your medicine and your lab
[SPEAKER_10]: contaminated So there's a step there,
but with particular water hash what I've
[SPEAKER_10]: seen and I've seen this twice now Not
saying anyone's names or anything like
[SPEAKER_10]: that, but these are different farmers that
are growing outdoors in greenhouse and The
[SPEAKER_10]: trim itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they said oh, well, we don't use any
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're clean Okay, that might be fair.
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of my friends said Hey,
do you want to buy it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know this full spectrum bubble hash
and the bubble hash was testing in the
[SPEAKER_10]: parts per parts for a million like two to
four so washing the resident Separating
[SPEAKER_09]: the resident might have might have got
what was the contaminant Tony?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was a Micro micro brutal or
whatever Michael, you know, you go Tony
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was like bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd sent something to you and it was like
four part.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a four Not point four not
point go one point four.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was four And that was in the rosin
concentration.
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought that maybe the hash didn't
have it So they tried they tested the
[SPEAKER_10]: bubble and then they tested the hash rosin
in both Both of them tested highly
[SPEAKER_10]: positive So what I'm getting at is that
for whatever reason even if you're washing
[SPEAKER_10]: and separating the resin There might you
might be able to not see any PM because we
[SPEAKER_10]: talked about this before we're actually
around the resident You might not actually
[SPEAKER_10]: see any PM but The pesticides are getting
in that are attaching themselves are
[SPEAKER_10]: getting into that resin in some capacity
And that's the flower The resin not the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant material, but you didn't test the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have the plant material to test
they were trying to sell They're trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: give us bubble and then they were trying
to give us hash rosin And both of them
[SPEAKER_10]: would test positive But what I'm getting
at is the resin so somebody watched it
[SPEAKER_10]: separated Dried it Went through that
process.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still in the resin is what I'm
getting at so it's not just in the it's
[SPEAKER_10]: Inherently in just that thing the actual
resin so so what I'm hearing is going on a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot is people are even like testing their
flower and it's coming in clean and then
[SPEAKER_01]: when it concentrates then they're seeing
signs of Some of these other toxic
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides That was the reason why I was
asking tell me that's what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_09]: here is you're not seeing in the flower
you think the flowers process the flower
[SPEAKER_09]: into a Hasher or rosin in this case and
now the rosin is coming up hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what I'm hearing?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that's like
really scary to me because here are all
[SPEAKER_01]: these people sourcing plants from all over
the place and That who knows how many
[SPEAKER_01]: generations down the line There could have
been this you know toxic chemical use
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's still gonna show up So that's
something that well vital and working with
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry Yeah, yeah, I was just gonna say
here's where we're sample preparation and
[SPEAKER_09]: sample collection if you're Processing a
whole lot of material, but you're only
[SPEAKER_09]: taking a bud from this branch over here
Well again, you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_09]: represent the entirety of the material if
you're gonna be doing a statistically
[SPEAKER_09]: Significant measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we got to take a more
proactive approach on the other end of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and provide clean plants so farmers
can Be assured that they're gonna make
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that is acceptable in our modern
test right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're buying wholesale or you know,
you have a deal and it's like okay
[SPEAKER_09]: someone's bringing you the herb it looks
really good, but you know You don't know
[SPEAKER_09]: whether or not it's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to do a really statistically
valid Measurement of the entire batch to
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that you don't have pesticide
contamination Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah real quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually what we're using the
flower rising for so somebody has ten
[SPEAKER_10]: pounds You could you could take 20 grams
randomly from those ten pounds stuff a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple screens press out 20 20 grams get a
blend all those batches.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I like flowers and then you get
the flowers and just for testing purposes
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a good way to test for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay now I've got I've got two or three
grams to send to the lab and do that it's
[SPEAKER_10]: a super good way to To check that before
you get too down, but I also think this
[SPEAKER_10]: opens up a new a new era of clone
certification meaning when the plants in
[SPEAKER_10]: its mother stage Take a take a cut of the
leaf go get the leaf tested And get us and
[SPEAKER_10]: see if we can get maybe this doesn't exist
yet But I thought maybe it could get there
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's you could probably answer this
But if there was a way to test the leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: not the bud while it's in bed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah Yeah, no, that's I mean, that's when
it's gonna be in the highest Concentration
[SPEAKER_13]: ever, you know seen by the plant,
you know in the time when it was dip So I
[SPEAKER_10]: mean just I mean if we had a mother so if
we say okay, where are these?
[SPEAKER_10]: Clones from this mother was certified then
we made these clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: These clones are now Have to go through a
certification process and then the genetic
[SPEAKER_10]: banks is where it starts So if you're
gonna be a clone bank where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: be a genetic thing You need to have these
certification processes because farmers
[SPEAKER_10]: like what Brian is saying is They say
let's say the farmer does everything
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got live soils.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's doing the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got been controlled.
[SPEAKER_10]: He fucking slaves over months He's bought
all these these clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, I'm an all-organic grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't test positive in his flowers
Somebody says okay great We're getting
[SPEAKER_10]: this, you know, our collective is gonna
purchase these flowers and make it into
[SPEAKER_10]: all this great amazing medicine We do a
quick rosin test or a first batch of
[SPEAKER_10]: bubble and it's wonk wonk And now you know
and now they failed but they didn't do
[SPEAKER_10]: anything particularly wrong This is
happening all over so now we're actually
[SPEAKER_10]: Destroying and pushing out good farmers
that are trying to try to to be in the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry because we don't have this this
very significant first step Checks in
[SPEAKER_13]: balance on the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know and and Tony and you know on
that, you know, I think I think there's a
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a couple a couple things I wanted
to kind of bring up on that point As you
[SPEAKER_13]: know with if you're farming you're going
to herb, you know, it's I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's pretty cut and dry You know you
either sprayed a systemic or you didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: you either sourced Treated clones that you
know were treated by you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know moms The mom plants are treated
with a midocloprid or forbid or whatever,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know Or you're growing them in the
house or you know from seed where you're
[SPEAKER_13]: able to control that Supply chain aspect
that much more or even more horrifying,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and you know You could run into
this whole idea Which in the national
[SPEAKER_13]: organic program?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an acronym for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the Eureka you are EC,
which is unavoidable residual
[SPEAKER_13]: environmental combination and it's a term
used to like that the National Organic
[SPEAKER_13]: Program has an effect to help organic
products still get on the market You know
[SPEAKER_13]: for people that are certified organic But
you know, they're in between the
[SPEAKER_13]: neighboring strawberry farm and grape farm
who like aerial dive bombs with like
[SPEAKER_13]: microbutanol You know, but yet there are
certified organic, you know and this whole
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of idea of trace part per billion
Detectable levels of these pesticides,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know coming from the inputs that we
use, you know and source, you know for
[SPEAKER_13]: certain dirty sources of compost like in
Colorado where You know kind of lighting
[SPEAKER_13]: people off for a midocloprid and it came
back to this, you know, heady source of
[SPEAKER_13]: compost That's you know, that's that's you
know, ultimately being made from kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: municipality kind of lawn trimmings You
know that are treated with a midocloprid
[SPEAKER_13]: and so so I mean the whole input new
realities Such a major issue now because
[SPEAKER_13]: of all these unlisted Sorry one second
Well and coupled with the ability to look
[SPEAKER_09]: at the part per billion level because when
you look at part per billion You're
[SPEAKER_09]: looking you're gonna find Just a whole
host of everything because it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I liken it Taking a lint brush to a New
York City sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna Hey Mitch was saying
something good talking about that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: get right back to it in one second Alec I
just wanted to mention what Mitch had said
[SPEAKER_07]: in the room, which was a simple You know
asking these growers when they're you
[SPEAKER_07]: know, giving their material to be to be
processed or first tested You know to get
[SPEAKER_07]: a sample of their water or at least be
told what kind of water that are using and
[SPEAKER_07]: what the nutrients are Like what are you
using?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tell me what you're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a list I want to know what you're
using.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to find it later Just tell me
what series of interviews that goes on now
[SPEAKER_10]: At least from my end.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like it becomes an intimate like
interviewer.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about Let's talk about
everything It becomes an investigation How
[SPEAKER_10]: long did that investigation take an hour
and a half of you and I talking to him
[SPEAKER_10]: about every single step of his Entire grow
and what he goes through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you using quest?
[SPEAKER_10]: Filtrations and HEPA filters and UVs in
your rooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are your mothers like?
[SPEAKER_10]: What are your conditions like where your
genetics coming from?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like a plethora of every
single you know You don't even need to ask
[SPEAKER_07]: any of those questions in a sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just say listen We're passing this
on to the scientists and they're gonna run
[SPEAKER_07]: it through all sorts of fancy machines and
come up with numbers and graphs and man
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you it's gonna look bad on
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you put some shit in here, you weren't
supposed to go ahead Alec One thing I was
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna say sorry to interrupt real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to cut out soon, but I'm
involved in a project and we're working
[SPEAKER_01]: closely with SC labs and in viral can
we're actually Pacific Reserve is the name
[SPEAKER_01]: of our nursery We're opening in Monterey
County and we're gonna specialize in clean
[SPEAKER_01]: green organic certified Genetics that
people don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing that are not gonna be
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big important part of my whole
concerns as far as being an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate and allowing Getting product to
people so they can do their job without
[SPEAKER_01]: having problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any idea how many generations?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say you have a mother plant that's
made the fuck out of some of these with
[SPEAKER_11]: some of these systemic Then you make us a
small clone from it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You grow that at another facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's totally clean And there is still
little tiny bits of systemic left in that
[SPEAKER_11]: plant So you grow it big and you chop it
up and you start making more clones.
[SPEAKER_11]: You treat it as a mother clone We are many
generations will these materials keep
[SPEAKER_11]: showing up how systemic are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's something that I can't answer
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to learn this and One
thing we're doing is and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons we're working in SC labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing more and more tests And now
that we have a platform where we could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow more plants and test more We
we are, you know actively doing that the
[SPEAKER_01]: one the one way I know that cleans up
plants and genetics is tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another part of our business that
we're gonna expand into at the nursery as
[SPEAKER_11]: well and For example the grape industry in
California They for for wine they supply
[SPEAKER_11]: root stock, which is guaranteed virus free
it would be easy enough to do the same
[SPEAKER_11]: thing with cannabis with systemic poisons
and viruses because Even from seed you get
[SPEAKER_11]: viruses Viruses can carry over and
cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's clean from pesticides, but not from
diseases Interesting well, it's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely absolutely Well, I just wanted
to thank everybody for having me on I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: love to be on again This has been a really
incredible experience and incredible panel
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys have had today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some other obligations So I'm
gonna have to cut out and I love real
[SPEAKER_13]: quick Ryan Yeah, if you know, yeah,
I just just didn't reference that,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, I mean where you know I have
such a deep respect for kind of this,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know the teaming with microbe kind of
Restoring the soil kind of the microbiome
[SPEAKER_13]: in the soil approach towards prevention
and you know I've known Brian for a long
[SPEAKER_13]: time back when I used to work in
hydroponic industry and you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel very honored and blessed to you
know be working with vital and on this
[SPEAKER_13]: input review we're doing for this
third-party farm certification program
[SPEAKER_13]: we're doing in viral cabinets because you
know in this brave new world of You know
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticide regulations that are so tight,
you know, it's like there's just it's just
[SPEAKER_13]: such a Scary world of like what products
do I use because you know just four or
[SPEAKER_13]: five years ago people were unknowingly
using Bushmaster and gravity thinking it
[SPEAKER_13]: was derived from seaweed, you know,
and you know all these products,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, like Guardian that's getting it
got pulled for having unlisted avid in the
[SPEAKER_13]: product and like the most recent on
relisted as a troll, you know I'm real
[SPEAKER_13]: listed as an actor and kind of concentrate
from name which also turned out to have
[SPEAKER_13]: like three unlisted synthetic pyrethroids
and You know, it's like it's just this
[SPEAKER_13]: mind-blowing reality and there's you know,
the room for error of like a farmer
[SPEAKER_13]: knowing, you know, or having confidence in
a product, you know, that's going to help
[SPEAKER_13]: them succeed especially when they try to
do the right thing and maintain the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant's highest integrity, you know,
it's like looking to more and more to to
[SPEAKER_13]: you know quality products that are vetted
and you know actually going through some
[SPEAKER_13]: type of process to substantiate the
product I think is gonna be so important
[SPEAKER_13]: because yeah, I mean if people are you
know, it's like either drift is kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming from you know from neighboring
farms that where people are at they are in
[SPEAKER_13]: bad locations and just you know There's so
much chem chemi agriculture going on
[SPEAKER_13]: around them or you know and say,
you know using you know All these products
[SPEAKER_13]: in your closed-loop kind of organic system
that you know You don't necessarily know
[SPEAKER_13]: or should have the full trust in that
they're organic because you know
[SPEAKER_13]: oftentimes it's showing that they're
turning out to be hot, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: or You know the different products that
are sold.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Yeah, Brian man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a pleasure to talk to you Thank you
for your work man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody and my anyone could reach
out my email is Brian at vital garden
[SPEAKER_01]: supply comm I'd be stoked to connect with
all you guys out off air and just continue
[SPEAKER_01]: Making just cannabis industry cleaner and
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an Instagram that you want to
share?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah vital garden supply or at vital
garden supply We are active always putting
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that we're doing up and
work with a lot of great people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry super stoked on Alec and
SC labs and Tony's been doing incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: work and Bubble man, we've been using your
products and shoot as far back as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: remember Right on music way more insect
grass and thank you for being a leader and
[SPEAKER_02]: being leading by example because others
around you will see what you're doing and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll want to replicate it in other
counties to so great job SC and great job
[SPEAKER_02]: vital and Brian much love buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to see you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk soon mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming in Very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, we went solid there for a couple of
hours got pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the conversation I did just end up
sending the link out to forest who may or
[SPEAKER_07]: may not make it in he was watching said
the panel was wonderful and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: inspiring him he's kind of a big part of
the underlining conversation really of all
[SPEAKER_07]: of that we're talking about because really
let's be honest Where do we all want to
[SPEAKER_07]: align ourselves?
[SPEAKER_07]: with the highest of integrity with the
With no poisons with with things that
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't even questionable in any way
because yeah to do no harm, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our Hippocratic oath.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the cannabis community really
this core group right here I believe wants
[SPEAKER_07]: to do no harm and there's so many
different aspects of the community that we
[SPEAKER_07]: cover with each little box that's
currently residing in here right from the
[SPEAKER_07]: roots right up to the to the resin heads
and I want to give a shout out to Greece
[SPEAKER_02]: for legalizing medical cannabis and also
to Spain for Catalonia for the Barcelona
[SPEAKER_02]: area for legalizing consumption
cultivation and distribution Did you know
[SPEAKER_11]: that in the 1920s Greece was the largest
hashish producer for Europe I Had no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would have Wow must have been pretty
good hash I'd like to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_09]: Greece for Saganaki flaming cheese.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Right next to your table and they
bring it to you Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like doing dabs of cheese.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the best appetizer Oh cheese dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely see a Hulk meme coming up
Hulk Hulk do cheese dabs Hulk love fun do
[SPEAKER_11]: I collected about several hundred
different Lebanese cloth bags that were
[SPEAKER_11]: used for for Hashish because that's the
way the Lebanese produced it in like a
[SPEAKER_11]: linen cloth bag Do you have any do you
have any to show us?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can go get some in the other room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, just a couple hundred at yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No just What I was trying to say was I
wish I had one From the 20s and before
[SPEAKER_11]: what Lebanon was doing the exact same
thing in linen bags Yeah, I've seen some
[SPEAKER_07]: of your linen bags and every time you've
allowed me to look at them and touch them
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always like this is so cool Like what
a unique part of the history I've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard but never seen even when I
scored Lebanese it came in that very thick
[SPEAKER_02]: filmed cellophane it wasn't in the in
something like that, but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that they're even around or
collectible and that he of course has
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I Have most of the ones that exist
on the planet currently in one spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not to say he's got the corner Just
in the other room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be right back Make a suggestion to
Alec.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just an idea for when you see
Samples come by that are hot with
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides wouldn't be Really cool,
you know, they sell these little Packed
[SPEAKER_09]: cartridges with silica gel and what you
can do is basically do it just a quick
[SPEAKER_09]: flash filtration of that sample through
the silica gel and you know when you give
[SPEAKER_09]: the customer their bad news that their
sample is Contaminated you also can give
[SPEAKER_09]: them good news that they can basically
flash that shit through silica gel
[SPEAKER_09]: basically remove the Contamination and and
make it, you know good medicine again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're saying so you're saying that's a
successful like pesticide removal process.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean absolutely I mean most of the
pesticides at least again the Azoles will
[SPEAKER_09]: get hung up on So if they're there and
just trace amounts, I imagine that again I
[SPEAKER_09]: was thinking I'm really intrigued about
this hexane extraction of CBD but if you
[SPEAKER_09]: were to take a nonpolar Media and
basically run that through silica gel your
[SPEAKER_09]: your pesticide contamination should be
Polar enough that it gets hung up on the
[SPEAKER_09]: silica gel where the extract and all the
nonpolar components and the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_09]: and shit And so now you're providing your
your customer again with the bad news that
[SPEAKER_09]: their shit is coming back contaminated but
good news that they could basically just
[SPEAKER_09]: flash through a column of silica gel and
basically clean it up and then resubmit it
[SPEAKER_09]: and then see if it actually So here's a
question though when you say clean that up
[SPEAKER_07]: and say you're doing It regularly and
you're getting this what I would suppose
[SPEAKER_07]: is some toxic waste or something That is
very bad that you don't want to like what
[SPEAKER_07]: do you do with that stuff?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are people doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: It just gets hung up on the silica gel,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just yeah, basically get where does
the silica gel go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you throw it into a landfill?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it like I don't I don't understand
You sell it to the jello company and they
[SPEAKER_03]: start putting it in jello along with the
cow hooves Yeah, you know we still like it
[SPEAKER_03]: we use a silica gel filter Right
underneath the main chamber in our
[SPEAKER_03]: extractor to sequester the insecticides,
but those Gel filters come in a package
[SPEAKER_03]: that says that when you're done with it
You can put it back in the package and
[SPEAKER_03]: dispose of it at a place where they take
stuff like that So it's it's not like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna put it in jello or pudding or
send it to Bill Cosby You're getting out
[SPEAKER_09]: of the concentrate and at that point I
mean again they can Be incinerated where
[SPEAKER_09]: they get completely burned and you know,
I turned into co2 for the atmosphere But
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, whatever I mean, I'm not saying
that we have that problem solved I'm just
[SPEAKER_09]: saying that if you know again,
I always look at those, you know decisions
[SPEAKER_09]: where Vendors are looking to either,
you know buy a whole lot of material and
[SPEAKER_09]: then you know They're like having kind of
like what Tony was saying somewhat of an
[SPEAKER_09]: interview with the grower with the
supplier to understand, you know That the
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff is pesticide free even if they do
see results Maybe they got results on one
[SPEAKER_09]: bag, but they're buying 20 bags How did he
know that the result from the one bag is
[SPEAKER_09]: representative?
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if you're talking about
microbiological contamination,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a whole different issue but I was
just just referring to pesticide
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination in particular, which is that
Again, you can sample one part of the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant that has pesticide contamination
other parts of that same plant could be
[SPEAKER_09]: completely Nated so how you sample a large
batch of material to get a representative
[SPEAKER_09]: sample so when you're looking to make you
know a purchase of you know several a Lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of material that you could actually have a
reasonable You know idea that that
[SPEAKER_09]: material is not contaminated But again,
I'll go back to one last thing and then
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll shut up which is when you're looking
at the PBB Level the part per billion
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna find fucking everything dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna find Viagra You're gonna find
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna find everything that's
ubiquitous in our environment at that
[SPEAKER_09]: level which Unfortunately is all our
names.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying that cocaine and Viagra are
ubiquitous in your environment mark?
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends on the region or this municipal
water supply you're dipping from Ah,
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a friend who's got a triple quad
mass spec that you can roll out any large
[SPEAKER_09]: bill in front of that Triple quad and it's
got a sniffer that will find the cocaine
[SPEAKER_09]: on just about any bill that comes from
anyone's pocket No matter if it was used
[SPEAKER_09]: for coke or not Looking apart per billion
level again, you're finding things that
[SPEAKER_09]: are really you know Equitous within our
environment Alec.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you agree?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean Part per million is one thing right
does everyone understand what when we say
[SPEAKER_09]: part per billion part So there's there's
percent right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part per hundred then there's part
per thousand, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's even small then there's part per
million now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking part per billion,
man That's just very very so it's like a
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah That's like a one shot of removed
inside a railroad car full of gin in terms
[SPEAKER_09]: of a dry Martin So I mean the fact is is
that the dilution of these things in the
[SPEAKER_09]: environment and the sensitivity of these
instruments I mean again, can you run
[SPEAKER_09]: whole foods produce?
[SPEAKER_09]: through the same level of scrutiny and not
find Trace amounts of some of these
[SPEAKER_09]: insecticides and plant regulators Art per
billion level, you know, so I think I
[SPEAKER_13]: think you bring up really interesting like
conundrum you know and and You know,
[SPEAKER_13]: they kind of reminds me if you're familiar
with Michael Pollan's work botany of
[SPEAKER_13]: desire, you know and in the button desire
He takes these, you know for crops can
[SPEAKER_09]: several Like about ten episodes of hash
church it always comes awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's amazing It's so amazing and it
gives me such future hope for a humanity
[SPEAKER_13]: honestly beyond like all the political
bullshit of this, you know, just the whole
[SPEAKER_13]: coevolution thing and how much Who's
really in the driver's seat?
[SPEAKER_13]: How much effect is this kind of cannabis
plant having effect on our personal
[SPEAKER_13]: cultural evolution and the industries that
are being created from it and the
[SPEAKER_13]: awareness that's being, you know kind of
brought up, you know to you know to to
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody that's you know working with
this plant, you know, and it's fascinating
[SPEAKER_13]: because in you know, but his are he
believes in the future hope his future
[SPEAKER_13]: hope for you know, kind of the coming,
you know, kind of global food commodity
[SPEAKER_13]: market and like, you know kind of the
shifting to this slow food movement farm
[SPEAKER_13]: fresh local produce model You know in so
many ways, you know You know can give us
[SPEAKER_13]: props to the cannabis farmers because of
how intensively we focus on a perfect
[SPEAKER_13]: growing this plant optimally for the most
resin for all these things and you know
[SPEAKER_13]: doing it organically without any
pesticides all the stuff and and and you
[SPEAKER_13]: know regulations it's really interesting
because you know, it's you know
[SPEAKER_13]: regulations around cannabis specifically
on pesticides, you know, I almost think
[SPEAKER_13]: it's like the cannabis plant is almost
gonna Shake a lot of people that aren't
[SPEAKER_13]: really in line with the integrity of its
message off, you know real quickly because
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, it's like, you know,
if so many people coming in with so much
[SPEAKER_13]: money think they're gonna come just crush
it, you know, and like buy all these,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know old cut flower greenhouses that
have so con you're so dirty soil like,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the my point is the pesticide
regulations of cannabis I think are gonna
[SPEAKER_13]: expose the dirty dirty secret about how
ubiquitous pesticides are in our
[SPEAKER_13]: environment and how you know a zero is
almost a really difficult thing to ever
[SPEAKER_13]: produce again because of how much spraying
and how much contamination has taken
[SPEAKER_13]: place, you know, and I'm really hoping
deeply that you know kind of the ethics of
[SPEAKER_13]: the the leaders in the cannabis movement
and in in kind of you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: dedicating and doubling down to that's you
know, knowing the farmer and you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: you're anti monocrop, you know,
kind of being able to kind of have you
[SPEAKER_13]: know, you know tighter understandings and
controls over the supply chain management
[SPEAKER_13]: of like where you're getting bud that's
making products that you're trying to put
[SPEAKER_13]: under your brand, you know, I think it's
it's you know, it's the biggest topic in
[SPEAKER_13]: the industry I think and and I think it's
gonna you know, in so many ways highlight,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the in the global agricultural
movement, it's going to bring up the
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticide issue to people's consciousness
and and hopefully in some bit of a way it
[SPEAKER_13]: really does begin to you know,
shift or accelerate kind of just you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: awareness around slow food movement and
you know, kind of yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: we supply a lot of our product to multiple
sustainable agriculture consultants in the
[SPEAKER_12]: conventionally produced commodity industry
where they're growing tomatoes and stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: like that and one of the the the larger
clients that some of my guys sell to is
[SPEAKER_12]: well, these are independent distributors
that are selling to large agricultural
[SPEAKER_12]: operations.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that some of these
larger producers are doing is they're
[SPEAKER_12]: actually using systemic fungicides once
per week, whether the crop needs it or not
[SPEAKER_12]: like on tomatoes, they'll go ahead and put
down so you know, we're privileged to some
[SPEAKER_12]: of these protocols that these guys are
doing and so what will end up happening is
[SPEAKER_12]: they they use contact fungicides but
they're also using systemics once a week
[SPEAKER_12]: and you know, whether the plant needs it
or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's horrifying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's what's what systemics do you
know what they're using exactly?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know all of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's there's a multitude.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's there's there's quite a few but
rather than get into the the details of
[SPEAKER_12]: the actual chemical compounds,
which I think will bore people,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this will kind of be more of
interest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So so the these the systemics,
what they're doing is they're actually
[SPEAKER_12]: encumbering the vascular system of the
tomato.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you go into, you know, a major
retail store, and you see a tomato that's
[SPEAKER_12]: grown there, like back when we were kids,
you would see those little brown spots
[SPEAKER_12]: that the tomato would get.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now those little brown spots that the
tomato get, which is which is botrytis,
[SPEAKER_12]: the tomatoes don't get those anymore,
because again, they're using a proactive
[SPEAKER_12]: approach.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, those systemic fungicides,
again, we're talking about micro doses.
[SPEAKER_12]: So think about this this systemic
fungicide that's going into a tomato on a
[SPEAKER_12]: part per million basis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So so that systemic is actually killing
all of its it's working as a biocide.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's killing all of the bacteria,
good and bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now like antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What chemical are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: So on a part basis, what's happening is,
when you eat, you know, a fruit or a
[SPEAKER_12]: vegetable, what what could happen,
and again, this is being disclosed to me,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying this is fact or truth.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that, that systemic fungicide that is
penetrating the entire vascular system of
[SPEAKER_12]: that tomato is is working as like an
antibiotic within our microbiome in our
[SPEAKER_12]: digestive disease.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what's being told to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's horrifying.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not something that I'm disclosing on
the basis of our company.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just what some of our sustainable
agriculture consultants have disclosed to
[SPEAKER_12]: me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to get that straight.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you think about the rise in gluten
intolerance, you think about the rise in
[SPEAKER_12]: celiac disease, autoimmune disease,
disease.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you think about the fact that possibly
a fungicide that's designed to kill
[SPEAKER_09]: bacteria is you know, a fungicide is
designed to kill fungus, a bactericide is
[SPEAKER_09]: designed to kill bacteria, and they're not
necessarily in the same bucket.
[SPEAKER_09]: Antimicrobials in general, there are broad
classes of antimicrobials.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some kill fungus, some kill bugs,
some kill both, some kill one to kill the
[SPEAKER_09]: other because it creates a biofilm and the
biofilm becomes basically a zoo for a
[SPEAKER_09]: whole diverse population of new microbes
that basically colonize the people who
[SPEAKER_09]: came in there before them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's, and I'm really interested in
what you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what you're telling me is that,
and again, I'm somewhat of an expert in
[SPEAKER_09]: this field of antimicrobials.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make sure you're not being
bullshitted, which is that systemic
[SPEAKER_09]: fungicides are put into the plant not to
kill bacteria, it's to kill fungus,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the systemic fungicides that I know
that are used basically control fungi on
[SPEAKER_09]: the plant and in the soil, but are very,
very short lived.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're not there for a whole
long period of time.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you're telling me is that there are
things that are being applied to tomatoes
[SPEAKER_09]: that are persistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what was disclosed to me,
Mark, but I'll tell you what is the active
[SPEAKER_09]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just curious because that active
ingredient must be registered for human
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption because if it's persistent in
tomatoes, that means you can eat a tomato
[SPEAKER_09]: that has some level of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that means that some company
registered a whole bunch of products based
[SPEAKER_09]: on some safety data that said that a whole
bunch of human beings can eat this shit
[SPEAKER_09]: with this level of this stuff in these
tomatoes or else it wouldn't be on the U S
[SPEAKER_09]: market, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's supposedly those limits.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're probably right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what this gentleman told me,
and again, I'm not publicly disclosing it
[SPEAKER_12]: on behalf of our company.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just being told that these biosides,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_12]: These biosides can actually eliminate a
lot of the bacteria as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they work as a biocide, not necessarily
just a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're destroying all of the bacteria
like an antibiotic would essentially.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So broad spectrum and again, broad
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_09]: So any microbial, it's a biocide.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely something that they're not
being specific on whether it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: fungicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most biosides, there are certain,
again, ones that basically have no
[SPEAKER_09]: activity against fungi at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fungi have their own, they got their own
fucking kingdom, I think, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to add one thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a whole lot of chemicals
that are used in the production of food
[SPEAKER_09]: and processed food and produce.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what makes it registered today is not
necessarily chemicals that kill bugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of chemicals that kill bugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes a crop protection agent
register today is the fact that it has a
[SPEAKER_09]: really good safety profile, is that it's
got no mammalian toxicity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of the mode of actions of new low
use rate agrochemicals are based on
[SPEAKER_09]: specific action that are specific to
insects.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like calcium channeling and potassium
channels, there's specific mechanisms in
[SPEAKER_09]: insects that don't exist in humans,
so they can develop essentially medicines,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you will, just to basically knock those
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me just finish this last thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the point is, is that those are used in
foods today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere a long time ago, or maybe not so
long ago, a company spent a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: money in doing safety and assessment
studies to get that stuff registered for
[SPEAKER_09]: that end use.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, here in Canada, we're faced
with the conundrum that there is no safety
[SPEAKER_09]: assessment for any of these products being
applied to cannabis, because no company
[SPEAKER_09]: was forced to do that, to register the
active ingredients so they can sell
[SPEAKER_09]: products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like the dipshit that Trump
put in there is going to basically keep
[SPEAKER_09]: companies from being able to register
stuff with the EPA, which is completely
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Trump voters.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing is, is that there are
biological ways of controlling plant
[SPEAKER_09]: disease that can aid cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is really the EPA taking two steps
backwards in not registering those
[SPEAKER_12]: products.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, did you read the letter that Scott
Pruitt wrote on this?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so shallow and so thin.
[SPEAKER_09]: The EPA can't do this because cannabis is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a fucking bullshit letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, all this talk of pesticides is a
bit of a downer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we do need to have safety
standards.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do need to produce clean, safe
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: What that letter shows, Sam, is that,
oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What that letter shows is that,
you know, they're not taking a step
[SPEAKER_09]: forward in letting... I agree with you,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: I read the letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it just, yeah, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your show and tell now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see the red is a triple S.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's green as a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're messing with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm afraid the light is very poor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of see.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is for the kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, you're funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's called kitty ash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a character.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I agree, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's definitely, especially with
the level of the people that are in here
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, even Brian who just left,
a lot of the people really, most of us
[SPEAKER_07]: here are at the point where we much prefer
to just have product, not have to become
[SPEAKER_07]: sick and have these poisons used on them,
but a product that could be bred
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically for strength and for
resilience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Used with proper root symbiosis and living
soils and teas and organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to see the plant in the most
natural of ways be boosted to express its
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene and cannabinoid profile back to
the 10, because I really feel like we're
[SPEAKER_07]: living in the age of the seven right now
where everyone thinks a seven is like a
[SPEAKER_07]: 9.5 and it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to add, think about what
Alex said though.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is totally fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole pesticide issue, which they
want to have cannabis with zero
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is rising to the level of
awareness where people are beginning to
[SPEAKER_09]: think about how this affects their food.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like, hey, how is the food that I'm
eating raised?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this botrytis free tomato the safest
thing I could be eating?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got whole bags from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus I have where I just cut out the
design on a bunch of bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Sam, are those hemp?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that woven out of hemp?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, these are probably either cotton or
linen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the lady with the big rifle that
you could tell by just how she- AK-47
[SPEAKER_11]: pick, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's definitely what's from the
70s or something like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have Two Horses brand and there's
Christian ones and there's Muslim ones
[SPEAKER_11]: because they were both in the hash trade.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer of the nations.
Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great collection of history there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I even have one paper one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the paper one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss normal hashish?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. normal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guaranteed Mrs. normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, welcome, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've been talking about all
sorts of things, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got to step in and listen to
some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really glad to hear the systemic
pesticide discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to send you that message and tell
you thanks, but thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, no matter how safe we
think they are, let's probably not put
[SPEAKER_07]: them into everything we eat and inhale
into our lungs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had, I don't know if it got
brought up or not, but we had 40% of our
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines once we made concentrates,
40% of them failed for mycoputinol from
[SPEAKER_04]: organic farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been really making a big issue
about this and I haven't heard it talked
[SPEAKER_04]: much anywhere, which is why I love,
love this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the level?
[SPEAKER_13]: And especially, especially with the Eagle
21 of the really trippy parts is,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, since it's at such a similar
boiling point as cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_13]: when it's distilled, it's so common,
concentrated absolutely with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, you know, as opposed to other things
that might not be.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I really wonder if we're talking
about systemic fungicides is, and maybe
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark would know about this, but are they,
are they selective?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when you're talking about the
diminishing titters of fungi within the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant's vascular system, is that
particular synthetic capable of being
[SPEAKER_12]: selective in what it kills?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, will it, are you sure,
Mark, that these products, and I've
[SPEAKER_12]: studied them great, but do you mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but I think it's safe to say that
the green revolution model of monocrop
[SPEAKER_13]: super chemi agriculture with dumping
pesticides disproportionately on your
[SPEAKER_13]: plants, you know, you know, without any
regard, you know, as always to the edge of
[SPEAKER_13]: such incredible, you know, loss of soil
microbiome, you know, and so, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's, it might be all things
combined, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and, you know, and because,
because, yeah, if you kill off the fungus
[SPEAKER_13]: in the soil and you, you, you allow an
environment for certain bacterial colonies
[SPEAKER_13]: to grow disproportionately, and you don't,
you lose your balance of protozoa and
[SPEAKER_13]: nematodes, bacteria to fungus.
[SPEAKER_13]: You also, you significantly throw off the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and then, yeah, and when you're
just continuously dumping, like,
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever chemicals, I mean, it seems like
they're obviously, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: have you heard about the Indian farmers
that have killed themselves drinking
[SPEAKER_13]: Monsanto fertilizers over the last 10
years by the 100,000s, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: because of how quickly like the soil
erosion happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, like their, you know,
lot loss of natural soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys heard anything about that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but forest, they have no,
they think they have no future anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they drink the Monsanto side
themselves, because it's the cheapest way
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also because they become almost
indentured servitudes to big ag,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, in like, you know, the loans
that they then get so far behind on that
[SPEAKER_13]: they can't even ever pay back and have to
use increased, you know, kind of chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: fertilizers that they didn't have to buy
just to get the same sustained yields
[SPEAKER_13]: because their soil is dead now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the end, in the end,
what Monsanto and the other companies are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing there is they, they do make them
into indentured service that first,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then later they actually try to get
ahold of the land and they can run these
[SPEAKER_03]: guys off of their land because of the way
the laws and financial responsibility work
[SPEAKER_03]: in India.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's all, that's why I think that
the regulations on cannabis pesticide use
[SPEAKER_13]: are going to be, you know, actually so
good for the plants survival and for the
[SPEAKER_13]: survival of all the mom and pop,
mom and pop, small scale farmers have been
[SPEAKER_13]: doing this all their life, you know,
because it's so hard to grow especially on
[SPEAKER_13]: scale, really amazing quality cannabis
super turped up.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's clean without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you haven't like gotten smashed by
broad mites or russets, or like don't know
[SPEAKER_13]: how to deal with identifying all these
different plant pathogens and plant pests
[SPEAKER_13]: that are invasive is like, you're,
you know, the room for error, where you
[SPEAKER_13]: can like, not know how to diagnose it and
just bomb shit was like the triad of eagle
[SPEAKER_13]: forbid floor might those days are gone,
you know, and and I think I think the
[SPEAKER_13]: room, the margin for error and not knowing
how to have a really strong integrated
[SPEAKER_13]: pest management program, you know,
is going away real quick.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like, I think the people that have
figured it out are going to be super
[SPEAKER_13]: successful while a lot of people fail,
you know, because a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_13]: throwing huge money and building most
sophisticated build outs, thinking that
[SPEAKER_13]: they're just going to crush and become
like the biggest cannabis millionaires
[SPEAKER_13]: ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's like, it's, it's interesting,
because it's like, this is very different
[SPEAKER_13]: playing field, because the pesticide thing
is, I guess, I think it'll be one of the
[SPEAKER_13]: single dividing factors and who makes it
who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you got to admit, if you look at
the food supply in America, the vast
[SPEAKER_11]: majority of it is not organic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But but you know, that's also why on like
oncology doctors and and like autism
[SPEAKER_13]: specialists, like always first and
foremost, get parents to not or to choose
[SPEAKER_13]: organic foods and produce for the kids
because of the presence of all these
[SPEAKER_13]: random endocrine disrupting different
types of like, you know, kind of gnarly
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of, you know, neuro toxic pesticides,
you know, and then also like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: considering like, omidacloprid,
you know, omidacloprid neonicotinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticide is one of the most frequently
used common accepted acknowledged,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, pesticides on, you know,
most produce, you know, nationally,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's also one of the biggest
contributors to the calling collapse
[SPEAKER_13]: disorder and mass beat off that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the biggest and which is one of
the biggest reasons why California went
[SPEAKER_13]: so, you know, kind of regulated,
even though omidacloprid is, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: regulated for use on tobacco, it's not
going to be for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in California that was super strict on
it, especially because of like how much
[SPEAKER_13]: California is trying to remove
neonicotinoids from, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of the supply chain, you know,
or just from, you know, the agricultural
[SPEAKER_13]: use, you know, so it's like, yeah,
there's so many pesticides approved by the
[SPEAKER_13]: EPA.
[SPEAKER_13]: But does that actually mean that,
you know, we're not getting harmed or
[SPEAKER_13]: chronically from the exposure to all these
different you know, whatever high
[SPEAKER_13]: chemicals we introduce to our bodies every
day?
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly don't think the average
American gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, why do they eat it?
[SPEAKER_11]: We do though.
[SPEAKER_11]: And why do they buy all their food from,
you know, places that are manufacturing
[SPEAKER_11]: with pesticides?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they like the cheap prices.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: But also it's, you know, hopefully that,
you know, there, I mean, there's this very
[SPEAKER_13]: interesting, you know, kind of oxymoron,
or I don't know if that's even the right
[SPEAKER_13]: word.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, yeah, you have so many
people buying, you know, $100 grams of
[SPEAKER_13]: extracts and just trolling people
relentlessly on Instagram about having
[SPEAKER_13]: dirty product for like residual butane or
pesticides, even though yeah, they're
[SPEAKER_13]: going to McDonald's and eating a Big Mac
after that three times a day, three times
[SPEAKER_13]: a day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, there's obviously a disconnect
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think, you know, hopefully,
you know, this educates makes us aware,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know, pushes us to change our
ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the old meme about the hippie girl
at the fish show or the dead show who only
[SPEAKER_04]: eats organic and vegan but is taking the
mystery, the mystery liquid in the parking
[SPEAKER_04]: lot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Won't drink cow's milk, take acid from
strangers.
[SPEAKER_08]: LSD is medicine though.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, but it's still a funny meme.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone asked how much that I happen to
have my recent stack of test results here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you out there,
if you want to have clean and do clean
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine, that's what it takes is testing
everything over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just went through this real quickly
to see if I had any fails in this stack
[SPEAKER_04]: that I have here of recent tests,
probably about 30 or 40 tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I pulled out three that came up really
quick from organic farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the mic, let's see, this one's got
Michael butanol, 2.1 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_04]: carbaryl, 20.3 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you say this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tabucazole?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tabucazole?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tabucazole.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we got experts on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 0.2 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one popped up quite a bit from a
farm in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an organic farm, apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So carbaryl's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one pops up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a stake in this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that like an organophosphate that's
used in eggs?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: At those levels, would you think that that
could still be not coming from a foliar
[SPEAKER_09]: application and it could be coming from
say like a mulch or a, not a mulch,
[SPEAKER_09]: what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_13]: Dirty inputs, yeah, hot inputs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like dirty soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Could this be a dirty soil or a drift and
not necessarily, hey, I never applied that
[SPEAKER_09]: material to my plants at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of these folks,
sorry, not to jump in, but just with our
[SPEAKER_04]: organization, because we're dealing with
such fragile and small children,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't just take whatever somebody wants
to donate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to get to know these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these folks I know,
it's an uncomfortable situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that Tony's had this as well,
or some of you have, when you have to go
[SPEAKER_04]: back and say, hey, sorry, you know,
we had to destroy this or not use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get pretty upset because people
put their life's work and passion into
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know some of these people are not
intentionally contaminated, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was personally the guy, I was kind of
like the Grinch of Chalice, because part
[SPEAKER_13]: of my job was to basically contact the 79
disqualified entrants that had pesticides
[SPEAKER_13]: in their products.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was basically letting them know that
they were disqualified because these
[SPEAKER_13]: detected pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, people are super pissed.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's like, one of the big things I was
focusing on, like with all these people I
[SPEAKER_13]: was talking to is I was like, you know,
man, I mean, this is honestly,
[SPEAKER_13]: although you lost $500 per entry,
you know, entry fee, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's such a small price to pay to figure
this out right now, where you still have a
[SPEAKER_13]: few months to get way ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if you don't, you're done.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, it's almost too late to
figure how it's like, if you're finding
[SPEAKER_13]: out right now, that you have you've never
cleaned out your closed loop system,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and you're sourcing from all
these farms or all this material,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and your pesticides in the same
concentrations across the 10 samples that
[SPEAKER_13]: were entered, it's like that's so such
clear cross contamination in your
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction machine or in your gas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, and so just people coming to
wear this right now, it's like a small
[SPEAKER_13]: price to pay to get publicly humiliated in
this, you know, in one of these,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, events and competitions,
because you know, six months from now,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a quarter million dollar product
recall, or a liability lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you don't test your your race car on
race day.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't test your car.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also to some of these really persistent
and systemic insecticides, pesticides,
[SPEAKER_11]: fungicides, they get into the soil,
and they persist there for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, because it's like,
you know, if a foliar applications
[SPEAKER_13]: applied, and then you'd be from the sun is
the biggest thing breaking down the
[SPEAKER_13]: systemic residue.
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens when you're root drenching
amid a clover or root drenching any of
[SPEAKER_13]: these other compounds?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, because what is the half life or
the residue effect there?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I would, yeah, I would totally
agree that it's probably the biology,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you have good biology in the soil,
they'll actually bind to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_12]: synthetic hydrocarbons that are in the
soil and bind it to the the the soil,
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of like, like bioremediation.
[SPEAKER_09]: The microbes will actually degrade some of
these actives, because again, the actives
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't necessarily antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these insecticides, again,
will have no activity on the microbes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the microbes sees that carbon,
it's going to eat it like there's no
[SPEAKER_09]: tomorrow, as though it's sugar,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, a lot of a lot of chemicals rely
on microbial degradation to make sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not persistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Microbial, photolytic, hydrolytic,
these are all the, you know, reactive
[SPEAKER_09]: handles that they put into these active
ingredients, so they don't persist in the
[SPEAKER_09]: environment like the old ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to give a big shout out to
the vegetarians out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You folks do realize that all the white
sugar produced, it goes through activated
[SPEAKER_11]: bone charcoal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man first jello and now this, huh?
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, real quick about something
I wanted to kind of share a story on.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my really good friends,
you know, he grew for a long time in Santa
[SPEAKER_13]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: His family has a lot of pear orchards up
or, you know, massive acreage of pear
[SPEAKER_13]: orchard up in northern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, he's an organic certified
pear farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: But and so so so they, you know,
dedicated organic and such, they go up
[SPEAKER_13]: there, they get your two plus license,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they, you know, have over 44,000 for a
few greenhouse going now, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: but they've run into a major problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's that, you know, pretty much all
the all the surrounding farms in the in
[SPEAKER_13]: that valley, all are also pear orchards
are not organic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and when they when they spray for
pesticides, they basically have like a
[SPEAKER_13]: like a metal pipe grid.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of going around the entire orchard
with like kind of holes kind of throughout
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, they charge the line and just
shoots like 20, 30 feet into the air.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, these, you know, this,
you know, water kind of with diluted
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticide or fungicide in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and, you know, there's all these these
these, you know, rules for when these
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticides are allowed to be applied,
like no wind, you know, certain times of
[SPEAKER_13]: the day or night, you know, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: But he's pretty much already had to
threaten lawsuits to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_13]: neighboring farms.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the valley, you know, to be because of
how, how regulated cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_13]: is, you know, that they have to be
notified with x amount of time,
[SPEAKER_13]: so they can basically batter down the
hatches of all the greenhouses and then F
[SPEAKER_13]: attempts when they're spraying to like
prevent any drift coming in their
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, they've already,
although not detected in the flower,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, once they made, you know,
kind of their products, that's all organic
[SPEAKER_13]: and extract, they're they're seeing this
consistent like detectable level of like a
[SPEAKER_13]: fungicide called Bosco lit Bosco lit.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the pesticides that Oregon and
California have on their list.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a fungicide that's used on pears
quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, just kind of,
you know, considering kind of how how kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of drift travels, you know, and,
you know, when you don't have like
[SPEAKER_13]: positive displacement or kind of,
you know, what have you, it's like,
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, is a lot of people like when you
think about, you know, all these huge
[SPEAKER_13]: acquisitions of all these old kind of,
you know, kind of cut flower farm
[SPEAKER_13]: greenhouses throughout Monterey and
Salinas is like, I mean, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: holy shit, there might be it might be
shown that a lot of areas can't grow herb
[SPEAKER_13]: that is in compliance with what the state
requirements and limits pesticides are
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least in greenhouses, the pesticide is
a bit contained.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's worse is when they're growing
strawberries and other outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just airplanes to spray those and I
guarantee you it drips.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know how they use the plastic on
the strawberries?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, one, they were using methyl bromide
back then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't use it on grapes.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were injecting the methyl bromide to
strawberry fields that were in kind of a
[SPEAKER_12]: residential neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_12]: The wind came and blew that plastic tarp
off for weed control that actually
[SPEAKER_12]: sustains the the the gas within the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: The tarp came off and they had to evacuate
four blocks of houses.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of this methyl bromide that was
used on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I grew up in the Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the Central Valley in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there's no containing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those cropped us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to play as kids next to some of
those fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because we rented houses there growing
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember they'd start spraying,
you know, 20 yards before the field and we
[SPEAKER_04]: would just get dosed in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's it's just a sloppy
application and it's really going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that dosage while you were as a
kid had anything to do with what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: on with your kid now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's where I got my superpowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's just you just bathe in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to follow the mosquito truck down
my back lane while it was spraying Zyklon
[SPEAKER_07]: B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just playing in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, oh, they got me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do the same thing following a
mosquito truck when I lived in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ride my bicycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I follow it on my bike too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people like sniffing gasoline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in Okinawa and the mosquito
trucks drove around spraying DDT all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as kids, we rode behind it in bicycles
because it was the only mosquito free zone
[SPEAKER_03]: we could find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: True story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're all going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to steer it back to how cannabis
can flourish in scenarios where pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungicide isn't really needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, you know, this plant evolved
without our interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think there's a thing with
soil biology and also identification of
[SPEAKER_00]: the types that grow in these different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, indoor and in greenhouses,
to an extent, you can create different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, you're kind of limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an incredibly diverse gene
pool that we've created at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, it's been my experience and
I really want to push the idea that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the right cultivars and the right
attention to the soil or the biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever material you're growing in,
including indoors and greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find plants that will give you
what you're seeking and not have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: any applications of any of these things
that we've been discussing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really pushing this idea because
one, Alec was mentioning that small farms
[SPEAKER_00]: have an advantage here that large farms
aren't going to be able to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: because at a small farm, you can source
your inputs yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control what your compost is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control what your biology is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make friends with your neighbors
so that they're not spraying on your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been my experience, I'll say it
like that, that I've had some success
[SPEAKER_00]: finding plants that flourish in the
environment I can offer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to suggest to anyone that cares
to explore the different plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, you can probably find something
that's going to give you what you want in
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment you're working with and
you're going to find it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need all these things that we've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I find a plant that I really
love, and it isn't challenged by bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, insect frass is one of the
routine supplements that I use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also like certain plant-based
amendments that I can use in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like comfrey, stinging nettle,
and horsetail makes a tea that irritates
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, but doesn't seem to really be a
pesticide per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times, plants seem to be really
stimulated and like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the only foliar sprays that I use
is water, especially adjusting the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard Mike, there's been
discussion here about using electrolysis
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, foliar spray of water really has
remarkable effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you spray water, is it at a specific
time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, I know you don't really want
to do it when the sun is high in the sky
[SPEAKER_07]: and burning hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if I'm indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right when the lights come on or just
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to do it as the lights go
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, again, just following that same
thing in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the stomatae on the leaves open up,
it's a real good time to give them some
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, rinse the dust off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take in some moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the guiding principle about
how I work with plants is to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what nature is like for those
plants, where they come from, and then try
[SPEAKER_00]: and duplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because the plant,
the genetic pool that we've created is so
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse, I really think that whatever
conditions you're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find plants that will flourish in
your scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, this
conversation's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about various things to control pests
or keep diseases in check are not so
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant, it's incredible what this
plant is capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all, every one of us has some
aspect of deep respect for what this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can do for us humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do think that we have evolved
with this plant to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has evolved to benefit us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Pollan definitely hints at that in
his book, The Botany of Desire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm in agreeance with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great companion we have both been
to one another, cannabis and humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like the dog of the plant
world, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a very successful plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's our companion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a co-evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the teaming with microbes approach,
whenever you're looking to nature for a
[SPEAKER_13]: more efficient design, and you're able to
as close to potentially possible recreate
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know people that are having such
amazing success, especially on big scale
[SPEAKER_13]: production, working with and teaming with
predatory mites, persimilis and swarovski
[SPEAKER_13]: mites, and just having this very
methodical, never deviating from the
[SPEAKER_13]: preventative approach, the whole ounce of
preventions or the pound of cure,
[SPEAKER_13]: and using different rotational
horticultural oils and biofungicides and
[SPEAKER_13]: bioinsecticides and compost teas.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just amazing because that's
the leading possible potential way to grow
[SPEAKER_13]: a plant to maximize ability with maximized
increases in secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so funny and amazing that
cannabis farmers have figured out how to
[SPEAKER_13]: become, if they choose the path,
the best farmers that are possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so yeah, I really hope and have a lot
of faith that that's going to carry over
[SPEAKER_13]: and hopefully empower through hemp
production, a lot of other farms who might
[SPEAKER_13]: have been growing GMO corn up to this
point.
[SPEAKER_13]: But hopefully, it's the thing that is
catalyst to help shift.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck with corn.
[SPEAKER_11]: 90% of it's GMO.
[SPEAKER_12]: 94.
[SPEAKER_12]: The economic model that drives the
cannabis industry right now is based on
[SPEAKER_12]: quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, our food is not that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most Americans right now don't give a shit
about the nutrient density within the
[SPEAKER_12]: commodity that they're ingesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about price.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're not even seeing the
hypocrisy of what Alec just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_07]: spending days trolling people relentlessly
for their dirty extracts while just
[SPEAKER_07]: consuming the lowest quality of food known
to man.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're making me want to go get one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what's important here is the
preventative.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you got clean, certified genetics,
you started to grow, and you took all of
[SPEAKER_10]: these best practices that's being
discussed today between Wade and our buddy
[SPEAKER_10]: there, Kyn Roots, with his product.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're doing everything you could
possibly do to give the plant its most
[SPEAKER_10]: healthy environment and its best potential
to be as strong as it can be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has exposure to UV in the sun in
some capacity.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to naturally ward off pests and
PM and things like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, that's what the bottom line
here is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like a systems approach,
a systems approach towards how you manage
[SPEAKER_13]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called IPM.
[SPEAKER_13]: And prevention is the key.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also considering too, it's really
interesting because when I used to work in
[SPEAKER_13]: the hydroponic stores in Santa Cruz,
one of the most frequent things I would
[SPEAKER_13]: see happen is people would essentially cut
corners on build out or dehumidification,
[SPEAKER_13]: say, and then like they'll go overboard
and get like the full 20 part kind of,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, nutrient, kind of, you know,
PGR is everything to, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: almost overcompensate with their nutrients
for a shitty environment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, 80% success in so many ways
comes to the environment that's there that
[SPEAKER_13]: you created.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, when you consider like light
deprive, light like the private herb,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, most people and I think we
talked about this on on our church before,
[SPEAKER_13]: but you know, when you take a blackout
tarp and you cover up like a row of plants
[SPEAKER_13]: that you're light depping, you know,
you create this micro, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_13]: putting a clone, a clone trade dome on to
create 100% humidity, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: so for the whole night, you know,
you'll have this like shifts in humidity
[SPEAKER_13]: to where it sits at 70 to 80% for the rest
of the night.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's like perfect proliferative
environment for these microbes and powdery
[SPEAKER_13]: mildew and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what that's what you can easily
control.
[SPEAKER_11]: Humidity in the dark in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done it for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But how many people I mean, and you know,
and I think it's a part of people's own
[SPEAKER_13]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like understanding how much the
environment that you create is also one of
[SPEAKER_13]: the biggest things you could do to like
prevent pests and pathology, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: then using prevention like sprays from the
time the plants are small to where you can
[SPEAKER_13]: get full plant coverage with neem or
peppermint oil, you know, by the time
[SPEAKER_13]: they're huge, you're just doing your
weekly sprays.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even though you might not cover every
underside, every topside, every single
[SPEAKER_13]: leaf, you know, since you've been doing
methodically every week since the plant
[SPEAKER_13]: was a baby.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, you're pretty
contained, you know, but that's such a
[SPEAKER_13]: body of knowledge and work and dedication
devotion.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many people like that are scaling
1000%.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, it's like,
you know, it's just, it's hard to maintain
[SPEAKER_13]: a really integrity based IPM strategy,
you know, whenever you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: overextended or you don't have enough
staff because you know, it's always been,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, you can handle so much more
canopy space.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many less employees because you
spray these pesticides, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: financing your operation and you need to
protect your crop and you have proven
[SPEAKER_12]: methodologies that are going to do exactly
what you're talking about, Alec.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the caveats in this industry
as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: The economics, you know, it definitely
cost more to use IPM.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the largest biological control
person in Europe for years and years on
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you very much for that,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have deep respect, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam, I'm sorry, you didn't have,
you were, did you, is hemp disease pest
[SPEAKER_13]: management, that's McParland, correct?
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, what was that question?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit quiet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, hemp disease pest management,
was that McParland?
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have a part of that to do with
that work?
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the, the practical suggestions were
from me.
[SPEAKER_11]: John did research in libraries.
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert took photographs and I wrote the,
all the how to use the materials and what
[SPEAKER_11]: works and what doesn't because I've got 40
years experience using IPM.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's still to this day is like the
guideline textbook kind of in the subject.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your work.
[SPEAKER_11]: My goal at that time was specifically to
allow people to have alternatives to
[SPEAKER_11]: dangerous pesticides and sexicides,
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope it helped, but yeah,
to be honest, people almost have to be
[SPEAKER_11]: driven into using IPM.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not enough people have a good enough
conscience and they just not like,
[SPEAKER_11]: they prefer to save time save money and do
it the easy way, which is nuke them with
[SPEAKER_11]: some sort of nasty shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and also because usually whenever
somebody is going at a hydro store too,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, it's like, even though,
you know, the products you recommend is
[SPEAKER_13]: like, oh, you're in week two or three of
flower, you actually shouldn't really
[SPEAKER_13]: spray anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you are going to spray something
here, these organic products that you can
[SPEAKER_13]: spray, if you do, if you spend 30 hours in
your room, just spray and coat every
[SPEAKER_13]: plant, you know, but it's like,
by the time so many people are coming into
[SPEAKER_13]: the hydro stores to try to find a
solution, it's because they have a deep
[SPEAKER_13]: infestation and by that point,
you know, it's too late, but you see
[SPEAKER_13]: people's like moral compass shift really
quickly when they're faced with huge loss.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest, the only thing I ever
sprayed was a bacteria thernigenus BT.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would do that in vegetative,
but I never sprayed any things on my
[SPEAKER_11]: plants, no teas, none of this kind of crap
crap.
[SPEAKER_11]: I biodynamically fertilized my soil in
between crops and the plants never seemed
[SPEAKER_11]: to need it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That and super, super heavy prevention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was using at one time, 22 different
kinds of predators preventively.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was using them preventively the
majority.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and that's, I think what's so
exciting about like the future of what
[SPEAKER_13]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know, with biodynamic
farming and permaculture models and
[SPEAKER_13]: sustainable soil models of like
regenerating topsoil, creating the most,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, rich, biodiverse, like
microbial.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does cannabis really fit into
permaculture?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an annual, it gets harvested every
year.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just mean more in the model of like,
you know, yeah, it's like using local
[SPEAKER_13]: source inputs and my, you know,
like, you know, kind of acclimated kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: microbes that are, you know, from your,
you know, then just covering all the bases
[SPEAKER_13]: and building the soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I mean, whenever you have like all
the necessary microbes in your soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, oftentimes you're, they're both
helping to find and transport all the
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrients needed and break down and,
you know, kind of send around.
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, you know, kind of they're there
as natural plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like your stomach microbiome and it's
in the air as for an immune system,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: What I've also found in greenhouses is
even if your soil is perfect, and I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about the soil in the earth,
not container soil, and you biodynamically
[SPEAKER_11]: enriched your soil for decades,
pests will still take off if you introduce
[SPEAKER_11]: them into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've created a perfect environment for
pests and an enclosed greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Long drawn out pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's taking a breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make the environment safe for the
plants, but it makes it safe for
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a bong rip with you,
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do find plants, some plants are
resistant to some pests and diseases,
[SPEAKER_11]: but unfortunately most growers,
although they might be looking for those,
[SPEAKER_11]: what they're really looking for is what's
popular and what sells at the moment,
[SPEAKER_11]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and I also think that from our last
conversation, if you were able to express
[SPEAKER_10]: the different types of terpene profiles,
like when you were, we were talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: having all nine of them light up in equal,
equal, you know, you were saying what that
[SPEAKER_10]: flavor and all that kind of stuff was for.
[SPEAKER_10]: But these plants also are responding to
different environments in different areas
[SPEAKER_10]: when they're growing, but terpenes can be
repellents for different things,
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're using and expressing is like a
language.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't be surprised if some terpenes
are attracted to some insects and fungus.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are their natural plant defense
mechanisms, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: To like lure or toward predators and lure
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look what it does to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: It lures us in.
[SPEAKER_10]: It lures deer in.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's all kinds of animals.
[SPEAKER_10]: My little Pomeranian loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: If she can get to it, even if it's in an
edible, ziplocked up, locked up in a
[SPEAKER_10]: backpack, put in a closet, if she can get
to it and get to her mouth into the
[SPEAKER_10]: backpack and open it, she'll hunt it down
and find it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you put her in your garden and we walk
a greenhouse and you've got like,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, two foot plants, all the little
lower leaves along our little path that we
[SPEAKER_10]: walked, she's going to nibble at them all
along the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: She has no control over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe her endocannabinoid system needs a
little shot, Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony should be happy he doesn't have a
great day like my sister.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is the other mystery thing I
kept finding was I've kept, I've tried to
[SPEAKER_10]: keep everything away from her and then I
would come home and you could tell that
[SPEAKER_10]: she was getting high and I was like,
yeah, where is she getting all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I got no edibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's to the point where even the Q-tips
that I clean out, just the little residual
[SPEAKER_10]: on the courts and I put those down,
she's been taking them out of the ashtray
[SPEAKER_10]: and has a little hash dash which she'll
eat.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like that intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like prohibition for your dog,
but it didn't work on us and it won't work
[SPEAKER_07]: on her.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to get her hash, she's going
to get her edibles and nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do dogs have an endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything does not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Insects don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insects have receptors for the terpenes
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you explain that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that may be true, but they don't
have cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dog that is a pretty reliable
indicator for me of when I have a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden that's high in CBD and has
virtually no THC, he will walk with me in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden and with great respect reaches
in and takes off sun leads, usually kids
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year he's been accurate that it
turns out to be a plant that's high in
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, low in TB.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when we get into specific
medicines, this pertains to what Wade
[SPEAKER_04]: brought up as far as which environments do
the plants express themselves most
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficially as far as not being
susceptible to pests and other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also going to find that they breach
their fullest potential in certain terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles in different environments
differently because of what Tony
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned, is they react to the
environment that they're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm really excited that some of
these companies are doing as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: genetically mapping and doing scientific
surveys of cultivators growing the same
[SPEAKER_04]: strains in different geographic
environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the next five years,
we're going to be so much further ahead as
[SPEAKER_04]: far as understanding some of those
manifestations of plants in different
[SPEAKER_04]: geographical areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a medicine maker and someone who's
got huge interest in that, how those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants interpret their environment and how
that changes the terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of certain terpenes is very,
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly it just modifies the profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't create new terpenes because
those are determined by having a terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: synthase for that particular terpene.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those different levels of those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's absolutely true because I grew an
identical clone for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was grown under one hundred thousand
different conditions and we used to GC
[SPEAKER_11]: analyze it and the profile would alter
slightly depending on the environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions, whether they were the most
favorable or the least favorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's my guess on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing I shared with regards to
the people from the dog park was a new
[SPEAKER_12]: study that came out with the Institute of
Ecology in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my first hash church, I talked to you
guys about this, was they came out saying
[SPEAKER_12]: that the most widely spoken language on
the planet is terpene.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's happening is, and a couple of
you had mentioned this, is that these
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes are actually, you know,
a hydrocarbon liner than air.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're coming into our nasal passages.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so our biology is actually
communicating with that plant's biology.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a whole nother physics dynamic
happening with our biology.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bio communication with the plants as well
as the energetic one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we're talking about terpene
profiles, variations of them actually do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything here fits in with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you take a look at the fact
that we've got endocannabinoid systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else does too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Must be that when the Syrians or the Dog
Star people left us off here, they left us
[SPEAKER_03]: with a pot plant and said, look,
we're going to call this a monomachine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a monowana, but this will
sustain you until you get going.
[SPEAKER_11]: So will you believe me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some deeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's as good as any other theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you spent enough time behind the
mosquito truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything will make sense after a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you, both Wade and I have
spent a fair amount of time behind the
[SPEAKER_07]: mosquito truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great quote.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you spend enough time behind the
mosquito truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony's just shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I woke up for this.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know something, something I think
that's really interesting too,
[SPEAKER_13]: is the understanding that there's this
super complex endogenous cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: system.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with some of the understandings that
so many types of disease and disorder
[SPEAKER_13]: might be rooted in some type of
endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then some of Ethan Russo's new work
with the whole idea of cannabomimetics and
[SPEAKER_13]: other types of plants beyond cannabis that
have endocannabinoid system stimulating
[SPEAKER_13]: effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really interesting, this whole kind
of brave new world of almost like compound
[SPEAKER_13]: pharmacy of these blending of cannabinoid
terpenes from the cannabis plant with
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially other types of plants like
echinacea and ashwagandha and different
[SPEAKER_13]: things like probiotics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they have these different
upregulating or different endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: system stimulating aspects.
[SPEAKER_13]: But one interesting one, have you guys
heard, if you know what copal is,
[SPEAKER_13]: copal is this like smudge that's a sap
from a tree.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a smudge that's very commonly burned
in sacred ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Mayan incense.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's this incredibly distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's a certain di-terpene or
something in copal which binds to CD1.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is what happens to THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: THC is a partial CB1, CB2 receptor
agonist.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so binding to CB1 is what helps to
give the psychoactive feeling and effects
[SPEAKER_13]: that modulates slightly by the different
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I wonder to take some amount of this
copal terpene that binds to CB1 as well
[SPEAKER_13]: and adding that into some type of
preparation, is that going to slightly
[SPEAKER_13]: create new effects?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's these two similar CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to be a little bit careful when
you're vaporizing or combusting new
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes that are not found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: With cannabis, all the terpenes that are
there, we have hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_11]: years of experience to show that they
don't cause major problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you start breathing in huge amounts
of copal with THC, it may or may not cause
[SPEAKER_11]: problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although copal, since it's used in
religious ceremonies, I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're running out of time here,
but that could be a whole show about the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system is unlocking what
we've seen in other aspects of natural
[SPEAKER_04]: healing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anecdotally, it's really pointing to how
those things are interacting with the
[SPEAKER_04]: body.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone hasn't read the paper that was
mentioned here, this Dr. Russo's new work
[SPEAKER_04]: on cannabinoids outside of cannabis,
it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just see this trail of things that
we've known forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: KavaRoot is another one that he does a big
piece on in there in how they're building
[SPEAKER_04]: things that interact with the cannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we see essential oil therapies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have all these natural therapies that
we didn't understand why we saw the
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you start to look at what is in
lavender and halanolule.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see how they're interacting with
receptors in the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start to understand, I think this
endocannabinoid system is going to unlock
[SPEAKER_04]: far more than just how cannabis interacts
with the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is the greatest discovery in
medical science in generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny how under-promoted it still is
to this day outside of certain services.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only if you're interested in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What you pay attention to, you become
conscious of.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're so geeked out on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody else is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where the leaders bring so much of
this information to bay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That also brings me to the John McPartland
paper, Karen Feeding of the
[SPEAKER_13]: Endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you start to understand the
endocannabinoid system is this master
[SPEAKER_13]: regulator system that helps to bring about
homeostasis among all our systems in our
[SPEAKER_13]: body.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so crazy how somehow intuitively
stoners and hippies had it right all
[SPEAKER_13]: along.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the paper it shows how certain exercise
things, yoga and aerobic activity
[SPEAKER_13]: upregulate your CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's through doing things like traditional
Chinese medicine, complementary
[SPEAKER_13]: alternative medicine, things like
acupuncture.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's all this research coming about how
your endocannabinoid system is being
[SPEAKER_13]: stimulated in all these ways from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eating probiotics and drinking kombucha
and sauerkraut juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really funny how it all comes back to
show that these alternative ways are
[SPEAKER_13]: actually supportive of this balance in our
life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be surprised if there's not a bell
curve when it comes to endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning that the other side of the bell
curve is overstimulation of the
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid system and from having too
much anondamide or some of the other
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid, natural endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't be surprised if there's
disorders connected with too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Too much pho, which is fatty acid,
which is one of the enzymes that breaks
[SPEAKER_13]: down an anandamide.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say MAGL is what breaks down
2-AG, but pho they're finding in elevated
[SPEAKER_13]: levels in the guts of patients that have
certain irritable bowel and
[SPEAKER_13]: gastrointestinal tract disorder conditions
like Crohn's, IBS, colitis, what have you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it seems like there's some type of
dysbiosis of your endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_13]: in the firing off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with those same patients,
they're finding out that one of the most
[SPEAKER_11]: effective therapies is hypnosis,
which to me implies that they are creating
[SPEAKER_11]: the stress internally that is causing the
disorder rather than it be straight
[SPEAKER_11]: biochemically based.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome because that also then gets
into that new Martin Lee and Adrian
[SPEAKER_13]: Devetley paper that they wrote on,
it's called, they put the project CD,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's called Mind Over Matter Over Mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's amazing because it's all about
these different mechanisms and actions of
[SPEAKER_13]: how the placebo effect and the nocebo
effect or the belief that some medicine or
[SPEAKER_13]: treatment is going to work or a belief
that medicine is not going to work in so
[SPEAKER_13]: many ways is also regulated specifically
by endocannabinoid system function and
[SPEAKER_13]: tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting, let's look at another topic for
the next show.
[SPEAKER_11]: The endocannabinoid system is what changed
cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then after that, a few years later,
they discovered an on-demand, but it was
[SPEAKER_11]: the endocannabinoid discovery I think in
88 that changed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was announced at the ICRS meeting I
attended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I go, I want to thank everybody in
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I was on here, we were
talking about the Collager's Network and
[SPEAKER_04]: people started throwing donations in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to take a second to thank
everybody who's watching who did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I sent the receipts to Marcus or
what we ended up getting, but we were able
[SPEAKER_04]: to get the childproof lids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed a bunch of bottles for kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this little logistic things,
the jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were able to get what we needed for
most of the year because of the help from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Hash Church community that didn't have
to come out of my family's pocket and our
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteers where we normally try to chip
in and get these out to the kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to take a second to thank
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let you know how much of an impact that
had literally on the lives of the kids
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much love to you guys out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very nice of everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was almost $700 that everyone put
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made sure that I got it all to Forrest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I trust 100% that he's doing the good work
with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a nice episode to be able to
make that happen for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, that helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Lebanese were decades ahead of
us.
[SPEAKER_11]: You saw that bag I had of kitty hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was for people like you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the children hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the hash for the children.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam's always got to say that the one quote
they'll take from, there was a guy on
[SPEAKER_07]: there promoting hash first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our prime minister is constantly trying to
protect the children from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not quite sure if he understands
exactly how safe cannabis is, but maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: one day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_07]: More work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks again, Forrest, for what you
do and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people see it and we understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those pictures ring and
struck a lot of souls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for just doing what you do
and keep at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, it's really it's touching lives
and touching hearts everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to come on here maybe in a few
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few weeks or when the time is right to
talk about huge strides we've had here in
[SPEAKER_04]: California and huge progress they've had
with the state legislature that is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be changing the laws in California to
help make what we're doing and help kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of shift how the cannabis industry looks
at charity and opportunities businesses
[SPEAKER_04]: have to participate in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're making huge strides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't do it without everybody's
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really exciting, I think we're
going to start something out of this
[SPEAKER_04]: effort here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That hasn't been done that once we get the
laws written appropriately can be adopted
[SPEAKER_04]: nationwide and hopefully be a model
internationally for people to pick up and
[SPEAKER_04]: take on and just allow this industry to do
what it has the potential to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is thrive and more importantly,
create and spread healing throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: world and just we're going to keep working
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to keep chipping away at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I want to come on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when that gets closer to where we can
talk about a public plan and share with
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody what we're doing, it's just
really exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll work on a new joke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to figure out a good one with
your name forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trick is trying to come up with an
original one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had it my whole life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something along the lines of you can't see
the forest for all the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've heard them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had to lumber through many of them
is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it builds character, builds
character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I got to take it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Run, forest, run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you're not even close to
original.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite thing to do, though,
is when I get that from people on the
[SPEAKER_04]: phone is to just pretend like I've never
heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what is that from?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't heard of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only do they feel original,
but then they're blown away that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: never heard of this movie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Flip it around.
[SPEAKER_11]: What you have to say to them is life is
like the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about for the rest of us?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a six out of ten.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's up there with about the standard
quality of cannabis that I seem to see
[SPEAKER_07]: these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Need to bump that six up to a ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to, you know,
just going to put a little effort into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even a little effort because I'm
looking now and realizing that it's like
[SPEAKER_07]: expertise on all levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like deciding to do a YouTube show
because you have a little bit of content
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're like, oh, I'm going to do a
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of a sudden you realize you have
to start learning about sound and
[SPEAKER_07]: microphones and you have to learn about
editing and transitions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to learn about all this other
shit that you didn't even know existed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I love about Hash Church,
that people are specializing in their in
[SPEAKER_07]: their spaces.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we can all get together,
it really puts a beautiful picture from,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, from seed to resin head and even
beyond to the testing and the consuming,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we all love to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: You would be able to participate in this
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Tony's bounced.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be safe out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's smart of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Subcool said fuck that and hired a sound
man and an engineering guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's it's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome that Sub did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just unfortunately did not do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although one time when I filmed with Tony,
he brought a sound guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of sound, I do also think that
conversation ultrasonic vibration and
[SPEAKER_10]: frequency for pest control is has been
explored all the way yet on a massive
[SPEAKER_10]: level and also vibration in music itself
and how that might enter how that impacts
[SPEAKER_10]: on emotional spiritual level that
translates through how our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: system works in itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think music unlocks quite a few
different things in humans.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you study the life of plants and
the emotional projection that you can put
[SPEAKER_10]: in a plant, what I mean by that is,
you know, the vibe of if you had two of
[SPEAKER_10]: the same plants growing in two different
lab controlled environments and one
[SPEAKER_10]: environment, you came in with positive
vibes, music and spoke to the plant in a
[SPEAKER_10]: reassuring way and said, you know,
you're beautiful every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually signs of that versus
somebody coming in and screaming at the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant, cursing at the plant, saying,
you know, saying I hate you and projecting
[SPEAKER_10]: that onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They feel it and they actually respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just read last night where
ultrasonic pest repellers seem to be to
[SPEAKER_03]: research right now, stressing plants out
big time when you have them on.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, what about around the property,
though, in a strategic grid line?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just read where they did some research
and it looks like the plants were stressed
[SPEAKER_03]: by the constant nonstop ultrasonic sound.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I said it's it's in the early
stages.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think that they're finding the
right frequency.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think frequency and sound,
though, has another ability to unlock a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of things, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you familiar with cymatics?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you know, that kind of speaks to a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just it's a fascinating subject.
[SPEAKER_13]: But without a doubt, like, you know,
it's a secret life of plants, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's like, yes, without a doubt,
you know, I think in your prayers and your
[SPEAKER_13]: blessings, you know, that have a direct
effect on, you know, the output.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony, when I was younger, like 18,
20 years old, I used to honestly believe
[SPEAKER_11]: that the vibes of the grower somehow
affected the potency or quality of the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know a lot of people who who who do
believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just have never seen any scientific
proof of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I would I would I would say
what's what's funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a gentleman in Oregon
who I would say is a testament to it
[SPEAKER_13]: working.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a breeder, a good friend of mine
named Green Bodhi, a gentleman named John.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's in this whole kind of idea of,
like, intentional horticulture,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and he's, you know, kind of
really deep down his Buddhist Dharma
[SPEAKER_13]: philosophy path.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's right now out kind of kicking
with the Dalai Lama and his crew.
[SPEAKER_13]: At this big teaching kind of situation
over on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_13]: But honestly, to this day, it's the best
weed I've ever seen in my life from
[SPEAKER_13]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like space weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's organic.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's grown really simply.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, there's, you know,
that's an anecdote.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to me, what you want is the right
genetics and to grow it the right way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm not sure whether the bar vibes of
the farmer has any effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when the vibes are conscious and
raised in high integrity, and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: focused on much more of what's going on,
like maybe not spraying poisons and maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: not doing things that would bring harm to
others.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from that, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm talking about is if everything is
identical, except for the mental attitude
[SPEAKER_11]: of the grower, but everything else is
totally identical.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that Dr. Emoto work with the like
water drops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, messages in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a real thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's that's one of those.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny because, you know, as you know,
the moment you start talking about that
[SPEAKER_13]: around more scientific minded people,
it immediately kind of gets thrown out,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, for hippie dippy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, it's really interesting
because, you know, I think you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis is this power wisdom plant,
you know, conscious expanding kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: paradigm shifting, similar to a lot of
these other plant entheogens have been
[SPEAKER_13]: around for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I definitely I don't know,
I don't know his romantic like hope.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, so much of my hope for
humanity lies within the wisdom of the
[SPEAKER_13]: teachings of these power plants,
you know, shifting our awareness,
[SPEAKER_13]: shifting our consciousness and helping us
to live a more mindful based approach
[SPEAKER_13]: towards life and, you know, being kind.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, obviously, we're getting there when
you think about just the fact that how
[SPEAKER_07]: many people I've met over the years in the
cannabis industry are truly like maybe not
[SPEAKER_07]: taking the best care of themselves in
other aspects, but just so focused on the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant that they love that they want it to
be the safest and the healthiest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, like I'm not laughing at
that hypocrisy because I'm sure I've lived
[SPEAKER_07]: it and I'm living my own hypocrisies as I
speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not trying to talk down on anyone,
but it's in that experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in that hypocrisy that you can learn
to be from one side and to move over to
[SPEAKER_07]: the other side, the part that you weren't
thinking about, the part that you weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: aware.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people should welcome that
hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They shouldn't look down on it like it's
the worst thing ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hypocrisy is the bridge that leads us from
where we were to hopefully where we want
[SPEAKER_07]: to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ignorance is just a state of being
uninformed and an opportunity to learn if
[SPEAKER_13]: you're open to it and not cognitively
dissonant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have something you wanted to add,
Wade?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also technologically challenged.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got to sign off here pretty soon,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just thank you for the invite
and any time that it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thrilled to join this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, I really feel blessed by the
perspectives, the different points of view
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being offered here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you folks are people I've
known of for years and never had a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet with or talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marcus, I really want to bless you and
thank you for putting together panels like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and doing it every day over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important that
this information be available to more
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really hoping that the Chash Church
turns into a huge presence in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world simply for both the depth and the
heartfeltness of belief in the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: what it can do for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think for the world,
it really is the healing of the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: to use a phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just over and over again,
I'm amazed at what I hear in these few
[SPEAKER_00]: times I've been with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very affirming to me to be in
your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be really effective, we need to reach
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Within our own community, everything
you're saying is true.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a cannabis convert already,
it's all true.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the vast majority of the planet are
not converted.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blessings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming in, Wade.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll definitely have you in again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look forward to it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, such a great panel today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good people, good conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved the way it started, the middle,
throughout the end of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved having us call each other on the
information that we know and might know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just it is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Sam said, you know, and one of
the things I don't very often sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: request, which you'll hear me maybe in
chat, at least more and more.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now, listen, if you're watching and you
want to help, you want to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharing the link to Hash Church is a good
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can share it and get it out and
help build the live audience, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_07]: get back up to a thousand or even above
and beyond that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to try and make a photo,
a nice, beautiful photograph.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each week where we'll have the Hash Church
episode and maybe who's going to be some
[SPEAKER_07]: guests.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be able to share that via
Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is definitely a way that you
guys, the audience in chat can do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll also make a point on putting up
the link to Hash Church every Saturday
[SPEAKER_07]: afternoon after I do my wake and bake
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll be able to have a place to come
and chat for the almost 24 hours prior to
[SPEAKER_07]: the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll make that happen.
Epic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alec, thanks for coming in today,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're a hard guy to get in and you
probably were.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you said a few of the things you said
today made me laugh so hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said something like something
about the webbing in full web mode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, if you're in full web mode.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you also said, you also said,
oh, I was the Grinch of Chalice this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is so fucking funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry you had to go through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for doing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for doing the hard work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, it's a blessing, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: So grateful, so blessed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's such an amazing kind of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a lot of shit Alec, but I mean,
in the end, I mean, you just defer to,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, science is science is science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I didn't poo poo your fucking
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You poo pooed your reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science just verified it and validated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure the reaction.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing because I've had this
conversation so many times and I can in so
[SPEAKER_13]: many words help people deduce down to a
specific space where they didn't think
[SPEAKER_13]: about the contamination coming from.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it feels so great to help people
arrive at like a aha moment about a
[SPEAKER_13]: certain thing of vulnerability in their
business that they took such pride in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, I'm in service to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: The honest truth is people have ignored
this for decades.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been going on with imported products
that they were using poisonous sprays down
[SPEAKER_11]: in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_11]: And until it's publicly acknowledged and
people are forced to admit their mistakes,
[SPEAKER_11]: they will not change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what a great way for them to be sort
of forced to see it through the
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective of, you know, critically ill
and catastrophically ill, both adults and
[SPEAKER_07]: children who these these small amounts
that might not seem to a healthy person's
[SPEAKER_07]: daily consumption to be that big of a
deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, some of them are a great deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure some of them are probably
accumulative in the body.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the science behind it,
but I wouldn't be surprised to hear that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, some of these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which is terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone should know like that should be
the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're consuming something that's
accumulative in the body that tends to
[SPEAKER_07]: stick around for your lifetime,
that seems kind of insane that there
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't be some sort of a little maybe
giant, huge label that actually has an
[SPEAKER_07]: audio button that you push and it screams
at you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they do it with they do it now with
cigarettes because they got sued for so
[SPEAKER_10]: long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's basically like, hey, we just want
to let you know that we've got one hundred
[SPEAKER_10]: and fifty additives in this.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're one hundred and something
different addictive chemicals in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more addictive than morphine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And every cigarette takes 30 minutes off
your life.
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't hear that loud enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a website, commercials,
truth campaigns.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to tell you not to buy our
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Macro photographs of cancerous at least at
least in Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the packages of cigarettes,
they have pictures of people who are all
[SPEAKER_11]: fucked up from cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They give you the warning labels.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They give you everything that you should
know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, they're ten dollars a
pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus, what a racket.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is truly an unbelievable racket.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to get too deep into
that one because I'm hypersensitive to
[SPEAKER_07]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make me very ill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tend to turn gay.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're green and throw up if I'm around
large concentrations of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've always felt like it's kind of the
worst payback ever when you like turn on
[SPEAKER_07]: someone to this beautiful cannabis resin
that you have here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have this, you know, smoke a little bit of
this and try it.
[SPEAKER_07]: See how you feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're just like, oh,
that feels great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't mind if I light a cigarette,
do you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right in your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, I do now feel like a bag of
shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You and you and I are very similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: If somebody starts smoking a cigarette on
us, we just happen to scatter as quick as
[SPEAKER_10]: possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a militant anti tobacco smoker.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been known to spray Osium on people's
cigarettes on airplanes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Airplanes are allowed to have cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's when I was in Amsterdam,
everyone was rolling it with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first time I was in a cafe and I
just rolled up, you know, just a joint
[SPEAKER_10]: with I think I had some bubble or
something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoked it and everybody gave me the evil
eye.
[SPEAKER_10]: The pure, the pure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why you smoke the pure, the pure,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackhead back then.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason the Dutch don't smoke pure is
because they're too cheap.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tobacco is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they mix it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like the pure and I'm like,
why would you, why would you, why would
[SPEAKER_11]: you mix something that also cannabis is a
learned experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the first time you smoke cannabis,
it's mixed with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then that's one of the cues your body is
brain is looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you smoke pure, you have trouble
realizing you're even high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That tobacco, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Harsh on the throat, harsh on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I'll show you what I mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny because tobacco was a sacred
plant to the American Indians.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course they were not growing it
mixed with chemicals and all this other
[SPEAKER_11]: crap crap like modern cigarettes with
glycerin to keep it burning.
[SPEAKER_11]: But still it was a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: They used it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would take big doses of it and get
psychedelic on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, you know, also,
you know, I'm really psyched that you
[SPEAKER_13]: brought that up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tobacco has always been viewed as this
really sacred, super powerful plant
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine and a lot of different healing
traditions for like thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and, and, you know, one of the
most, I was sitting in an Iowa ceremony
[SPEAKER_13]: once and this shaman from Brazil kind of
blew my mind so hard on this, what you
[SPEAKER_13]: said, and he was the way he talked about
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was saying how tobacco is such a
powerful like amplifier spirit to like
[SPEAKER_13]: amplify your prayers and intentions and
blessings.
[SPEAKER_13]: And which is one of the reasons why it's
so commonly used in these ceremonial
[SPEAKER_13]: spaces, you know, and the shaman will be
smoking it and kind of blowing it on
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody or, you know, it's used in a
tobacco, like in the preparation that you
[SPEAKER_13]: blow on your nose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't they using, aren't they using
commercial cigarettes and not using
[SPEAKER_11]: tobacco?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, I mean, in, in, I mean,
in ceremony, typically like they'll use
[SPEAKER_13]: like tobacco, rustica, you know,
kind of grown down South America or what
[SPEAKER_13]: have you.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, but, but my point is, is,
you know, what, what, what, what was
[SPEAKER_13]: spoken through the words of the shaman was
that, you know, tobacco is used so
[SPEAKER_13]: improperly by the Western world because in
all healing traditions, it's never inhaled
[SPEAKER_13]: into your lungs because tobacco has the
power to create or destroy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and whenever it's taken into lungs,
you know, it's smoked in the way that's
[SPEAKER_13]: done in the Western world and just
thinking about your stresses and all the
[SPEAKER_13]: things in life.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no, there was no tobacco you
could inhale into your lungs until after
[SPEAKER_11]: the 1860s, when they invented bright
tobacco in America by, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, by the ship he was improved during
it, but the ship he was in Peru have been
[SPEAKER_13]: using kind of tobacco, rustica for a
thousand years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Same thing with, you know, certain
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't inhale that into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, but it's not meant to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it kills you if you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's what it's the way, the way in
native American traditions, the way
[SPEAKER_13]: tobacco is used is taken in your mouth,
not inhaled and then blown out with the
[SPEAKER_13]: power of all your prayers and spirits,
you know, and content, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: intention, you know, and so, so it's used.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the way it was described by the shaman
is that, you know, it has the power to
[SPEAKER_13]: create or destroy and it's destroying so
much more because of the way it's used,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and it's so far off the
medicinal use of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: and, and I'm not advocating for,
you know, taking smoke in your mouth and
[SPEAKER_13]: blowing it out and not inhaling,
you know, but, but, you know, certain
[SPEAKER_13]: tobacco preparations like Hopay,
which is so commonly used.
[SPEAKER_11]: They still do that with pipes and cigars.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just found it very interesting because
it's like, it's, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's so, so, so common used in so many
different healing traditions around the
[SPEAKER_13]: world for so long and it hasn't had the
same effects on just wiping out the
[SPEAKER_13]: populations as, as here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, they attribute it
basically just to our disrespectful and
[SPEAKER_09]: improper use of it, you know, which is an
alkaloid, which is again, a completely
[SPEAKER_09]: different ball game.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicotine is toxic, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so imagine again, the cannabis
plant doesn't have a non-toxic component,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tobacco has a toxic component.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think like a dose of somewhere between
50 to 80 milligrams can kill an adult
[SPEAKER_09]: human being.
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine a dose of 50 to 80 milligrams of
THC if that killed a human being.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're two different, different
biologies, two different plants,
[SPEAKER_09]: two different chemistries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unlike, you know, nicotine or unlike
tobacco, the cannabis essential oil is
[SPEAKER_09]: remarkably free of nitrogen-containing
compounds, where if you look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: essential oil of tobacco and nicotine
itself, which is a pyrrolidine-based
[SPEAKER_09]: alkaloid, these things are not thermally
stable and they undergo Hoffman
[SPEAKER_09]: degradation when you heat them up in the
presence of air.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they degrade into a variety of
different just downstream products.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, they're two very,
very different plants, two very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very different.
[SPEAKER_11]: And tobacco itself,
[SPEAKER_11]: when you blue cure it, to produce bright
tobacco, which is all modern cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_11]: it changes the pH.
[SPEAKER_11]: That allows it to be inhaled and absorbed
through the lungs, which made it way more
[SPEAKER_11]: addictive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's an interesting plant that
obviously, you know, when looked at from
[SPEAKER_07]: the shamanic perspective, many shamans
using tobacco as a ways to sort of almost,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, uncover things and also leave
breadcrumbs to get back from these
[SPEAKER_07]: journeys on certain psychedelics,
that it's not surprising that somehow,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you know, we got ahold of it and
turned it into this, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: inverted version of itself, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of shamans also will take a mouthful
of distilled spirits and spray it on their
[SPEAKER_11]: subject.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I don't use distilled spirits.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't use tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, nor do I.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never did.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you just spit on people then?
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to as often as I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: What have we got?
[SPEAKER_07]: Three and a half hours of hash church.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty slammin'.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty slammin'.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything you wanted to tell us
about anyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone have anything they wanted to say
that they didn't get to say yet?
[SPEAKER_07]: That they've been sitting on the whole
time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wanted to go back to the thing I
was saying earlier about contamination.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do have, you know, for whatever
reason, like a contaminated batch of
[SPEAKER_09]: material, you can reclaim.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of advances in membrane
separation and chromatographic separation
[SPEAKER_09]: technologies that will enable you to
basically remediate contaminated oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you think about it, just like water
filtration systems, a lot of these are
[SPEAKER_09]: basically membranes that have,
again, certain wetting capacities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is a disposable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, Marcus, what happens I was thinking
about your question that you asked before,
[SPEAKER_09]: like if you do filter the stuff through
like the silicone, what do you do with the
[SPEAKER_09]: silicone?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's kind of like, well,
what do you do with the cartridge in your
[SPEAKER_09]: filter that filters your water for your
kitchen or your refrigerator?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these things, so even if you did,
like Andrew's always talked about having
[SPEAKER_09]: an activated charcoal and molecular
sieves, well, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_09]: chromatographic supports that will
basically bind up any trace amounts of
[SPEAKER_09]: residue.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you took an ethanol solution of
these things, run it through, hang up the
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff, and then just material tested by
Alec before and after, and see if your
[SPEAKER_09]: chromatographic separation actually gets
rid of the material.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's- Is that scalable?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is used in water remediation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I work with companies that,
yeah, do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time in the oil and the food
industry as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, there's all kinds of different
membranes and different types of
[SPEAKER_09]: separation technology.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should be spreading this
knowledge because the truth of it is it
[SPEAKER_11]: will encourage people to use pesticides to
protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Produce big, giant, so-called healthy
crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they say, well, we could clean it
up afterwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: For what it's worth, I actually really
appreciate you bringing that because I
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't know if I wanted to say it,
but just on some romantic level,
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of was hoping that pesticide
removal wasn't going to be scalable or
[SPEAKER_13]: would ultimately fail because I feel like
the biggest demand for that service is
[SPEAKER_13]: going to be the big mono-crop gnarly guys
that are just trying to cut the,
[SPEAKER_13]: and just figure it out like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like as long as there's type
pesticide regulations and you can't remove
[SPEAKER_13]: pesticides, it's almost going to work out
better for the small guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the people who are deciding not to use
them in the first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, that's, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just thinking just from the
point of view that someone's made an
[SPEAKER_09]: investment in some material.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did some testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a good idea that this material
was contaminant-free.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they've taken that material and
they've processed it into a concentrate,
[SPEAKER_09]: like a rosin, and now it comes up hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, shit, what do they do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they just flush that $50,000 down the
toilet?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do they try to remediate that material
to make medicine out of it?
[SPEAKER_09]: The point I'm trying to make, Sam,
I'm not trying to say that this is how it
[SPEAKER_09]: should be done, but the point is that
there are ways of basically cleaning these
[SPEAKER_09]: things up so you can actually recoup the
medicine that you have.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think if people know that,
it will encourage the thoughtless to mass
[SPEAKER_11]: produce with pesticides and clean it up
later?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because cleaning it up basically
marginalizes the product somewhat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because now you're probably cleaning out
other things as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think Alec asked a really
important question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it scalable?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very, very important to be
able to point out the fact that when
[SPEAKER_09]: you're removing trace amounts of material
from, say, a large amount of oil or a
[SPEAKER_09]: large amount of extract, you can easily
overload the capacity of any of these
[SPEAKER_09]: smaller columns.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like running a lot of crap
through your water filtration system for
[SPEAKER_09]: home.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, eventually the capacity of that
column is going to be overloaded.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not going to function anymore,
which is why you got to do a test before
[SPEAKER_09]: and after.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm not saying that you should
use remediation as part of your production
[SPEAKER_09]: process, Sam, which I think is what you're
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying that if you're in a situation
where you already have material that
[SPEAKER_09]: you've already made an investment in
rather than throwing away, it can be
[SPEAKER_09]: remediated and it can be purified.
[SPEAKER_09]: And test results can show that this stuff
now passes the pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see both points.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see the one point more than the other,
but I see where Mark's coming from too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see every time he says, what are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw that $50,000 away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where Alec and Sam are cringing
the most.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I would throw it away in a hot
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what Mark's addressing is that
they're not.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what they're doing is that
they're getting it into the market,
[SPEAKER_10]: whether it's quote unquote medicine or
black market.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just getting it to people because
those people are turning a profit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not turning medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, OK, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need to move this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they'll sell it in a market where
they don't have to have testing
[SPEAKER_09]: requirements on the package or it'll be
black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it'll lose some value in the
market, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they can't put a label on it and
sell it for the market for which it was
[SPEAKER_09]: intended.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point is, is that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, the ethics of it is that the
material can be salvaged.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Able to have a way to reproducibly clean
up contaminated oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: That shows contamination at a certain
level when again, some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination could be there, not from a
foliar application or anything that the
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivator did.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be contaminated from either the
soil or just unintentional contamination
[SPEAKER_09]: from some other source.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if we if we were in a much
more regulated situation and we the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry itself took the all of the things
that we need to do to be proactive in this
[SPEAKER_10]: middle ground right now where,
you know, there's no repercussions.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it was organized and we had all of
these lines of defense, if you will,
[SPEAKER_10]: from the genetics to the cultivating and
extracting, if somebody or their material
[SPEAKER_10]: was found with contaminants and had
pesticides, you don't even want to just
[SPEAKER_10]: throw it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bad for the environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a remediation process, maybe what
happens is, you know, material can't go
[SPEAKER_10]: into the market and it has to be processed
prior to even getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there might be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Potentially a potentially a it's kind of
like how the clean hazardous waste,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, how our sewer systems work and
the clean hazardous waste before it gets
[SPEAKER_10]: re-released.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that would be on a larger
scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you need to worry so much,
Tony, because if you think about the
[SPEAKER_11]: average trash dump, all of the America's
food is getting dumped there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you don't think there's any
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the problem is not the pollution
contaminating the environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is the people are using the
goddamn things in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on top of that, you also have,
you know, statisticians are coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that even in legal states and where
things will come online and regulated,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're still expecting a third of the
market to still remain illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as much as I'd love the utopian
idealist, that you're posing there that if
[SPEAKER_02]: something is negative, it should be
destroyed, which I agree, because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens in other environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody takes barley that's failed and goes
along and sells it, you know, on the side,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some people do illegally,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they're still not allowed
to carry that into other markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's still going to continue until
the it's going to come from the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to demand the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: The black market will continue as long as
the prices remain so high.
[SPEAKER_11]: As soon as the prices get below a certain
level, there will be no black market
[SPEAKER_11]: because there's no money in the black
market.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just interesting, though,
when you consider how much like tonnage of
[SPEAKER_13]: herb is grown in California every year and
like literally probably like 85 percent of
[SPEAKER_13]: it or something like that goes elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's amazing to think how I
mean, it seems like such a impossible
[SPEAKER_13]: responsibility for a regulated model to
actually be able to get it all to stay in
[SPEAKER_13]: state.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's not it seems like it's going
to be because it can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't stay in state.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so overgrow the government idea,
you know, I feel like it's just going to
[SPEAKER_13]: keep doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants Cali herb, like not just
California.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, how are you going to this is the
problem with these legal sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: platforms.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't allow for everything and
they put rules, too many rules,
[SPEAKER_07]: then the black market just continues to do
its thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, well, especially when the
prices are still based on prohibition and
[SPEAKER_11]: not on straight agricultural conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at look at my eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two dispensaries in Nevada and the
prices of Nevada are high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's and there's no way that the
illegal market is going to go away as the
[SPEAKER_02]: ungodly amount of taxation and over
taxation that we have seen in these
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to also go away because there are
again, as we have talked about in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, they're looking through these
prohibition induced eyeglasses that have
[SPEAKER_02]: produced this false high price of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we see in these legal states,
it's considerably coming down and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: only continuing to come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the time rates and what are the
tax rates in Nevada?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've seen a couple of posts on
this week that I couldn't believe the
[SPEAKER_09]: taxes that were on a receipt, but I think
the receipt may have been fake news.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like what would an eighth like is an
eighth going to cost somewhere between 40
[SPEAKER_09]: to 50 bucks and be taxed?
[SPEAKER_09]: How much?
[SPEAKER_09]: How much are you going to walk out of that
transaction?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not done then done an actual
transaction at the retail at the adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being done every day at my facility,
but I have not actually gone there because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's only in one facility in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently are inclined one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to wait for the laws to change in
inclined, which are set to take path at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of this month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on August 1st, we'll be able to
do an adult sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the adult sale tax is unfortunately
very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it can be as I know is up to 60 to
80 dollars per eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that price.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it's obnoxious, but this is
unfortunately we're dealing with limited
[SPEAKER_02]: supply, limited suppliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also already happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened up in Washington state is
happening to some of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suppliers is that they didn't order enough
stock for when they went legal and now
[SPEAKER_02]: they're already running out of cannabis
and a lot of the distributors don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: even the licenses yet or the ability to
transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're still dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the realities of the supply
chain isn't even fully up to snuff yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have already been inundated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, under prohibition, under
prohibition, people were basically growing
[SPEAKER_11]: under lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the biggest method.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the production costs under lights has
a certain basic minimum.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's probably like, I don't know,
five hundred bucks a pound or a thousand
[SPEAKER_11]: or whatever, whatever the price is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not an underlight grower, so I don't
know exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you grow that in a greenhouse,
you cut the price by three quarters.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you grow it outdoors, you can cut the
price by 90 percent again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's ten thousand dollar pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just like over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and this is what over regulation is
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to have to we have to go
through these growing pains,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately, to finally get to the
reality that we're going to, because
[SPEAKER_02]: again, we're dealing with knee jerk
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state's going to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_09]: The state of Nevada is full of a bunch of
wise guys, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, though, I think the price of herb is
going to go up before it goes down,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, because I think although there
is such an abundance flood of weed
[SPEAKER_13]: everywhere and, you know, people are
growing outdoor, having such a hard time
[SPEAKER_13]: even getting for like seven to eight
thousand dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's you know, I think I think
it's an artificial or I mean, I think it's
[SPEAKER_13]: true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, my point, my point, my only point I
was going to make is just like,
[SPEAKER_13]: although there's an abundance of herb on
the market, I think a lot of the big
[SPEAKER_13]: manufacturers and producers who are
sourcing so much trim, trying to find
[SPEAKER_13]: abundance to trim, they're having this
reality check of like how actually there's
[SPEAKER_13]: a crisis of scarcity of clean material.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think I think for the clean
material, the price is going to go up
[SPEAKER_13]: before it goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's one of the reasons why
it's also so high is because it is tested,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and we have to deal with all the
prices and prices and dispenses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pricing and dispensaries are, like you
say, going slightly higher, remaining
[SPEAKER_11]: constant or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: But wholesale prices in California,
they're a fraction of what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that that fluctuation will
change with the regular with the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations that happen here in
California.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, because I think,
you know, like if you look at Colorado,
[SPEAKER_13]: the price of trim in so many ways,
it's so hard to find really good quality
[SPEAKER_13]: trim.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I mean, for really good,
you know, four to eight hundred bucks a
[SPEAKER_13]: pound.
[SPEAKER_13]: People have been known to pay,
you know, and you know, when you consider
[SPEAKER_13]: what people are selling for California,
how worthless, you know, or I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: or just people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just there's so much abundance of
material.
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, you know, I think, you know,
just working with a lot of really big
[SPEAKER_13]: manufacturers, people who are trying to
support hundreds of thousands of pounds a
[SPEAKER_13]: month or a week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who pays forty eight hundred dollars a
pound for trim?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard of such a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not forty eight.
[SPEAKER_13]: I said four to eight hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, four hundred.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even that's quite high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think, you know, I think whenever
people are realizing the scarcity of clean
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine, I think he's also comparing
indoor market to a outdoor market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Outdoor, you'll see it fifty to two
hundred and all indoor, basically what
[SPEAKER_10]: he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, but but just in general,
I think I just think, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: as as we go into this regulated space,
I just think the value of clean herb is
[SPEAKER_13]: going to spike much more, you know,
because because I think I have a heart of
[SPEAKER_13]: mine, consistent, clean, unlimited source
of material.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's the biggest problem
with supply chain stuff that most
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses have.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could have all the dreams you want.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're if you know, once
regulations kick in and you're relying on
[SPEAKER_13]: hundreds of thousands of pounds a month,
it's like if you don't know any dude
[SPEAKER_13]: holding clean weed, you're like you don't
have anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're dead in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I got this from my guys in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sixty five dollars pre tax with taxes
about seventy six eighty six fourneeth.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, that's that's top shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's top shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's top shelf.
That's top shelf.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a percent, is that fifteen,
twenty percent?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sales tax by county plus a 10
percent excise tax for recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they pay a specific tax like in 10
percent there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be 15 percent here in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Same in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the same same system.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: If cannabis is legal, the taxes don't
bother me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to say just complaining
about taxes sure seems less serious than
[SPEAKER_07]: complaining about how your house got used
to always sit around and joke like 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The joke, you know, it'll never happen in
our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would turn to the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they were to tax it, you know,
I'm fine with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the it's a short term reality
as what it is, because there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustments as things happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the reality if we got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's here it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what you're at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, is to lower basic production costs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it's a tax of 10 or 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's only costing one hundred dollars
a kilo of manicured dry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it will have to be taken by the
distributors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be all across the chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this is the growing pains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, they'll still be someone when Sam
comes out and grows it for one hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars a kilo, they'll still be someone
that says, listen, we have to charge three
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand dollars a kilo because we have a
very large overhead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, we need to keep our head above
water here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's hard to take the price of
herb down because truly, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: first of all, there's never enough of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Alec was saying, like how many
companies if all you do is extractions or
[SPEAKER_07]: processing, if you don't have
relationships with people who actually
[SPEAKER_07]: have material that is not latent with
pests, diseases, pesticides, all these
[SPEAKER_07]: things, then you have nothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured it out one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fifty square miles, I think maybe even 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, produce all the cannabis that is
consumed in America for a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so you weren't even taking into
account Canada's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, just just Americans, whether they
were smoking the straight herb or whether
[SPEAKER_11]: they were grinding it up and making
extracts or whether they were making dry
[SPEAKER_11]: sift or water hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking at the whole picture and I
figured the consumption was between 40 and
[SPEAKER_11]: 50 square miles per year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: About six months ago, I figured it out
based on cannabis consumption when though,
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's growing, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the present one.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 100 square miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just just in case.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 50 square miles, give or take.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a small spec of California
agricultural property.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes sense, Sam, because isn't like
most of the more opium that's grown for
[SPEAKER_07]: the pharmaceutical industry grown on like
a small island, like 90 percent of it or
[SPEAKER_07]: something?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Tasmania grows.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually a GMO opium plant which
doesn't produce traditional morphine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got I think I forget what the Mark
probably knows what it produces,
[SPEAKER_11]: but then they convert that to morphine so
that junkies can't use the flowers
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to create like soccer mom
junkies, not like, you know, junkie
[SPEAKER_07]: junkies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, you have to buy pharmaceutical
drugs and it's OK to be addicted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you go get your your shit from the
pharmacy, you're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_07]: these are the junkies we want to create.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy how they've changed the face of
addiction because here and here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Vancouver, I mean, six thousand overdoses
last year, not deaths, six thousand
[SPEAKER_07]: overdoses last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: In three hundred sixty five days,
six thousand people overdosed on like
[SPEAKER_07]: fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's unfortunately widespread all
across the entire United States right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, fentanyl like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so evil, you know, that that's a
compound that's been able to be created
[SPEAKER_13]: and pharmaceuticalized because of how much
more multiple, like exponentially more
[SPEAKER_13]: addictive and strong it is than morphine.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's like that's why we're
creating this alternative healing world,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, truly.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have newer analogues, which are 10 to
100 times more potent than pure fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_11]: I trust those even less.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's car fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brutal, brutal shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's serious, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when you have that many people
passing away and not just like the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and for me, I never see them as
undesirables, but society does.
[SPEAKER_07]: They see people who are junkies living
under bridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy for them to say goodbye to those
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they are drug addicts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now with oxycodone and fentanyl,
drug addicts are everyday people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not living under bridges anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're living in homes and they're just
like teenage girls and boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're and they're our brothers,
our sisters, our uncles, our fathers,
[SPEAKER_02]: our brothers, our sisters.
[SPEAKER_07]: They always were.
[SPEAKER_07]: They always were.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were harder than those homes
long.
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to sell them so they can buy
some more fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear about the addiction quality of
fentanyl and how often they have to hit
[SPEAKER_07]: that every day, like four or five,
six times a day, or they can go through
[SPEAKER_07]: withdrawal four or five or six times a
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_11]: The worst thing about fentanyl is maybe,
too, that if you take the exact same
[SPEAKER_11]: measured dose time after time after time,
one time, it just kills you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It becomes a clumentative or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something different about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Heroin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had the exact same measured dose,
it doesn't kill you all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, heroin kind of preserves people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at Keith Richards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in the chat was saying they lost
a friend on Friday from an overdose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keith Richard looks haggard, by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: He does.
[SPEAKER_11]: He does.
[SPEAKER_11]: He does look haggard, but he's alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess is what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the third best thing he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the day, Alec.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just been a few key things that
have made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keith Richards looks haggard.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clearly, I'm baked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else enjoying their day?
[SPEAKER_07]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although you may have noticed I was a
little bit late.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because I was asleep until my wife
came and woke me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny because people were like,
Sam, not coming into church.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Sam's coming into church.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like a half an hour went by.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I think Sam's coming into
church.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was like 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, I will admit I sent your wife a
message.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking forward to Sam on church.
[SPEAKER_11]: She wasn't home either, which was part of
the reason why I was sleeping.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was off at the beach having fun with
our granddaughter and having a good time
[SPEAKER_11]: at the beach.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she came back, hashed her,
she'd been on for an hour and I was
[SPEAKER_11]: asleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I'm thankful.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was definitely like lots of stuff
that was being said in the hour that I
[SPEAKER_07]: felt was pertinent to your being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm glad you ended up making it in for
certain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, I guess, well,
I guess I should really thank everyone for
[SPEAKER_07]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a great panel today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alec, thank you as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's hard for you sometimes to get
up at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: on the Sunday morning for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's maybe only one of the only days you
get to have to yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do appreciate you coming in and
representing your respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: All all that you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We certainly don't think of you as the
Grinch here at Hatch Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, thank you to Etienne for
always being first in the room and always
[SPEAKER_07]: staying right to the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, brother, sorry to hear about
your old man.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know you're doing well and I'm glad
you got your computer fixed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're back on Hatch Church with us
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that still happening next week that you
were talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you know in a private message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I won't be around next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the weekend after I'm taking that
trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, when I do come,
I'm going to the island just for like four
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's during Hatch Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you're on the island.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good four hours, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be thinking of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as always.
[SPEAKER_07]: I chimed in from Aruba.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did.
[SPEAKER_07]: But only four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be really serious commitment to
be chiming in for like any amount of time
[SPEAKER_07]: if you were only there for four hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Mark, for coming in and
always setting us straight on all things
[SPEAKER_07]: scientific chemistry based.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Skunkman Sam, we're glad that you woke
up and made it in here for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was happy to have both Wade in from the
House of Harlequin and Forrest in from the
[SPEAKER_07]: Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_07]: And check those guys out by just simply
Googling their names and their networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: House of Harlequin and Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as always, thanks, Tony, for making it
in as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we had a long night yesterday at
Chalice collecting trophies with Gold Drop
[SPEAKER_07]: and Blue River.
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to those guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They swept it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to Indra for coming out and
Peter from Soil Balance Pro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you, everyone in the audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a good 700 people watching pretty
solid today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're down to 500 now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four hours committed to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the best for the books.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I look forward to next week when we'll
do it all again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
