[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Paul.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fine?
[SPEAKER_11]: You always say you're fine no matter what.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Tinker.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what you been up to?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the usual.
[SPEAKER_19]: The usual?
[SPEAKER_19]: The usual.
[SPEAKER_19]: Too much trouble.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're up to the usual.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am up to the usual.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_19]: This takes care of my nausea, happiness,
and my toleration.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not a bit ashamed of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had one lung removed.
[SPEAKER_19]: The last time I was in, they found a
degenerated disc from cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: They put me in terminal.
[SPEAKER_19]: My grandson and my daughter, one or the
other, mentioned marijuana to me one day.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I said, hey, I'll try anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's when they rise 109 pounds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I smoked a couple of marijuanas and
ate a half a chocolate cake that night.
[SPEAKER_19]: My appetite started coming back.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had what they call the munchies.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they haven't ceased.
[SPEAKER_28]: They haven't.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm up to 143 pounds.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cannabis, marijuana, pot, hashish,
it goes by many names.
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever it's called, it's often the
center of controversy.
[SPEAKER_16]: To many people, the drug that comes from
this plant is a dangerous narcotic,
[SPEAKER_16]: a gateway to hard drugs and a life of
addiction.
[SPEAKER_16]: So its use must be suppressed under the
full weight of the law.
[SPEAKER_16]: On the other hand, a growing number
regards it as a benign medicine that
[SPEAKER_16]: provides effective relief from the pain of
arthritis, seizures of epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_16]: and many other ills.
[SPEAKER_16]: In North America, these two opposing views
have created a highly charged emotional
[SPEAKER_16]: conflict.
[SPEAKER_16]: In this atmosphere, it's difficult to
weigh the merits of different points of
[SPEAKER_16]: view.
[SPEAKER_16]: So is cannabis really a dangerous drug?
[SPEAKER_16]: How effective is it as a medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: My son, who in 1967 was diagnosed as
having acute lymphatic leukemia,
[SPEAKER_06]: he was 10 years old then.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time he reached the age of 13,
was beginning to get some of the cancer
[SPEAKER_06]: chemotherapeutic substances which cause
severe nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would vomit for about eight hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have the dry heaves for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would vomit in the car on the way home
from the hospital and just lie in his room
[SPEAKER_06]: with his head over a bucket on the floor.
[SPEAKER_16]: At a dinner party, a colleague told how
marijuana had dramatically reduced nausea
[SPEAKER_16]: in a similar case.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the way home from that dinner party,
my wife, Betsy, said, well, maybe we
[SPEAKER_06]: should get some marijuana for Danny.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm ashamed to say, I said,
no, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's against the law and we don't want to
embarrass the people at the children's
[SPEAKER_06]: hospital who are taking such great care of
Danny.
[SPEAKER_06]: His next chemotherapy was due a couple of
weeks later and Betsy and Danny smoked in
[SPEAKER_06]: the parking lot outside of the children's
hospital.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't believe what happened because
not only did he not have any nausea,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he even added he asked his mother,
could we get a submarine sandwich on the
[SPEAKER_06]: way home?
[SPEAKER_06]: I then called Dr. Jaffe, who was the
doctor who was directly involved in
[SPEAKER_06]: Danny's care, and said to him,
look, I told him the story and I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to stand in the way of his
using marijuana this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Jaffe said, no, no, don't do it in the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't do it in the treatment room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see this for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did smoke in the treatment room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And same thing, no problem, submarine
sandwich on the way home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of going to bed, he would go back
to school.
[SPEAKER_06]: And during, to make a long story short,
during the last year of his life,
[SPEAKER_06]: it made such a difference, not just to
Danny, but to the whole family.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I began to wonder, is this,
is there something to this forgotten
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_16]: Lester Grinspoon, as a father,
mourned the death of his son.
[SPEAKER_16]: As a professor at Harvard Medical School,
he began to look into the history of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: An Englishman by the name of W.B.
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Shaughnessy, who was working in
Calcutta, used it and treated some
[SPEAKER_06]: patients following what the indigenous use
was, and published a paper which created
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a stir in 1842 in Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the ancient civilizations of the East,
cannabis had been known for thousands of
[SPEAKER_16]: years.
[SPEAKER_16]: In India, it's a familiar harvest.
[SPEAKER_16]: Its use in medicine also has a long
history.
[SPEAKER_16]: Manuscripts, centuries old, contain the
secrets of Ayurvedic healing.
[SPEAKER_16]: In this clinic, prescriptions containing
cannabis are prepared on the premises.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the 1840s, a British commission sent to
investigate cannabis noted that it was an
[SPEAKER_16]: important part of Indian culture,
and to restrict it would cause hardship.
[SPEAKER_16]: In their report, they called it the poor
man's heaven, an affordable relief in hard
[SPEAKER_16]: times.
[SPEAKER_16]: In any city today in India, cannabis
drinks and milkshakes are available in the
[SPEAKER_16]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_16]: This group of friends is getting in the
mood for an important occasion.
[SPEAKER_16]: Today is the Festival of Colors.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the time of year to give thanks for
the crops that have been gathered in.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the temple, the priests act on behalf
of the deity.
[SPEAKER_16]: The range and brilliance of the colors
they shower on the participants represent
[SPEAKER_16]: the variety and richness of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_16]: Included in this bounty, cannabis is
simply a gift from the gods.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether of divine origin or not,
cannabis became of practical interest to
[SPEAKER_16]: the British Raj in the 1840s.
[SPEAKER_16]: Details of its use as medicine were
conveyed to the medical profession in
[SPEAKER_16]: England, where it was widely used.
[SPEAKER_16]: In London, the young Queen Victoria,
who suffered from muscle cramps,
[SPEAKER_16]: found cannabis brought soothing relief.
[SPEAKER_16]: Across the Atlantic, it became a folk
medicine, easing the hardships of pioneer
[SPEAKER_16]: life.
[SPEAKER_16]: But early in this century, everything
changed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily Murphy in Edmonton wrote The Black
Candle.
[SPEAKER_16]: Its theme, marijuana today, tomorrow the
opium den.
[SPEAKER_10]: Suddenly we find enhancer, it's
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the debate on why marijuana suddenly
became illegal is about a line long.
[SPEAKER_10]: One minister stands up and simply says,
we have a new drug on the prohibited drug
[SPEAKER_10]: schedule, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the extent of the debate.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the USA, Harry Anslinger, head of the
Narcotics Bureau, produced Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana was identified with the jazz
culture and its corrupting influences.
[SPEAKER_16]: Taking these grotesque scenes at face
value, Congress rushed marijuana onto the
[SPEAKER_16]: list of dangerous drugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: With added manpower and money,
the Bureau was now able to protect
[SPEAKER_16]: America's youth.
[SPEAKER_16]: Two generations later, Valerie Carell runs
the Women's Alliance for Medical
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana, or WAM, to supply medicine to
the sick.
[SPEAKER_16]: She wanted others to benefit as she had
done.
[SPEAKER_16]: On the coast of California, she lives in
Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hillary Black, who runs the Compassionate
Club in Vancouver, has come south to hear
[SPEAKER_16]: her story.
[SPEAKER_11]: As we were driving back after a long
afternoon in the hot springs, a plane
[SPEAKER_11]: began to fly toward us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We thought we might need to make an
emergency landing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We pulled off the side of the road,
but he simply made a quick turn around the
[SPEAKER_11]: lake and came back following us.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like the plane was harassing you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yes it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it turned out that he was.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was being playful, is what he said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, my girlfriend saw him in the rear
view mirror.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though it's a plane, you can't
hear it until it's really overhead or
[SPEAKER_11]: beyond you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the time I heard her scream,
or gasp, and looked up, the belly of the
[SPEAKER_11]: plane was here and our car lifted off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it rolled 365 feet and we were both
around from the car.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no!
[SPEAKER_11]: And it left me with a brain trauma and
grand mal epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes as many as five seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went through a long regime of many
different drugs and I was unable to find a
[SPEAKER_11]: medication that would control the
seizures.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I lived in this vacuum of a drug
stupor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really felt like I lived underwater.
[SPEAKER_11]: What ensued was a deliberate effort to try
to find an alternative.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, we didn't know of any.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I had still been receiving at that
time medical journals and periodicals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mike was reading through one and read
that laboratory-induced seizures in rats
[SPEAKER_11]: had been controlled with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we looked at each other and we
thought, this can this be?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is too, this would be too
simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we were first arrested here,
we were growing five plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And truthfully, I was stunned.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was the first person in the state of
California to challenge the law and
[SPEAKER_11]: medical necessity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing what I knew, I wasn't very well
going about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, I'm guilty of a crime.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shortly after our arrest, there was a
signature gathering to put a medical
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana initiative just to get the pulse
of Santa Cruz County, how people felt
[SPEAKER_11]: about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it won 77.1%.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought that meant public national
statement.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray!
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the first person in the United States
that can legally grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: A year and one month later, they showed up
and it came again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they took our plants and we were
livid.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we decided that at that time we would
file a suit against them and go completely
[SPEAKER_11]: public and make the statement that we were
going to start not only growing it again,
[SPEAKER_11]: but an organization to give it away to
teach people who are seriously ill with
[SPEAKER_11]: glaucoma, with epilepsy, with multiple
sclerosis for whom it works.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're getting together.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get together and we're
going to continue to use it.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're all sick of this weather.
[SPEAKER_16]: Leslie is Nathan's mother, one of the many
people Valerie supplies.
[SPEAKER_28]: Nathan's 17 now and he had a couple of
seizures when he was young, about six
[SPEAKER_28]: years old, and went on medication for two
years and didn't have any more seizures.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then on his 13th birthday,
he had another seizure.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then the nightmare began and the
seizures came more and more in frequency
[SPEAKER_28]: and we would try one medication and it
wouldn't have any effect on him.
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'd try another medication and there
was no stopping the seizures.
[SPEAKER_28]: They were increasing and increasing.
[SPEAKER_28]: When things would get really bad,
he would have a grand mal, he'd be up for
[SPEAKER_28]: an hour and then he'd fall down again and
have another grand mal.
[SPEAKER_28]: He would maybe bite his lip, maybe bite
his tongue, maybe smash his head on the
[SPEAKER_28]: way down and maybe be eating and choke on
his food.
[SPEAKER_28]: We wound up going to UCSF Epilepsy Center
when our local doctors or the neurologists
[SPEAKER_28]: in the area felt like there was nothing
else that they could do for him.
[SPEAKER_28]: So they basically said the only thing we
can think of doing to help him at this
[SPEAKER_28]: point is to actually separate the right
hand side of his brain from the left hand
[SPEAKER_28]: side, which is a rather large surgery.
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_28]: And they turned around to walk out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I said, no way, you're not walking out
of the room.
[SPEAKER_28]: He can't have a life like this anymore.
[SPEAKER_28]: He spoke about killing himself.
[SPEAKER_28]: And to hear your child say that he doesn't
want to live anymore, I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_28]: what that feels like.
[SPEAKER_28]: I used to visualize us all getting into a
car and just driving off the cliff
[SPEAKER_28]: together because I couldn't figure out any
other way to make the whole nightmare
[SPEAKER_28]: stop.
[SPEAKER_28]: Just prior to that, I had heard about Val
and medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we had just started cooking up in soy
milk with it and giving Nathan a little
[SPEAKER_28]: bit.
[SPEAKER_28]: And what we were finding right away was
that he was sleeping and his appetite was
[SPEAKER_28]: starting to return because some of the
side effects of the seizure medication are
[SPEAKER_28]: just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_28]: He wasn't eating.
[SPEAKER_28]: He wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you don't sleep and you don't eat,
you have more seizures.
[SPEAKER_28]: So it was like this vicious cycle that we
couldn't get off of with him.
[SPEAKER_28]: So when they said increase the medication,
I said thank you very much and hung up the
[SPEAKER_28]: phone.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I increased the milk.
[SPEAKER_28]: They called back again in two weeks and
said, how's he doing?
[SPEAKER_28]: I said, he's not having any seizures.
[SPEAKER_28]: They said, oh, good.
[SPEAKER_28]: That last increase in the medication must
have worked.
[SPEAKER_28]: I said, I never did it.
[SPEAKER_28]: I never did the last medication increase.
[SPEAKER_28]: I increased his milk.
[SPEAKER_28]: So they giggled.
[SPEAKER_28]: They thought that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_28]: And they wound up calling it mother's
milk.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have kept him on this milk now.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been almost two years that he has not
had any seizures.
[SPEAKER_28]: We feel strong enough to try and start
getting him off of some of the other
[SPEAKER_28]: medications.
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: The meeting of WAM members is an occasion
to establish community.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, with Proposition 215, Valerie Carell
has the support of the State of
[SPEAKER_16]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Californians who needed marijuana for
medical purposes had the right to use it
[SPEAKER_02]: and to obtain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that if it was recommended by a
physician and determined that someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: health required the use of marijuana for
alleviation of pain and suffering,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was a legal and permitted use of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wondering how the muffins are doing.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was thinking about typing up a little
survey, seeing how they're doing
[SPEAKER_23]: everything.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wondering if you guys were all
willing to fill that out for me so I can
[SPEAKER_28]: figure out what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: But under federal law, the growing and
distribution of marijuana still brings
[SPEAKER_16]: with it the risk of arrest and
imprisonment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Local support is no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: The City Council in Santa Cruz did pass a
resolution in support of the activities of
[SPEAKER_02]: WAM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we did so is because the
people of our community support this.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can grow enough in here to last all of
the people that you take care of for the
[SPEAKER_21]: whole year.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we do it, guaranteed for a
year.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as one can guarantee anything.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's all outdoor, which is far
superior.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's totally organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much marijuana growing outdoors is
pest-free, so we don't need to use
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that we do in our
organization is we're very stringent about
[SPEAKER_11]: our membership.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't maintain our squeaky clean
image, it can discredit the whole movement
[SPEAKER_08]: in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So every organization that's in this state
now has to have certain standards that
[SPEAKER_08]: they have to live up to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Suzie has an advanced and painful cancer.
[SPEAKER_20]: I am an incorporating member of WAM as an
organization.
[SPEAKER_20]: Signing the papers for incorporation and
seeing them come back accepted.
[SPEAKER_20]: For someone who has a fatal disease,
this was it.
[SPEAKER_20]: This was medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was the first.
[SPEAKER_20]: My thumb print is on the State of
California, the history of the United
[SPEAKER_20]: States.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's astounding.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sometimes surprises me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can drive a car, and I can run an
organization, and bring a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_11]: people and friends of like-mindedness and
spirit together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can do it because I use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't believe it either.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really couldn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first realized that it would
control my seizures, I didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not fully.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to, but I really couldn't fully
believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can do it myself.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first organization to ever do
this.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we come from such a really
compassionate place.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's incredibly inspiring for me.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys make my dream closer.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I can see it alive in material.
[SPEAKER_16]: With fresh inspiration from Santa Cruz,
Hillary is back in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm an organizer of the Compassion Club as
well as a member of it.
[SPEAKER_21]: The club consists of people from all parts
of society, all financial brackets.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have about 400 members now.
[SPEAKER_21]: And building.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we're registering people every
day.
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just curious, though.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I have actually osteoarthritis,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_16]: If I came in and asked you for some,
would you prescribe it?
[SPEAKER_21]: What we require is a document of
diagnosis, which is just something from a
[SPEAKER_21]: doctor that states what your medical
condition is.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if he were to simply sign a form
saying, yes, David has osteoarthritis,
[SPEAKER_16]: with nothing about what he recommends,
would that be sufficient for you?
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_21]: There are a lot of doctors that are very
fearful.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have had to just accept documents of
diagnosis for conditions that we know
[SPEAKER_21]: absolutely cannabis does help with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Greg has the muscle spasms of multiple
sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_16]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_16]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember the first time that you came into
the club?
[SPEAKER_21]: The thing that made you stop shaking the
most was just when Starr just put her
[SPEAKER_21]: hands on your shoulders.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's incredible that affectionate touch
can have that effect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: This way you don't shake as much,
Greg.
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it, baby?
[SPEAKER_18]: Greg.
[SPEAKER_18]: Greg, you got a good lunch.
[SPEAKER_25]: What a long drink.
[SPEAKER_25]: He's a good one.
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you happy?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually hard to find pot that's good
enough to really help him.
[SPEAKER_21]: We rolled a joint for him once that I
think had three kinds of really good pot,
[SPEAKER_21]: two kinds of hash, and a whole bunch of
oil on it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that actually completely stopped it
all.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana is versatile.
[SPEAKER_16]: It calms severe muscle spasms.
[SPEAKER_16]: And in glaucoma, it delays the onset of
blindness.
[SPEAKER_04]: My doctor said I'm lucky I still have
vision, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if it's marijuana or not,
but it's working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just do not say, OK, I'd find it good
for arthritis also and for sleeping and
[SPEAKER_04]: for many things.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a lot of research that we want to
do, but it all depends on having a
[SPEAKER_21]: consistent supply, which at this point we
don't because we're not growing for
[SPEAKER_21]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: So where do you get it?
[SPEAKER_21]: There is about 10 people that I've married
down to that I deal with, and they are
[SPEAKER_21]: excellent growers.
[SPEAKER_21]: It all works on a front base.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that they bring me the pot,
and I distribute it, and then I pay for
[SPEAKER_21]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all for the Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police in Vancouver have said they're not
going to bust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're going to leave them alone,
they need a supply from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't think they should have to
pay $3,200 a pound for something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hydroponic marijuana, if grown on
a big scale, you can grow it for the same
[SPEAKER_01]: amount as hydroponic tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they retail for $3 a pound.
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Wakeford is suing the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_16]: He needs a legal supply of an essential
medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact is it's been helpful in dealing
with the side effects from the AIDS drugs
[SPEAKER_15]: I was on.
[SPEAKER_15]: My drug regimen was so strict,
I had to be up at eight every morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't go to bed before midnight
because I had to dose at each time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which meant I could never sleep in or ever
go to bed early.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that went on for two years.
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll be pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: John Goodhue is Jim's doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to show you, for example,
what one of my patients who does use
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana and who basically has had a
tremendous improvement in his immune
[SPEAKER_09]: functioning since starting this treatment,
but could absolutely not tolerate the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Without marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now he takes, this one is called
Crixivander and Dinovir.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has to be taken every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people go, oh, three times a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_09]: He then has to take two of these,
which are called Xerit or D4T.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have to be taken close to every
12 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And taken with this other drug,
which is called 3TC, which is also taken
[SPEAKER_09]: twice a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually with food to prevent nausea.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've now got three doses without food,
two doses with food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also takes this drug, which is a
particularly nasty drug in terms of side
[SPEAKER_09]: effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is called Vitex or DDI.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, each and every one of
these drugs has side effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one, 3TC, not bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: D4T, not bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crixivan, DDI, tremendous nausea.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in many people, total loss of
appetite, especially with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smokable marijuana is so unique in that it
is so easy for the patient to control the
[SPEAKER_09]: administration of their own dose.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have two puffs of a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's controlled your nausea or if it
stimulates your appetite, great,
[SPEAKER_09]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, have another two puffs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So within minutes, you can have given
yourself the appropriate dose of
[SPEAKER_09]: medication.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that aspect, it's far superior to
anything else that I would have to offer
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have a joint before lunch.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have a joint before dinner.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I'm having a beautiful night,
I'll have a third joint between dinner and
[SPEAKER_15]: dessert.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I got to put 20 more pounds on
this scrawny little body.
[SPEAKER_16]: The mystery of marijuana lies in its
complexity.
[SPEAKER_16]: The synthesis of one component,
THC, forms the drug Marinal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody knows why marijuana works so well
as an anti-nausea agent and as an appetite
[SPEAKER_09]: stimulant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is evident when you look at the
clinical outcome when you try to use
[SPEAKER_09]: Navalon or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: The effects are prolonged.
[SPEAKER_09]: 12, 15, 18, 24 hours, people will remain
completely intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people find it extremely unpleasant,
the anxiety and the paranoia that goes
[SPEAKER_09]: along with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: All I remember is one experience of
Marinal that went on for seven hours of
[SPEAKER_15]: nausea, waves and waves of nausea and
puking.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, I've never put Marinal in
my body again, nor will I ever.
[SPEAKER_16]: Donald Abrams surprised the establishment
by proposing a study of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been trying since 1993 to conduct a
study or design a study to investigate
[SPEAKER_12]: whether smoking marijuana is useful in
patients with HIV infection and at the
[SPEAKER_12]: same time, whether it's safe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been difficult, certainly,
to obtain a legal source of marijuana and
[SPEAKER_12]: to get funding to conduct the study.
[SPEAKER_16]: Could this illegal drug be beneficial?
[SPEAKER_12]: The comments that we ultimately got were
comments that were concerned about why we
[SPEAKER_12]: would even consider studying such a toxic
substance.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was also one reviewer,
and these were going to be patients with
[SPEAKER_12]: AIDS wasting, who was concerned that if we
stimulated appetite and patients started
[SPEAKER_12]: to eat too much, they might develop high
blood fats and hardening of the arteries.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is not something that patients
with AIDS really have the luxury of
[SPEAKER_12]: worrying about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was concerned about whether my peers
that were reviewing this were really
[SPEAKER_12]: peers.
[SPEAKER_12]: For some reason, this emotional political
charge is very present and makes it very
[SPEAKER_12]: difficult for science to go on in the
midst of all that politics.
[SPEAKER_16]: Kent Berridge and Terry Robinson are
studying addiction, focusing on a chemical
[SPEAKER_16]: called dopamine.
[SPEAKER_16]: Its release in the brain measures the
importance of every pleasant stimulus.
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be food or sex or drugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Rats have the same dopamine system.
[SPEAKER_16]: Self-administered heart drugs release
dopamine, but they also change the brain.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cells in the dopamine system normally look
like this.
[SPEAKER_16]: But hard drugs cause them to grow,
become sensitized, and send an exaggerated
[SPEAKER_16]: message.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as we know, drugs like marijuana
don't produce this neurosensitization,
[SPEAKER_05]: which may account for why animals won't
readily self-administer PHC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might account for why people who use
marijuana really aren't characterized as
[SPEAKER_06]: compulsive drug takers or drug seekers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most sophisticated drug researchers now
believe that cannabis's place as a drug of
[SPEAKER_06]: addiction is down at the bottom of the
list with coffee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is a truly remarkably non-toxic
drug.
[SPEAKER_19]: Marijuana will take the place of a lot of
prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll take the place of Valium.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll take the place of Xanax.
[SPEAKER_19]: It will take the place of Tylenol,
Aspirin.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll leave migraines.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a world of good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like if I fail to not want dinner some
night, tired, or don't feel like really a
[SPEAKER_19]: dinner, my wife turns around and looks at
me, honey, maybe you better have a
[SPEAKER_19]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_19]: Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe you better have a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been terrific.
[SPEAKER_16]: To possess and grow marijuana is illegal,
as Terry Parker found out.
[SPEAKER_24]: The charge against me is with cultivation
and possession for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_24]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_24]: I developed epilepsy at four years of age.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was growing it because I simply,
with my budget, I cannot afford the price
[SPEAKER_24]: of marijuana as tree as it is today.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it's much more convenient for
myself to grow my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: At his trial, Terry was represented by
Aaron Harnett.
[SPEAKER_10]: We structured the case, both the Crown
Attorney and I, in such a way that we
[SPEAKER_10]: agreed with the obvious and spent our time
in a quasi-scientific inquiry,
[SPEAKER_10]: putting some of the best minds in the area
up on the stand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were educating ourselves as well as
the judge as the trial went on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Valerie was a tremendous witness.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was my good fortune to be able to
travel to Toronto and to testify in this
[SPEAKER_11]: most incredible case and really has...
Really a landmark case.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, truly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of its bearing on
constitutionality, which is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanted a remedy fashion that would help
a whole range of people who have a medical
[SPEAKER_10]: need for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the judge agreed with us and he
actually declared that law invalid for all
[SPEAKER_10]: of Canadians and tinkered with it a bit to
allow Terry and people like Terry to be
[SPEAKER_10]: able to possess and grow marijuana for
medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, Terry Parker can smoke a joint
legally.
[SPEAKER_16]: An illegal drug that makes legal history.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the federal government has since
appealed the verdict.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've relegated to the courts the
difficult policy decisions that parliament
[SPEAKER_10]: seems unwilling to tackle.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they can blame the courts and say,
well, it's those crazy judges who made it
[SPEAKER_10]: legal, not us, then that might get them
off the hook.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so long as sick people are being
stupidly prosecuted, then that is the
[SPEAKER_10]: court's role to step in and make sure it
stops.
[SPEAKER_16]: The unchanging official view of marijuana
conveniently obscures more serious
[SPEAKER_16]: problems.
[SPEAKER_16]: RCMP Constable Gil Putter on Vancouver's
east side.
[SPEAKER_22]: Anybody who abuses any substance has got
some serious underlying problems.
[SPEAKER_22]: It should be dealt with by a medical
practitioner, a counselor, an educator.
[SPEAKER_22]: But simply arresting, incarcerating,
punishing somebody is counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's only going to make the problem worse.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that's wishful thinking.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard to enforce an unreasonable law.
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of kids on the steps are smoking.
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of them might be smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this still a place where they're picked
up for that?
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly the officers that I work with
are not particularly concerned about
[SPEAKER_22]: anybody in possession of a small amount of
marijuana or consuming it for their own
[SPEAKER_22]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think where the concern is, is
trafficking to young people and possession
[SPEAKER_22]: of the schools, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: People that I encounter who used cannabis,
whether a small or large amount,
[SPEAKER_22]: are generally quite passive, easy to deal
with, and I really can't remember ever
[SPEAKER_22]: having a problem with anybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: Marijuana is not nearly as harmful as
alcohol, tobacco, or any of the opiates.
[SPEAKER_22]: Marijuana is, particularly for
recreational and medical uses,
[SPEAKER_22]: relatively harmless.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Santa Cruz, there's the same divide
between federal and local attitudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The implementation of Proposition 215 is
now challenged as being in violation of
[SPEAKER_02]: federal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have something of a crisis here in
California.
[SPEAKER_13]: They basically threatened us with license
revocation if in fact we recommended it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We went to court, and in fact the court
agreed that we really had the freedom to
[SPEAKER_13]: at least recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do what we can to follow
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: At times it's difficult because it doesn't
answer all the questions about who can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide marijuana, who can grow it,
how much can they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many unanswered questions,
but we will do our best to follow 215.
[SPEAKER_16]: Kathy got caught up in these unanswered
questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana relieves her arthritis.
[SPEAKER_26]: The cops wind up coming to my house,
and I had one little marijuana plant
[SPEAKER_26]: growing, and they busted me in my own
home.
[SPEAKER_26]: They took everything.
[SPEAKER_26]: They took my plant, they took my tray,
they took my marijuana, everything.
[SPEAKER_26]: Then I had to go to court, and this was
before I was involved in WAM, and they
[SPEAKER_26]: fined me.
[SPEAKER_26]: They were going to send me to diversion
which is a drug school where they tell you
[SPEAKER_26]: how bad you are, and they show you films
about drug use and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: And when I went to the hearing,
the judge looked at me, and you could see
[SPEAKER_26]: obvious deformity, and he looked at the DA
and said, well maybe she doesn't want
[SPEAKER_26]: diversion.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, there's, he said, nothing.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Santa Cruz, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Tulsa, Oklahoma, it's 92 years in jail.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Oklahoma City, people are gathering for
a rally to protest Will Foster's sentence.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like Kathy, he was using marijuana to ease
the pains of arthritis.
[SPEAKER_16]: The police raided his house looking for
amphetamines on a tip from a confidential
[SPEAKER_16]: informer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, he's a medical marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's not one of those people who's just
partying around, and they didn't even find
[SPEAKER_14]: any amphetamines.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a day Meg Foster will never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I put my hand on the doorknob to
disengage it, the door just exploded
[SPEAKER_03]: inward.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fell backwards onto my five-year-old
daughter and knocked her onto the floor,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was this very large man with no
badge dressed in what I think of as biker
[SPEAKER_03]: attire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harley-Davidson t-shirts, the high metal
boots, with a very large gun in my face
[SPEAKER_03]: and at my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It frightened me badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever been that scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea who these people were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my daughter is screaming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave my mommy alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_03]: They searched everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 60 plants in the basement,
and approximately half a dozen of them
[SPEAKER_03]: were about a foot tall, had really just
started to bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of them were saplings,
you know, two, three inches at the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted a plea bargain of 12 years in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Will gets 12 years in, then I get
five years in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I can take their deal and testify for
the state against him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems so unconscionable for me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like I would be betrayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody had to be here to raise these
children.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took their deal.
[SPEAKER_16]: Meg and Will agonized over their decision.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the only way for Meg to remain free,
to care for the children, was to testify
[SPEAKER_16]: against her husband.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Will refused the plea bargain and opted
for trial by jury.
[SPEAKER_16]: By an arbitrary decision of the court,
the evidence of medical necessity was
[SPEAKER_16]: disallowed.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was given a mandatory 92 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took him in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the last time I was with him,
when he wasn't behind a bar or behind a
[SPEAKER_03]: fence or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: In less than 30 seconds, my entire life
was ripped apart.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a long five-hour drive to see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 70 years for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 20 years for having that marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one in the presence of a child.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got two years for possession with
intent.
[SPEAKER_07]: They put you in prison hoping that your
family will forget about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your friends will forget about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get to see your kids grow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want people to have people that
care on them on the outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have more access to drugs in
here than I did on the outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went well.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to sign, go outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not my room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently they are, man, because you're
enforcing them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a job.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you think of, on one side,
all the DE agents, the district attorneys,
[SPEAKER_06]: the assistant district attorneys,
the people who build jails, who guard
[SPEAKER_06]: prisoners, there's a lot of personnel and
money involved in this now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: government has spent countless millions of
dollars trying to establish the toxicity
[SPEAKER_06]: which would justify this prohibition,
which has led to the arrest of 11 million
[SPEAKER_06]: mostly young Americans.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want them to stop harassing and jailing
and fining and brutalizing my sick
[SPEAKER_15]: brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_28]: For us, it was, there was no other choice.
[SPEAKER_28]: There just wasn't another choice.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the drugs that we're worrying
against have a significant advantage in
[SPEAKER_13]: decreasing suffering.
[SPEAKER_13]: And medical marijuana, which is very,
very safe, is one of the principal herbs
[SPEAKER_13]: that I ought to be able to use in order to
help my patients.
[SPEAKER_28]: You take a crock pot and mix up some green
stuff with some white stuff and you give
[SPEAKER_28]: it to him and suddenly he's not having
seizures, he's eating, he's laughing.
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe a little bit too much at first,
but he was laughing again.
[SPEAKER_20]: Your patients, we don't want to be
criminals.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want a safe supply.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just leave us alone and let us do it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Allow it to be what it is.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and then when you're finally
ingesting the medicine, you're also
[SPEAKER_21]: ingesting your own love for yourself in
many ways.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
