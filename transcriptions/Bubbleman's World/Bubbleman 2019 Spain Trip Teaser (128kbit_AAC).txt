[SPEAKER_01]: The madness of it all, here at Spannibus
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years of coming to Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only been here for maybe an hour and
a half and we're already in a VIP room
[SPEAKER_01]: with the old school Super Sativa Seed
Club, the SSS Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they've got the fire hash,
they've got the fire herb, they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: old school genetics that is a little bit
more exotic than what's available at most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the places you'll see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very special place to start
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are the OGs in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Skunkman Sam helped this
company start off by supplying them with a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of seeds that he had collected in
all the hash producing countries in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people like Skunkman Sam doing
that work because without that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have the building blocks that we
need to continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very important work that Sam did.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys helped continue it on and it is
now what it is in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: With so many different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably a hundred seed companies
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of all the love you've had for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've given this plant so much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then years later, I don't know if it's
30 or 40 years later, cannabis gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: almost three years extra with your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, I mean, if you weren't a
believer before and you see your own
[SPEAKER_03]: mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did I feel good about myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great to sit with you at one point
in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Martin created one of the like
longest standing bong companies and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, he's German.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bongs are just like of the utmost
ridiculous quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruhr bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruhr bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It proceeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David, who's got the big beard back
there, knows quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to meet my partner from
Whistler Technologies, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's kind of asking about the best hash
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the best yield is Dosy Dos crossed
with Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you going to have some legends in
the game?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the hash lovers will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's really about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were never the legends we were
celebrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're celebrating like real like ancient
legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a happy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just a super awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A brother from another mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he used to let me I used to be
right here selling bubble bags and he
[SPEAKER_01]: would never charge me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would be like, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep with your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hang around and wait for you
for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how you been brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know about this company Embark?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing what you did with your book
with all of the extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm building a lab, two of them in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very big ones for ultrasonic
bioethanol, hydrocarbons, CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash, dry sift, rosin and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you wrote the book, you know,
your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were you were part of the
inspiration for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been just bubble and dry sift,
but you've always been everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bee isn't all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually the logo of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the bee because I've never seen it
in which art.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do the bee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they selling that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got three more for sale right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know Flav?
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav421 is a serious collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen his glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's something different,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so when I get back home, can you
message me on Instagram?
So
[SPEAKER_00]: for those of you that have never been to a
Legends dinner, think of Legends of Pash
[SPEAKER_00]: as a set of bubble bags that goes to
events like the Cannabis Cup, goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: events like the Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we run all of that herb, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the people, through the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, my friends, are all the ninth
micron of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like for you to be a judge at Legends
of Pash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd be so honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I hate to do this to you guys,
but here's three more.

[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!
Woohoo!
