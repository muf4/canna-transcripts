[SPEAKER_00]: These are designed to push them out of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: TBJ's Anthony Lugg reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja, sensimina, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant often described as the healing
of the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for small farmers, the regulator of
the legal ganja industry, the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing Authority, CLA, is causing
headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: One such headache they point to is the fee
they're asked to pay just to start up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before being considered eligible for a
license, a ganja farm should be properly
[SPEAKER_02]: fenced and surveillance cameras must be
installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many small farmers, the cost to do so
is exorbitant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delana Sievwright is a director at the
Cannabis Licensing Authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fee isn't the only thing the
farmers are taking issue with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are of the view that the industry is
designed to favour big investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least one of those moneyed
investors has fired back, arguing that
[SPEAKER_02]: some local farmers have trust issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get into some heated discussions
sometimes with my RAS friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll say things like, well,
you know, you can't come and steal the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, no, we're all the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow so much herb in Jamaica
that all of a sudden your Jamaican friends
[SPEAKER_00]: can't smoke at all, well, send some over
to Canada or send some over to America or
[SPEAKER_00]: send some over to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that's what we want to happen
again, but we want it to happen legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which then takes us to banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local banks have shied away from doing
business with players in the ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: industry because they fear they will be
seen as engaging in money laundering and
[SPEAKER_02]: lose valuable business ties with US banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ganja farmers are questioning why
banks refuse to do business with them when
[SPEAKER_02]: they are the ones collecting on behalf of
the Cannabis Licensing Authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I can't understand,
but it is there for true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very complicated situation because
there are companies in Jamaica that are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the cannabis space that have
bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also many companies involved
in the legal cannabis space that do not
[SPEAKER_01]: have bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very sloppy situation and we want
it to be resolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, whatever happens in the United
States of America impacts what happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica and not just Jamaica, but the
world.
