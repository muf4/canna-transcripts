[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just heading down to the 420 gathering
down at the Vancouver Art Gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Running a little bit behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 8 o'clock in the morning and
apparently John's been down there since 7
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's been a free for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real hard to get a booth space but
I'm not worried personally because
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever John and I will be will be the
melt of dry sift and bubble hash and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that's going to attract all the right
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna head down there now and
we'll see you when we get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ciao for now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, easy, second and third will trap the
beast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Officer Man, what you want from me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Ease out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ease out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ease out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey you, dreadlock one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah right, we're trying to stop people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know respect the law when the law says
stop people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, doctor.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meditator John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got here down to the 420 festivities
with John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've set up our booth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 70 booths here and there's
gonna be a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got bowls, we've got hash,
we've got our everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our little booth set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's brought his medtainers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got just a few products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going overboard but it looks
like if we avoid the rains today it'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: a real nice day so stay tuned for some 420
celebrations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so we're here at the 420
celebration.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of people set up.
100
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars and up, 60 dollars per ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's gonna buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would turn it all into hash myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably about 20 grams of hash on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Freddie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Freddie's on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on and I just bumped into him
because of this dude behind us with big
[SPEAKER_02]: bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd bubble box the shit out of that,
wouldn't we, Freddie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, we would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how you doing doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent,

[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's rocking it out.

that I'm going to get them to repeat for
[SPEAKER_02]: the camera.

we're going to make our first batch of
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble within six months and then we're
going to practice for six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back here at 420 next year and
we're going to show them our bubble.

cakes.

[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh I know I know.

Georgia so we got like overnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like that's alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it's like dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre 420 session going down hard at the
back of the medtainer fresh Heddy's booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah grilled cheeses.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys know what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to film this because it was the
Javadoo first place piece at the great
[SPEAKER_02]: gardener one with the bar hash that he has
right here and this is the little piece
[SPEAKER_02]: that he got at Barcelona so we're gonna
bring that hash with him right here right
[SPEAKER_02]: now 420 Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Star.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird not being in a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feels like there's going to be a tumbler
behind you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They let me out from time to time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very often though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get away.
[SPEAKER_08]: The timing is right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get away for 8 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste of that was unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like a candy dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: GG Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: GG Plus is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was.
[SPEAKER_02]: The take hits that big very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be on the ground dying right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was hitting it I thought all this was
going to get rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this small pipe has a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really digging these small concentrate
pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still going hard here at 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: First up Mothership Taurus.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. David Allen just showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing an interview with
Dr. David Allen later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe tomorrow after the noise subsides
but this guy right here has an incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of information about the
endocannabinoid system and we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be sharing it with you on bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as many of you know and if you don't
you really should, Mark was arrested on
[SPEAKER_09]: Canadian soil by American police with the
Drug Enforcement Administration to face
[SPEAKER_09]: life in U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: prison for his mission to legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though he ran for office and paid
his taxes and never left Canada and he was
[SPEAKER_09]: recognized by all the media's 60 minutes
CNN, Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone knew what he was doing but he
never went to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: and he faced death in prison in America
for his mission to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now he's finishing his last
three months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three months until Mark Emery ends his
prison sentence and comes home.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark Emery the Prince of Pot will be home
this summer and in the time he's been away
[SPEAKER_09]: the Harper government has put you in more
harm's way than you may even know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mandatory minimums, getting rid of
personal gardens under the medical laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: So much more harm has been done by Harper
than we can even comprehend.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when Mark comes home I promise you
that he and I and all of you I hope will
[SPEAKER_09]: join together for our political revenge
and get ahead of America, legalize it
[SPEAKER_09]: federally here, legalize it also
throughout North America, set examples for
[SPEAKER_09]: the world to follow so no one ever goes to
prison for pot again.
[SPEAKER_09]: 420 is a day to celebrate our culture,
celebrate our music, our art, our symbols,
[SPEAKER_09]: our language, our rituals and history.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have so much to celebrate here with a
life-saving world-changing plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet we must protest prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: We must remind the world that every person
here today faces prison under the laws
[SPEAKER_09]: that do still exist even though we get
days like this to have fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: So celebrate cannabis but protest
prohibition, join Sensible BC so we can
[SPEAKER_09]: change the laws here in our province and
set an example for the rest of Canada to
[SPEAKER_09]: organize, get inspired, get rid of the
Harper Conservatives and get marijuana
[SPEAKER_09]: legal here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please support the booths and the
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to 420Vancouver.com and hashtag your
photos 420Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on down to Canada's culture and we'll
see Mark here at the art gallery this
[SPEAKER_09]: summer for his welcome home celebration.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it up for Jody Emory.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just about then I started to
wonder, what's it like to be a hippie for
[SPEAKER_14]: the day?
[SPEAKER_14]: So we picked up a young bunch of South
Pacific.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, he went rolling down that highway
6 tonight.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he told me he was headed down for
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that I could share his smoke and drink
his wine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm a hippie for today, Martha dear.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a hippie for today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you fear Martha?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know that I am strong and I
won't be one for long.
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides, I don't like wine as much as
beer.
[SPEAKER_14]: He rolled up a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_14]: He called it a roofer.
[SPEAKER_14]: He lit it up and he said, I got my own
brand of X4 day in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you son.
[SPEAKER_14]: But by then the tab was filling up with
smoke.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was white lines on the highway.
[SPEAKER_14]: White lines on all the sand.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was white lines on the roadside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like there's white lines in my brain.
[SPEAKER_14]: My head is starting to feel a little kind
of fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, what the hell you think you're
smoking in my truck, boy?
[SPEAKER_14]: He said he found this plant growing down
by the roadside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it felt good to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I said, what the fuck, boy?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a hippie for today, Martha dear.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a hippie for today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you fear Martha?
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't see the other side of life,
semi-trailer ride, well then you just
[SPEAKER_14]: ain't a goddamn man.
[SPEAKER_14]: The streets ain't goddamn clear to carve
around.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he told me he needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_14]: He named some girls down in Mississauga.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said free love will make me feel just
right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I told him I had to be in Hamilton by the
next morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I reckon we could stop there for the
night.
[SPEAKER_14]: And them girls were pleased as bitches
just to see us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they said, come on in boys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a little talk or two.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then later Harvey and Lloyd were
finished with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: They showed us just what them hippie women
do.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was white lines on the bedside.
[SPEAKER_14]: White lines in the sky.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was white lines on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: They made red lines in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was feeling right as a ray in the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a double action to my eye but free.
[SPEAKER_14]: As I left my buddy standing down by the
roadside, got to thinking, what the hell's
[SPEAKER_14]: become of me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know my life's been traveling out
on the highway.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Martha, you're as sweet as you can
get.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm thinking it's just great to be a
trucker as I smoke another hippie
[SPEAKER_14]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Juan's got some bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to beat us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bubble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're rocking sublimator hits a bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're jacking stage power, thanks to Adam
and his lovely wares as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jacking stage power.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for the bonus you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll let you do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw some in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, throw some in for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we hit the sublimator though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push some of that into the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need a dabber?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just bumped into my buddy Juan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's jacking stage power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a sublimator plugged in right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess we're about to take a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thanks to the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uno, dos, tres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that'd be dribbling there a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's continue down the road
and see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start off by making fun of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm such a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, look at my 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put my... Cookies, anybody want the
cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, do you think he needs cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: He put 420 on his window and it's 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put it backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't need no stinking cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've got Barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hold it or hide it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pocket it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Away it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going up to the room for the view of
all of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so we just walked through the
lobby.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go up to the 10th floor
here and check out this view from the 450
[SPEAKER_15]: room.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to fix the sign now.
[SPEAKER_15]: 420.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get my 450.
[SPEAKER_15]: I looked up at it and I was like,
I don't know, dude, it looks fine to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been like an hour.
[SPEAKER_15]: But why is it 450?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go this way.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was feeling it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, although we are in Denver... I'm
surprised it was that... Did you book this
[SPEAKER_15]: a while ago or last minute?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this was in like a week.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing they had the room facing
the... 10-05 if you want to know for
[SPEAKER_15]: future references.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: What a great little room.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get that white balance organized.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'll let you get by.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get this chair out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that incredible, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Vancouver 420 at about 335 PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than an hour away from 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be 10,000 plus people down
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the fact that it's you guys,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you have a fucking room up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and exactly, I kind of didn't want
to be the guy to beg you to come up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sign was just like... It was the
sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly you need to go back up to your
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you need a fucking sign to show
you how badly you need to go up to your
[SPEAKER_02]: room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, there's a sign on your door,
on your window, and it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's hone in on the famous
cannabis activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we've got Jody, Emery, Marijuana Man,
and Daniel Larson, and John Conroy with
[SPEAKER_02]: his wife, and a bunch more people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember her name's Sherry.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_15]: this camera's muddy.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the Fresh Hatties booth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Guys, tonight's definitely backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're at the Vancouver Seed
Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the place where people ask me
where they can buy the Great Gardener gear
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got the seed bombs, even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they brought us seed bombs,
so we're having those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Great Gardener stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's double-sided.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, flip it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Atomic, host of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan's still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all the old guys like Solar Warrior.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ice, teas, lemonade, cookies, and
brownies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six items, $20.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mix and match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody in Canada is going to prison and
saying goodbye to their babies and their
[SPEAKER_01]: wife and their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the war goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget it, because you're here
to celebrate, but many people like my
[SPEAKER_01]: husband, Mark Emery, are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many others are behind bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year, this year,
[SPEAKER_07]: local dispensaries have helped out with
the kickdown.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got thousands of quality jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, bubba man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to Mother Nature for shining on us
here in 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it up for the Vancouver police who do
not arrest anybody for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And without any further ado, we're going
to get these ceremonies underway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sing it with me if you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: The words are over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to make a path starting about
right here that goes off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And spread out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spread out this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spread out that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a path right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a path.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then make another path that goes off
in that direction and goes off in that
[SPEAKER_06]: direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason we're going to do this is
it's easier to get you the free weed if
[SPEAKER_06]: you make a path.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want free weed to be thrown at
your head, make a path.
[SPEAKER_06]: One that goes that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: One that goes that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone should be out walking the path so
that it's for sure being made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get like a volunteer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Bert?
[SPEAKER_06]: He usually does a good job at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bert!
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you, Bert?
[SPEAKER_06]: But the buds are going to kick your butt.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a tremendous good marijuana
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Jeremiah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you walk that way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to walk that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Jeremiah's walking that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know what a tee looks like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And make sure you can walk far all the way
to the end there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can get pot thrown at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can instruct the Bigton BC girls not to
throw marijuana at anybody who's standing
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want marijuana thrown at your
head, sit your ass down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once the ladies all have like a
handfuls of buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you ready to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, start walking the path so that we
can get you all distributed far and wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to get you to the edges of the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those people down there who are sitting
down get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those people down there who are
sitting down get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Free joints!
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Free joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Smoke!
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, blood clots!
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_03]: 420 in Vancouver!
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, brother.
Woo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420!
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 420, brother!
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Marijuana Man in the house!
[SPEAKER_03]: Here at 420, man!
Woo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking nice to see!
[SPEAKER_02]: Battery's running out, but you get the
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: People watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so John and I just bumped into
this gentleman who's making this limonene
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing an extraction with no chemical
solvents whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's producing a shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wildly has a bit of a smell like the
limonene, which is a terpene that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: find in campus, in fact, as well as
oranges and grapefruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take some photos of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a session maybe next
Pop Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to have a session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll show you guys more about this,
and we'll talk about it and see what you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here at my booth with
Matt and Horatio, the guy who's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: these shatters with limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dabbing the dry sift at 420.
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_13]: He's taking a dab with the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_13]: 420 dabs with the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hibbidi hobbidi ho.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we say.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey ho, hi ho, hey hi ho ho.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 450!
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 450!
[SPEAKER_03]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho.
Hit that bowl.
