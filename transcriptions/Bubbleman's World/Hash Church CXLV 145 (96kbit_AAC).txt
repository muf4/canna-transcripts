[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, welcome to episode 145 of Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Bubbleman's world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am going to send out the links here and
see if we can't get going.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Block that, send this, send that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everyone's having a great day
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely gonna do a nice little church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I had a Facebook link.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, here we go, here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom and boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I mentioned, we got Etienne out this
week as well as Todd.
[SPEAKER_08]: Etienne's computer has blown up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, hopefully those guys are having
a good weekend, a good Sunday,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm sure we'll end up seeing them
again one of these days soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, I'm going to send out the
links to, oh, let's see, we want to send
[SPEAKER_08]: it out to Chimera.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to send it out to Pita.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Peter in the room already as well
as Indra.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Peter?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing great, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to have you here, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about on time, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you told me to come at nine,
so you're ready now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Indra as well in the room,
our resident oil maker and Mr. John
[SPEAKER_08]: Burfellow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, our resident all around good guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what to call John other
than over for a session.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Stunk Man Sam is in the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with all
of these guys that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, I'll kind of give you a little bit
of a little download on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Peter, Peter is has come to us,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I hooked up through Peter from I'm
not sure if it's a colleague or a friend
[SPEAKER_08]: or both Nate, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: A colleague, is he?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nathan is our head of IT and he's kind of
helping us spread the word on the
[SPEAKER_04]: Internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So well, he's doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter has come to us from Soil Balance Pro
and he's going to be talking to us today
[SPEAKER_08]: about we had a really great conversation
the other day just in regards to living
[SPEAKER_08]: soils and the bacterias and the different
strains that Peter calls givers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the ones that are going to
produce the most sort of symbiotic
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I figured because he was talking about
one of the things that their company talks
[SPEAKER_08]: about is raising the levels of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was something that was of interest to
us as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're always talking about terpenes over
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the hottest conversations
these days on a lot of these shows that
[SPEAKER_08]: happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, Tony starting it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, even prior to Tony, we had Kay
really into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way prior to Kay, we had Stunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first person I ever heard talk
about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was, God, it has to be back down in
2001, 2000 and maybe two.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been a long developing
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Tony's excited to get in the room
today to discuss terpenes as well as
[SPEAKER_08]: living soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, welcome D420K and Stunk Man Sam
to the room as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy belated Canada Day to everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Cannabis Day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was more of a Canada Day for me,
I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't gone to Cannabis Day,
I have to admit, in many years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to go all the time for July 1st and
go do the little gathering and puff mad
[SPEAKER_08]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess this year the art gallery
pulled a move on us and they were like a
[SPEAKER_08]: month before they said that there was a
children's event happening that they
[SPEAKER_08]: booked for the same day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dana Larson and the rest of the
activists that organized that event,
[SPEAKER_08]: they were like, man, we can't do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't go and have a giant smoke-a-thon
at a children's festival.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hats off to Dana and all of those
activists that made that decision showing
[SPEAKER_08]: that they don't have to be so stubborn and
that they can easily move on to the next
[SPEAKER_08]: venue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about the people and the event,
I think, more than the venue anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a chance to make it to the
Canada Day yesterday, but it looks like it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a fantastic event.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were down at the old train station
there down in Vancouver, Main and
[SPEAKER_06]: Terminal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a live event.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like quite a few people showed
up because I kind of watched it,
[SPEAKER_06]: viewed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a chance to get out of the
home kind of type deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a busy, busy day, but it looks like
everybody enjoyed themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Canada had a happy 150.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, why don't, Peter, would you like to
start and give us a little lowdown on how
[SPEAKER_08]: you kind of got into this soil,
bacteria, you know, kind of focus that
[SPEAKER_08]: you've been focused on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm 39 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was 19, I was living in Southern
California and I was working outside of a
[SPEAKER_04]: hotel and I met these two gentlemen that
were talking about facilitating,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cosmic energy into the plants so
that the plants would have super high
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, they would kind of elevate
our species.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking about what's called
biodynamic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just kind of like, wow,
you know, when you're that age,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're kind of trying to figure out what
you want to do with your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just was like, that's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm tuned into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make the food better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, I want to increase nutrient
density so that, you know, people can just
[SPEAKER_04]: elevate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of felt right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it made sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so I started studying sustainable
agriculture and I studied soil physics,
[SPEAKER_04]: soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last part to that equation was the
soil biology, the life that's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did was I started applying the
practices of the fertilization and the
[SPEAKER_04]: macro micronutrients and the canine
exchange capacity and working with the pH
[SPEAKER_04]: and working with paramagnetism and working
with the energetic frequencies that come
[SPEAKER_04]: from biodynamics, but the life was
missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we were having was, you know,
we were putting all these good things in
[SPEAKER_04]: there and we needed something to kind of
tie it all in, you know, kind of like the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil's digestive system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did was I went out and back
then, you know, this was like in 97,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of people really cared about
organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sustainable agriculture wasn't really a
topic of conversation back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I, you guys remember you're in
that space, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, what ended up happening was,
you know, you would talk to somebody about
[SPEAKER_04]: organic food or nutrient dense food and
they're like, why are we here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, uh, so anyways, to make kind of a
really long story short, um, I started
[SPEAKER_04]: researching and trying to find top
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this was like 18, 19 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found, uh, multiple guys back then
the industry was kind of small,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like this industry is the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just starting to really bloom,
but I ended up meeting, uh, some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: best world-class high level
microbiologists in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys were kind of like the
microorganisms that they were trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: create.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were givers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they understood that there was going
to be this, this, um, uh, evolution of
[SPEAKER_04]: organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they saw these guys, these,
these organic growers struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, Hey man, you know,
um, these guys are trying to do the right
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to work with nature and
earth, but they don't have the right
[SPEAKER_04]: tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of the tools are there for them
to, to be able to cultivate, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: without a lot of the health issues that
they were facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so way back then, these scientists,
these microbiologists were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey man, we're, we're creating organic
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're creating, you know, and these were
guys that were creating major stuff for
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these guys were petitioned to do
projects by, you know, Australia,
[SPEAKER_04]: the United States, like they were,
they were helping mostly with plant
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they said, we need, we need to put
something together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to come together as a group,
kind of like what, what you guys are doing
[SPEAKER_04]: and what this industry is doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to come together collectively to
support, uh, these stewards of our lands,
[SPEAKER_04]: these microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when I hooked up with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was on the whole other end of,
of, of, of, you know, the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was more into the fertilization and the
biodynamic element.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started to learn from these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they embraced me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, you know, really beautiful
giving human beings and, um, very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they, they taught me a lot about
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, you know, I wasn't a microbiologist
by trade, so they've kind of cultivated me
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years and, and helped me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really understand, um, how important it is
to add the light to the soil, to make
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that you guys are doing,
you growers, um, that much more,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, tuned into the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of the things that,
that we can talk about with regards to the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll kind of shut up now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get rolling and stuff, so.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glad you're giving us a little breakdown
on what you're about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, uh, no, it's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely where I want the
conversation to lead today and get a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit more into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: To these living soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I started growing, uh,
back in the late eighties and it was
[SPEAKER_08]: really all about, at that point,
people were trying, were blowing up this
[SPEAKER_08]: hydroponic thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't start growing hydroponically
personally, but it was, it might as well
[SPEAKER_08]: been because it's these living earth,
not living soils, quite the opposite
[SPEAKER_08]: soilless soils, soilless mixtures that are
like, it's an inert material that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might change the pH a little bit,
but it's not a living, uh, breathing
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just this dead soil that you kind of get
the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you grow a few crops out of it,
you're like, I wonder why I'm growing
[SPEAKER_08]: sixes instead of tens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it gets to that point of like,
are you giving the plant what it needs to
[SPEAKER_08]: express itself?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's, that's why I found what you
were saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always like my spider sense always sort
of peeks out when I hear anyone claiming,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, to be able to manipulate
terpene, um, content with, with,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like, uh, you know, there was a
product years ago that Ramo was using
[SPEAKER_08]: called the turpinator.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just like, Oh, I don't know
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, no, man, it's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: You poured on the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sorta, I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the name itself is throwing me
off, but, uh, you guys were a little
[SPEAKER_08]: different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not really claiming that you're,
you know, using a certain product to
[SPEAKER_08]: manipulate levels as much as to creating
perfect balance to create exceptional
[SPEAKER_08]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a little bit different than
saying, Oh, we're, you know, manipulating
[SPEAKER_08]: the, uh, the hydro, the, the terpene
content of the plant inside the trichomes
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to we're producing, uh,
you know, a symbiotic relationship
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout this plant and soil that allows
for it to express, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least from the tests that I saw you
guys do, uh, they were substantially
[SPEAKER_08]: higher in terpene content than the ones
that, uh, obviously we're not grown that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, the, the, see, we've just kind of
come into an awareness right now where
[SPEAKER_04]: people are understanding how terpenes are
even produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people actually know exactly what
that compound within the trichome,
[SPEAKER_04]: how, how it's created.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it's very fortuitous that right
now, the, uh, the Netherlands Institute of
[SPEAKER_04]: Ecology, uh, they know a thing or two
about growing grass out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got, we've got one of their most
exceptional growers in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, um, the Netherlands Institute of
Ecology came out with this article
[SPEAKER_04]: recently that said the world's most spoken
language is terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they're saying is, um,
and I'll actually read it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, um, it says microorganisms
communicate with each other and the rest
[SPEAKER_04]: of the world through smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're small, smells are a good way
to stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: A team of researchers led by the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology has
[SPEAKER_04]: demonstrated for the first time that two
different types of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria and fungi, use fragrances known
as terpenes to hold conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that it's, well,
this is a quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, no way is that limited to
terpenes at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quorum sensing is how bacteria
communicates and it's through all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals and it's not limited to
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes is just a very, very small
fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a sort of a field called chemical
ecology, which studies basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: insects and how they use chemicals as
different signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like beetles and whatnot and ants
and all those little creepy crawly insects
[SPEAKER_01]: all communicate by chemical emissions
through their anus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out it like leaves a trail
for those who are coming behind to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that they're going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like the breadcrumbs that trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like eating chipotle with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it's pretty obvious that
organically biodynamically grown tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, fruits have a higher terpene
content, more flavor, more smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, in general, I would say that's
obviously true with cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll also usually grow more with
really good, rich soil, organic biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow not only more roots,
but really a lot of the really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really tiny, fine roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a mat of tiny, fine roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the energy to produce all
these terpenes comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so think about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of an interesting concept
that was communicated to me recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so when we sweat, our bacteria creates
an odor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are drawn to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are repelled by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in the same way we're communicating to
our plants, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys as growers, you guys feel
definitely like an energetic, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: communication with your plant,
but there's also, you know, in this
[SPEAKER_04]: reality, a physical type of communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that's happening through the
transfer of biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the plants, uh, terpenes are,
you know, hydrocarbon that's lighter than
[SPEAKER_04]: air, that's going into your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, your, your own communication is,
is, is transferring to that plant with,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a lot of these smells, this,
this terpene molecule, this hydrocarbon,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, that's lighter than air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you think about the fact that
you're tuning into your plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel like you're tuning into your
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you really are not only on an
energetic level, but a biological one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so that's, that's something that,
uh, has really just impacted me when you
[SPEAKER_04]: think about the fact that could a plant
actually tune in to create the type of
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine that we need according to our own
biology.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have definitely had this concept and
thought years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: At first, I thought it was a form of
cognitive dissonance that people's egos
[SPEAKER_08]: were so attracted to what they themselves
produced and grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just always like, Oh,
my gosh, it's the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody can touch my shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to the point where I,
I wondered like, is there a relationship
[SPEAKER_08]: going on where these plants are producing
these resin glands in congruence with us
[SPEAKER_08]: being around them constantly, the more
time you spend with your plants,
[SPEAKER_08]: the more time you're touching and feeling
and moving them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always thought of it myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very psychedelic thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not one that I, that every sort of
very hardcore staunch, maybe scientists
[SPEAKER_08]: that needs proof in every aspect of what
they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I E I see you smiling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark's got Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it's, it's, it's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think, uh, it's an interesting
concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we used to grow plants up along a
river bed on an old horse trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every morning, um, my wife at the time
and I would go up and she was pregnant and
[SPEAKER_02]: we would sit in the plants for a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would bring my sitar and my 12 string up
there and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my friends told us that in the
morning, when we first went there,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants are all reaching up very high
because we grew them under trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the time we got done two hours
later, the plants all lean towards us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, I used to have some pictures,
these pests all lean over to the center
[SPEAKER_02]: where Annie and I were sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we left, they would straight back
up and go towards the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always felt that, uh, they leaned
towards us because we were dispensing
[SPEAKER_02]: something that they wanted to have
vibrationally by any chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you growing South Indian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say again, by any chance were you growing
Kerala South Indian weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why they wanted to hear the
music better.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we grew in India, but we grew in
Bangalore, but the plants never got over
[SPEAKER_02]: two and a half or three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just started flowering from the
second set of leaves and just became one
[SPEAKER_02]: two foot long bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could never get them to grow very big
there, but that was in San Diego where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine, uh, his name is Bruce
Perlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a big industrial hemp grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, actually back in the nineties,
uh, they, they called him the king of pot
[SPEAKER_04]: because he, uh, was longer than a ton of
it through San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we were having a conversation
recently and he said that Peter,
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that if you take a cannabis seed
and you put it in your mouth and you allow
[SPEAKER_04]: your saliva to kind of coat the seed
again, I don't know if this is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just what he told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you take that seed and you allow the
biology of your own body to, to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: penetrate it and absorb within the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you plant it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant will produce, the medicines and
the oils and the things and the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: that your body is either lacking or that
is necessary to, to heal you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got to be pretty high to
believe that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right at home at hash church,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right at home at hash church with
all the rest of us high brothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, who's to say, who's to not say,
I guess it's a, uh, a scientific,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, experiment for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has an order and the borders
are ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you put a seed in your mouth,
you can be sure that somewhere along
[SPEAKER_02]: there, some of your DNA is getting
transferred to that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they find DNA in this crazy,
these places, that's the police
[SPEAKER_02]: department.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll, they'll, they'll tell you just
how crazy that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, and they recover it from all
kinds of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that there could be a
penetration into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, does it really,
uh, affect that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you get into the area of,
well, does the emotion of love affect
[SPEAKER_02]: these things?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's getting into Imoto Masura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a seed, for example, can pass right
through a human digestive system or birds
[SPEAKER_00]: and still be viable.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure many a bird have helped crack
many a seed all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if, does that mean most
of the weed out there is birdy?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but look at all the shit seeds go
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's for real.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are, uh, they are protecting the most
delicate of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing sometimes when you crack like
a 20 plus year old seed and it's just
[SPEAKER_08]: like, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It just grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years and I still got 96% with some
varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're, you're the man, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, I'm not going to pretend
that I got 96%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, uh, nine percent, but other
varieties, I got more like 9% also,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of my better ones, 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually shocked and surprised me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty 26 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years old, 96% germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have one 33 year old seed crack
out of two dozen and it's sitting outside
[SPEAKER_02]: the front door in the sun right now and
it's an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other plants that are around it are
all much taller than it, but I was very
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is green beyond green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is deepest emerald.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, uh, what about, um,
the idea of potentially seeds even lasting
[SPEAKER_08]: longer when grown with plants that have
these beneficial microbials and bacterias?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you grow a plant to its ultimate
potential, the way you would do,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say an heirloom organic tomato,
uh, your, your, your package is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be longer lasting and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the other thing you can do is instead
of making seeds in five weeks from
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, uh, what you do is you make
it over a 10 week period, wait until the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds practically rattle in the,
in the calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that produces a much healthier
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, when you take seeds a little
bit early, they can be grayish or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes just the base near the obsession
layer where they're joining the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower, uh, you'll see it's wider than
the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if the seed truly, truly finishes,
it's, it's dark and it's the same color
[SPEAKER_00]: from the tip to the butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of our clients with regards to
germination percentages, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys would be interested in that with
the biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted also preface to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you guys having me on
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I'm so grateful to work with good
growers and it's just something that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been so passionate about for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys for the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, so one of our clients that was
using the biology mixed in with the seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, they were getting you know,
maybe, maybe nine or 10% of their seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: were not germinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just the case with all of the
seeds that they, that they had
[SPEAKER_04]: historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was a client that had been
specializing in seeds for the last 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they added the biology, the correct
biology, the germination percentages not
[SPEAKER_04]: only went up by about six to 7%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from like, I think it was 89% to 96%
germination rate, which was pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were able to germinate 96% of
their seeds consistently with their
[SPEAKER_04]: correct life on the, on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of seeds were these?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, these were, uh, tall fescue grass
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a huge company that sells a lot
of seed, um, nationally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 10% is a serious number when you're
rocking metric tons of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, but what, what was cool was the
tall fescue seed that they had tested was
[SPEAKER_04]: normally germinating in 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we circumvented that by three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so we were at seven days germination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quicker and more efficient.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's funny that we're coming
around to this, as Sam said earlier,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like, it kind of makes sense that if
you grow that heirloom tomato organically,
[SPEAKER_08]: biologically, like living soils,
the whole nine yards, it expresses itself
[SPEAKER_08]: greater.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, it's why when we taste them,
we're like, Oh, this tastes so good
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to these tomatoes that have come
from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that almost they look like a tomato,
they just don't have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least if you're used to actually
tasting heirloom tomatoes, which I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that, uh, I strongly
believe in organic, uh, biodynamic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taught in 1972 at the, uh,
Santa Cruz university, uh, Alan Chadwick
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I still keep those principles
close to my heart and, uh, I prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis that way.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I'm, listen, when I first
met Sam and smoked his product,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, I, I thought that I wasn't quite
sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, okay, this guy's on another level
because he's doing things that other
[SPEAKER_08]: people, not only are they not doing,
they don't even have a fucking clue that
[SPEAKER_08]: that is a reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just over here, you know,
raising the bar while everyone else is
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of playing with their marbles.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first smoked his product and I,
of course it's going to sound like a
[SPEAKER_08]: story, but I'm telling you, Peter,
it was shocking how strong it was
[SPEAKER_08]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it shocked me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It almost knocked me off my feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, mildly, I was mildly scared in
my head sitting in this man's living room,
[SPEAKER_08]: who I looked up to and didn't want to like
pass out and shit myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and then he gave, and then he gave
me like 40 more hits trying to kill me.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I'll see what this kid's made
of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if there's something to be said with
proper biodynamic, biodynamic growing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also breeding for what he wants.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not just taking other people's plants
and being like, Oh yeah, this one's got,
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going in and he's breathing
specifically what he wants and how he
[SPEAKER_08]: wants it to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all of that put together puts Sam
on a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just lucky in that I had suspected
for several decades that the terpenes were
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for potentiating and modifying
the effects of THC and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally proved it in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that happened, it really
changed my picture of what was important
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, because I had focused on the
cannabinoids and we developed single
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid varieties for, you know,
the top 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I realized it's terpenes that are
really creating most of the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different kinds of effects that people
really love from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like it up and speedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like it knock you in your
face, couch lock, narcotic, physical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have the ability to breed what
you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll tell you, it shocked me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to lie, I don't see much of
that since.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's got some of that going on with his
little mixtures and creations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But since Sam, there's just been very few
people to put a 10 in my bowl that's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was grown perfectly, it was bred
perfectly, it was harvested perfectly,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was cured perfectly, it was processed
perfectly, and then smoked perfectly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on that note...
[SPEAKER_08]: Bomb rip?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be one bomb rip and I'm heading to
Lynn Valley to go hiking with my honey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to go hike the Lynn Canyon
Falls.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to go jump off the falls or
what?
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get hot enough, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my 15 year old daughter did it last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're putting it on me now pretty much
then, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, dude, fuck that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: People die there all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hang out in puff bowls and watch the
kids do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was it we were at, Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the falls we were looking at,
people were jumping off?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, that was the popcorn one you have
to jump off because you've already jumped
[SPEAKER_08]: off the 80 footer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one was like 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other ones under the bridge and you'll
see them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sliding off of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go there and you think it's nothing
because local kids that are like 12 have
[SPEAKER_08]: been doing it their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you start reading the little
plaques that are all around that say,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, on this date, this person died and
this person over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's even a woman who died sunbathing
at Lynn Valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: A giant boulder the size of a house
cracked off the mountain and literally
[SPEAKER_08]: landed right on her.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't even ever move the boulder.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just slapped a plaque right on that
boulder and called it a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you sunbathing is dangerous,
but not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's why all the kids when you
go there and you're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't be jumping off there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll say, well, you should be
careful of standing here because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: dangerous too.
[SPEAKER_08]: She got squished.
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't squish well.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, she's not rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by no mean am I trying to downplay
this poor woman's death, but holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, she got stoned.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mark, by any chance, did you go to the
ICRS meeting in Canada last week?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in touch with Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Natasha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told I'm going to get a phone call
from John McPartlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it was a great meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just saw stuff that was on the
web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see John's new paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you send it to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, Sam, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I'm supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called models of cannabis taxonomy,
cultural bias and conflicts between
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific and vernacular names.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, don't use strains amongst
other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardly knew.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have gone to Montreal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a bit of a I wasn't paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden, I see all my friends in
Montreal at this epic event and I spaced
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks really good, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the posters.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got sent some good posters.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I'm allowed to share them
either, but there were some good ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chimera had a pretty good one up there
that he was a part of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, hopefully he's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are still waiting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're kind of just getting into this
conversation because we've still got Tony
[SPEAKER_08]: coming on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Alec from SC Labs and we've got
Chimera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those three guys are going to be a big
part of this sort of terpene conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite paper from what was actually a
poster, not a paper, was development of
[SPEAKER_00]: indication-specific cannabis chemo bars to
improve efficacy and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's by Ethan Russo and Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lewis used to be Ryan's boss.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan had a little bit of something to do
with some of the work on that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it on my phone right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Development of indication-specific
cannabis chemo bars to improve efficacy
[SPEAKER_08]: and safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about to improve all around
awesomeness?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see that on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: To improve all around awesomeness of the
plant on a paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be quite funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you could do that paper,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam probably has copyright on awesomeness
anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, trademark for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, enjoy it, Lynn Valley, D420K.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a house for Sunday, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony says he's getting out of the shower
here soon and we'll see him soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not sure what's going on with Mr. Chimera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we got to get Natasha back in too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent her the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Natasha, I've sent the link
every single weekend and I just send it to
[SPEAKER_08]: her.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know she's busy and she's doing a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, when she has the time,
we're always happy to have Natasha laying
[SPEAKER_08]: down knowledge in Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always easy when people show up
earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Poster, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone wants that poster.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will share that poster when we know
we're allowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really ours to share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure that they produced it for the
very reason of sharing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a book of abstracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can read the abstracts online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that information, if you reach out
to any author, most authors are kind and
[SPEAKER_01]: genuine enough to send you a PDF,
all you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually there's email information in
the abstract itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone really wants to get a copy
of the poster, it might take a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: email correspondences with the author,
but they'll eventually send you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's available publicly, then Ethan
Russo will send it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to go back, you guys,
to when we first talked about when people
[SPEAKER_06]: are growing, they always say they're the
best grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see that with a lot of people when I
used to work at some compassion and stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we get back into terpenes and
stuff like that, which you're mentioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody, when they came in with
their own weed that had just grown for the
[SPEAKER_06]: first time, like, smell this, it smells so
late, it's the best weed you've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: tried.
[SPEAKER_06]: And me and Paul Harmer used to laugh about
it because every grower used to always be
[SPEAKER_06]: the best grower because of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Used to?
[SPEAKER_06]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but, you know, not used to,
but, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a name of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the disease is it's small
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, big fish, small pond.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also comes down to that terpene
expression you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: That as they're growing it, they're
smelling that every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when it first comes to the harvest,
it's that, it's like, wow, because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: always, it's always, even in the spring,
we can barely smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, I mean, I really believe that
when you're talking about those terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that, I want to make
mention of that because I've seen that so
[SPEAKER_06]: much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even like myself, I grow the best
weed, of course, because it's mine and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm so used to that strain and that
smell and that accustomed to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find how that helps me with,
say, my pain control and my control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the person that's growing it,
it's helping them because of those
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, we're talking about the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how it helps me every day,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because I have a grower
that grows lavender.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lavender is a very fragrant type of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he grows it in France and he also
grows it in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as he does in those different
indigenous soils, he says the smells are
[SPEAKER_04]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where that plant naturally co-evolved
with, he said it's just a much more
[SPEAKER_04]: fragrant lavender, but it's the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he grows it in the United States,
it's not as potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as fragrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine France is well known for
growing the best lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a certain area, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Breast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget where they grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's hard to beat when you find
a particular combination of soil and soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and local eco environment that produces
the best of a particular plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means that we get to discover now
all over the planet the best places to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow cannabis and not necessarily the best
place to grow cannabis under prohibition,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's different when people say in
Jamaica, oh, the best herb grows in
[SPEAKER_08]: Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, does it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is that where the furthest place was
that you could get on the island from the
[SPEAKER_08]: police?
[SPEAKER_08]: That we're all in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my life I was told, the higher in the
mountain, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it was just, they were further
away from the authorities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that was literally connected
to that relationship almost every time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that we're in a position where
it's like, maybe we could grow anywhere we
[SPEAKER_08]: want and find these perfect terpene
expressions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the room, Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony V, in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check, check.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but he froze up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked for a second and then he froze
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, and now when we say depends on
strain, we can still be being correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just, we'll just, we'll tell people,
we're not talking about the strain of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no such thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about the bacterias,
the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, we don't have to run from the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, we can keep the right strains in
our closet now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Tony again.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lavender thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We extracted lavender for about 11 years
and they tested us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, they grew lavender in Kansas and
they grew lavender in South of France and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were comparing the two all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to a number of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Kansas never did grow his nice
lavender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we tried growing cannabis in the same
region of France that this lavender grows
[SPEAKER_08]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only variety that grows good there is
lavender cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some is lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the South of France.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, uh, dry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we're getting back, um, are just
really weird with, with the different,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, bacterias that we're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for instance, um, you know,
like a certain strain kosher Kush might be
[SPEAKER_04]: high in, in, you know, uh, one specific
terpene, but then when you use more or
[SPEAKER_04]: less of a certain bacteria, that,
that expression within the profile will
[SPEAKER_04]: completely change in the same stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, but what else is altering is,
is it a different photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a different light source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it different daily temperatures,
different humidities?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow the same clone under a dozen
different environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will get a dozen variations of that
basic profile.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what makes it such a difficult
game.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it's just not so easy for
people to just be like, I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all I have to do is use this product
called the turpinator.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, it's going to raise my,
it's like, well, there's variables for
[SPEAKER_08]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never used the turpinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's, is it gone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but I'm not bummed out with,
um, with soil balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did was we, um, and this is kind
of how the product was invented,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they, the gentlemen or the gentle,
the people that invented it would travel
[SPEAKER_04]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they would do is they'd go to like
deserts, um, different, uh, agro
[SPEAKER_04]: ecosystems and they would isolate strains
that grew on the roots of plants in all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy, you know how some guys
collect, um, uh, cars, some guys collect,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this, one of our microbiologists
would just collect different bacterias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioprospecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like, you know, stamp collectors
or coin collectors.
[SPEAKER_04]: He collected microbes and he, that's what
he would just do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go travel with his family and find
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did he collect any of these off the
roots of cannabis or all other plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis strains as well as like desert
strains and rainforest strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we found was the desert strains
actually work the fastest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, so think about the amount of rain
that comes into, um, a desert yearly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like four inches of rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when water comes into that environment,
the microorganisms that are dormant on the
[SPEAKER_04]: roots of those plants need to do the work,
uh, of a regular microorganism in a very
[SPEAKER_04]: short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of how it works in their little
world is as soon as the rain comes in,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, okay, it's time to grow
really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they proliferate at extremely fast
rates and then they have to signal the
[SPEAKER_04]: root.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's water here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to absorb the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to absorb the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they do is they create,
um, like signaling molecules or enzymes
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually, um, communicate with the
plant to grow larger and in this
[SPEAKER_04]: direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so the, the proliferation rate
through binary fission is exponentially
[SPEAKER_04]: higher than you would see in like a
rainforest strain that has a lot of time
[SPEAKER_04]: and water and moisture to do what it needs
to do to create that nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: availability.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so we isolated a lot of the desert
strains, but, but we also, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: combined them with strains from,
from like rainforests and cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and strawberries and, and trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we found was if you take the
strongest strains, the strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: innately understand that, um, their
survival is contingent on the long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: health and, and viability of their host
plant, then you're, you're, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: isolating the giver, the giving strains,
the strains that, um, understand that they
[SPEAKER_04]: won't survive if they just simply take
from the plant, like a pathogen does,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like rhizoctonia, fusarium,
verticillium, um, pythium, those,
[SPEAKER_04]: those strains are born to just take from
the plant for their own short-term
[SPEAKER_04]: survival.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the strains that we've isolated are
the ones that, um, really work together
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and give of themselves to improve
that environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very beautiful, elegant thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and we've done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we've done is we've,
we've increased amounts of these bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: that you wouldn't normally find in,
in like a regular soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think about what we're doing
with the cannabis plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're putting it into a soil that it might
not naturally have ever evolved naturally,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, um, and so because we're doing
that, we need to reproduce, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the biology in there that it would
kind of feel that it had in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so when we increase that biology,
the terpene expressions are just
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, we, we've seen,
um, nine or 10 different types of
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes, all at balanced levels,
which from what we're told from a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratories, uh, you know, and this will
be great to talk to Essie about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That most of the cannabis cup winners,
uh, have one or two or three or four
[SPEAKER_04]: different types of terpenes, all at very
high levels and then micro doses of the
[SPEAKER_04]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas our terpene profiles are
consistently coming in with nine or 10
[SPEAKER_04]: different types of terpenes, all at
balance levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's again, because of that,
uh, increase of the naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria that that plant co-evolved with
in nature is what we're trying to mimic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty massive move a little bit
more than what might be seen with a small
[SPEAKER_08]: variable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've definitely, you know, Tony might be
able to talk a little bit better about it
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause he's had quite a few terpene
profiles done with SC labs and I know
[SPEAKER_08]: little things have moved, but having a
massive move, like what you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: saying, like eight or nine terpene levels
that are, that are high rather than a
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant with many, many smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something I haven't personally seen
in a test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: No laboratory that we talked to has ever
seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, this is a scientific anomaly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen, have you seen anything like
that, Mark Sheldone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen, you mean in terms of a
profile where it's pretty flat and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: really no single dominant and there's like
about four or five or maybe as many,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you say is eight or nine,
but not small amounts, still larger
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what are, what's the overall level
of terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you looking at basically a lower
level of all of them or you're bringing up
[SPEAKER_01]: everything to just an entire level?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not exactly telling me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sorry to not scientifically
equate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so on a percentage basis, what you
find, what we normally find on a micro
[SPEAKER_04]: dose is under 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like for instance, let's see,
a lot of, of, of strains will have a
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenoline at like maybe like,
like 0.02 or 0.04, 0.05.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 0.1 would be, you know, a pretty high
level of, of a terpene in any profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about... In common,
all levels of terpenes are just saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you said that you, you're seeing this
across the board, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so actually that level would be
lower for say like something like
[SPEAKER_01]: terapoline, depending on the strain and
depending on, are you looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking at native flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a, a hole punch analysis
in a grow or is this cured material or is
[SPEAKER_01]: this what, what are you measuring terpenes
on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a flour sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a dried and cured flower sample
with, with, without leaves or... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was a dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so, so one of the analysis that
we did, it was a, it was a, it was dried
[SPEAKER_04]: and cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was four months old.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sent it in and it came in at 1.55%
total terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were... That sounds,
that sounds pretty average.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the average on the low side depends,
you know, I'm like, you know, there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much variability in test results because
what's dry to one person may not be dry to
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water has a great deal to do with the
overall mass fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just measuring percent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what that's done with this
internal standard works normalized to,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's what the internal standard is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We added this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're basically normalizing all the
concentrations of terpenes based on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know how much we added to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, is, is your biology,
or is this technique resulting in an
[SPEAKER_01]: overall increase of beans beyond the
baseline of what is typical, typically
[SPEAKER_01]: observed, or is it within that,
within what's known?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The average that we found after testing
164 different flower samples with the same
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory in this is with about 30
different growers, just their flower
[SPEAKER_04]: samples was 0.2 to 0.4%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that we were at 1.5 on this is
significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the laboratory that we need
to... Or maybe because it was so the
[SPEAKER_00]: material was so dry, maybe people... When
you look at the samples that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: done by SC Labs and other people at the
Emerald Cup, they have varieties which are
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching 5%.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 is nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't even run it if it's one.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know, I chimed in on the
subject matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could tell you that it's interesting
because let's talk about a variety called
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Lime Reserve from Aficionado.
[SPEAKER_10]: THC is like 7%.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, under 10%.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the terpene profile can be 5 to 7.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our world record.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've seen like 25 mils a pound in
terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus!
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's significantly different than
anything else I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the farmers that are growing that,
I asked them what they're doing because
[SPEAKER_10]: there was several varieties that they were
cultivating and all of them were 2 to 3.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said to study... He studied... He
had studied... He does like a no-till,
[SPEAKER_10]: like, I don't know, live soil,
but he had added... I forget what he was
[SPEAKER_10]: doing with different kinds of minerals
that he put into the soil, but he studied
[SPEAKER_10]: cucumbers and he studied the effects of
terpenes, increasing terpene and...
[SPEAKER_10]: Terpene and flavonoids and fruits and
different vegetables and cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cucumbers was something he was studying
and he was... This farmer was able to...
[SPEAKER_10]: To what I could see from the average
people out there that were growing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, when you start seeing 2,
3, 4, 5% coming from a group of their
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers, they're doing something
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: When you lower that THC... It's funny for
all these years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we've got to get the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like you can distill that shit
super easy from like any schwag oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you grow the hydrocarbons?
[SPEAKER_08]: The terpenes that are... You just can't
get them any other way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like fuck the THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would say on most all of those,
they weren't above 20%.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could see like it was interesting
because if you think about according to
[SPEAKER_10]: what we've talked about on this panel,
and I know I argue against some of it
[SPEAKER_10]: sometimes, but I feel that there's,
you know, the heads and the resin itself
[SPEAKER_10]: isn't the only thing as the carrier for
these types of terpenes and or
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there's something...
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're looking at it like as a grape
or, you know, you're looking at it in a
[SPEAKER_10]: macro level and you see those big heads
and you see the different varieties,
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be strange to have the THC lower
and the terpenes higher if we're talking
[SPEAKER_10]: about just resin heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we're talking about terpenes,
overall terpenes on a plant material,
[SPEAKER_10]: it makes a little bit more sense because
you would think the bigger the head,
[SPEAKER_10]: the more the THC you would have,
but not in the case that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's what it's producing though,
because keep in mind that THC is produced
[SPEAKER_08]: from the building blocks of hydrocarbons
and phenols.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the place where we went from,
just on this particular grower and his
[SPEAKER_04]: style and his approach, so he was growing
open-loop, no CO2 and with an old strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: Kosher Kush that, you know, he had never
modified or done anything with and he had
[SPEAKER_04]: tested his product before and he was at
0.19.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after with the addition of the
bacteria, it took him to 1.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what I've seen with a lot of the good
strains that if you go online and you look
[SPEAKER_04]: at the high times best tasting buds in the
world, the average is around two to three
[SPEAKER_04]: percent, but the profiles are so
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The profiles you see one or two or three
or four different types of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but to get the plant the correct biology
to produce a much more comprehensive
[SPEAKER_04]: combination of the terpenes, I really
believe with all my heart that if you can
[SPEAKER_04]: have nine or ten different types of
terpenes all at high levels, you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a much more comprehensive efficacy
to that oil than isolating strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: are maybe just from... Just because
they're only showing the dozen terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean that's all the plant has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for example, I've always seen more
than 50 terpenes every variety I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say, maybe I missed something and
I probably missed it on the last hash
[SPEAKER_10]: search or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say the word bacteria?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you introducing bacteria to the plant
to increase terpene level?
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe that's pulling out some kind of
defense mechanism in the immune system or
[SPEAKER_10]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was like Sam was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like not a great stretch to know that
if you grow your tomatoes with shitty
[SPEAKER_08]: store bought food in a soilless mixture,
they're not going to taste as good as the
[SPEAKER_08]: heirloom tomatoes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Proper genetics grown in the proper
environment with living soils and like
[SPEAKER_08]: bacterias.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some farmers in California that
they take their tomatoes down to the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers market and they actually,
I mean, I know I don't want to like boast
[SPEAKER_04]: like our stuff is the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: These growers are great organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take their product down to the
farmers market and they literally have a
[SPEAKER_04]: line of people waiting to get these
tomatoes and they sell out within hours
[SPEAKER_04]: because the flavor is so sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Peter, how can I get these tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll head down and check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to have, I used to have a raw food
cafe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know exactly what you're talking
about because when I had my raw food cafe,
[SPEAKER_08]: I was forced to get to know farmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no distribution companies that
just, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was independent relationships with
farmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I got to know a couple of really
amazing heirloom tomato growers and you
[SPEAKER_08]: know that I've never experienced the pride
of tomatoes, like almost on a level of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis pride.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they were so proud of this work that
they had done.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had put love into these tomatoes and
you could taste it with each and every
[SPEAKER_08]: bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also hard to find heirloom tomato
shippers because heirloom tomatoes split
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what you got to do is either
make a tomato sauce out of it or eat it
[SPEAKER_00]: within a few days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd bring it in a big basket and they'd
all be kind of like have their own little
[SPEAKER_08]: things around them and the colors were
just, it was like, I've never seen that
[SPEAKER_08]: many earth tone colors in a single box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So bugs are our friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll tell you, how much that
statement is true, John, a old Rastafarian
[SPEAKER_08]: friend of mine named the doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the guy with the seven foot long
dreads.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I took Remo up to his place and I took
Pete Brady, photographer from cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: culture up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've done stories on this guy in the
past.
[SPEAKER_08]: He would tell, we'd be out in the bush and
he'd be like, Oh, do you want some sugar
[SPEAKER_08]: cane?
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd pull off a cane and he'd hand crack
and juice this cane in the bush.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hand juice, sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you understand how fucking hard that
is?
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd smash the middle with another piece
of cane and then he'd turn it into a gourd
[SPEAKER_08]: and go get a little lime and a little
passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he would always choose the fruit that
the bugs were on because he said the bugs
[SPEAKER_08]: don't like poison so they don't go on the
poisoned plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought that is so fucking genius
where I come from.
[SPEAKER_08]: People only eat the poison plants because
they don't want bugs on their food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to this concept with regard,
you guys have aphids, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So an aphid sees in kind of like a
predator style, like heat spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's their field of vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a sustainable agriculture
methodology to get rid of aphids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So an aphid, when it's flying around,
if the macro micronutrient levels within
[SPEAKER_04]: the leaf tissue are not in balance and
harmony, the aphid will see like a heat
[SPEAKER_04]: signature on the plant leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like the predator in that movie
sees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll actually zone in and they'll
concentrate and lay their eggs and begin
[SPEAKER_04]: to colonize in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're able to properly balance
the micro macros of that plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: what will happen is the plant will create
a natural ultraviolet frequency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll almost be like a blinding light
to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the aphid's flying over,
not only will they not go to the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it'll be so bright that they'll go
away, leave that plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's savage.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the aphid is like a lion just
looking for the weakness.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the weakness.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know it because people with the
weakest grow rooms, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A special aphid that ignores the
ultraviolet and goes right for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that would make sense with terpenes
as a defense mechanism too, while you're
[SPEAKER_10]: getting certain rises in certain ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because as you said, as you introduced
different proper techniques like that,
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant and this particular plant loves
to respond to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been on the planet a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that you can manipulate the
outcomes without any kind of genetic
[SPEAKER_10]: manipulation by what you're talking about,
whether you're using spores.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's people that use different types of
spores in the soil and nevatodes and
[SPEAKER_10]: different kinds of like- Beneficials.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beneficials and predators that will
actually attack the things that are
[SPEAKER_10]: attacking the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it makes sense for what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with Todd in the sense that fuck these
other bugs being put on my plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you're a macro photographer and
you see the bug shit, I don't care if the
[SPEAKER_08]: bug shit comes from beneficial bugs or
fucking bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bug shit and I don't want it on my
resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love the idea of creating this more
sort of living symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you were in the room,
Tony, but one of the things that Peter
[SPEAKER_08]: said that was really interesting was his
friend was going around collecting
[SPEAKER_08]: bacterias from all these different plants
and all these different types of
[SPEAKER_08]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the bacterias they found was
from the desert.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these desert bacterias,
when the rain comes, the three to four
[SPEAKER_08]: inches that they get every year,
it sort of pumps the roots into overdrive
[SPEAKER_08]: saying, hey, hey, hey, the water's here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to- And it's like this unique sort
of aspect of taking that bacteria and
[SPEAKER_08]: putting it on a plant, a little helper.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very unique and interesting-
Yeah, that's how we get our roots to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: so fast is we've put some of these desert
strains that are signaling the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying, hey, there's an enzymatic
communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the microbial product industry has kind
of been in a holding pattern for several
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we use bacillus subtilis,
we use trichoderma, we use mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those were discovered in the
1800s, and they're great strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been focused exclusively on what
a microbe can do on its own versus what
[SPEAKER_04]: they can generate together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be looking at nitrogen fixation
or phosphorus solubilization or certain
[SPEAKER_04]: things that these organisms can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've done is we've looked at what
microbes can produce together that give
[SPEAKER_04]: them their efficacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The synergy of what's creating in this
group is a much higher level and a much
[SPEAKER_04]: higher resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on your website that you have,
I think, 52 different microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that include trichoderma?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're great strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we're looking at what one can
do versus what they can produce together.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm asking about if one of the 52 you
used was trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad to hear you do use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've done is really focused the
majority of our company to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what these guys produce in
combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what those are called is they're called
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically microbe shit,
microbe pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So each organism will create like a
certain enzyme or a chemical or an acid or
[SPEAKER_04]: a hormone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you have all these different
strains and they're all creating what are
[SPEAKER_04]: called these secondary metabolites,
what happens if they're able to colonize
[SPEAKER_04]: the rhizosphere, the root, if they're
rhizobacteria, they'll create like a
[SPEAKER_04]: sludge together, like a film, like a
biofilm that's just caking every,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like encumbering every centimeter
of root, the fine root hairs as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: they protect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it can work as like a natural chelating
agent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the things that they do,
like for instance, the acids that they
[SPEAKER_04]: create.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about when you guys put your
fertilizer in and you've got a,
[SPEAKER_04]: think about on a microscopic level and
you've got a piece of calcium,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a piece of calcium could be like the
size of the Empire State building and our
[SPEAKER_04]: microbes are the size of an ant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that calcium can't go into the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the microorganisms are creating an
acid, it works like a natural chelating
[SPEAKER_04]: agent to juice that calcium and allow it
to be what's called bioavailable or plant
[SPEAKER_04]: absorbable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we increase the efficacy of
conventional and organic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_04]: exponentially, but that's just one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about this concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the root is communicating enzymatically
with certain strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what our guys will do, even in a
hydropower, hydroponic system is they'll
[SPEAKER_04]: find where the concentrations are of
nutrients and they'll talk to the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and they'll say, hey man, grow your root
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the good stuff is for you to,
that's where some water is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where some food is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's what they do naturally in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, hey man, the water's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All life has to have water and carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what they'll do is they'll be like,
okay, it's time to grow this way root,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it's time to grow bigger, or it's time
to relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, these guys innately want
the best for the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're givers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all about improving the
environment, making sure that the
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainability of their species and their
children and future generations has a
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy environment versus the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pathogens only take for their short
term survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of drought tolerance should be
put into food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The types of corn that can grow in
sub-Saharan Africa that don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture that we have over here in North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plant life is absolutely connected to
microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're living in a microbial world,
like it or not, no matter how much hand
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner you think you could use,
and no matter how much floor cleaner you
[SPEAKER_01]: use, there's still a microbial mess in
this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere you look at all forms of
soluble carbon will be viewed as food for
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of microbe and Darwinian
evolution of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's more microbial mass
on this earth right now by a factor of 10
[SPEAKER_01]: than there are all other kinds of biology
combined.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more in your beard than there is
humans on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant that actually is not roots in
the ground, the plant evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to in a hydroponic system or in
some flower pot somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always thought that the actual synergy
that the plant has in enjoyed for a
[SPEAKER_01]: millennia in the microbial world where the
roots are, which is down in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a recreation of the earth,
but the actual earth itself puts a
[SPEAKER_01]: different type of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the kind of thing that you're
seeing, not only with secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites, but now using genomics,
and this would be great to get Kevin in on
[SPEAKER_01]: this discussion, you could actually create
an induced panel and look at all the known
[SPEAKER_01]: genes in a variety of different pathways
and look to see whether or not these types
[SPEAKER_01]: of assaults or environmental assaults lead
into the up expression of certain genes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are hallmarks for turning on certain
pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: In drought tolerance, I know that that's
very well studied in both soybean and
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, what happens and what makes a good
drought tolerant plant and I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just straightforward plant breeding,
but ultimately they're able to engineer
[SPEAKER_01]: those pathways into the organism itself to
make them drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think the interesting thing you're
doing, if I could just all finish it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that recently there was a company
looking for registration with the EPA and
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Pruitt just issued this two page
response saying that, cannabis is illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: and the EPA is not going to regulate on
products that can be used in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and so therefore I don't even
know why we're being asked this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course the answer is no, fuck you,
and basically turned around the document.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, thank you to everyone who
voted for Donald Trump for putting this
[SPEAKER_01]: idiot in charge of EPA who basically could
be making strides to help the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry by being able to take the initial
steps to understand that biological
[SPEAKER_01]: warfare and biological control level that
you're talking about is the safest way to
[SPEAKER_01]: control diseases that could affect
cannabis because no company right now has
[SPEAKER_01]: a data set to show that chemically or
applied chemical pesticides or fungicides
[SPEAKER_01]: or herbicides or whatever are going to
have any type of bad effect on humans
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's never been studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not likely going to be any
company that's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these companies that are trying to do
this with biological control have the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact, you know, this is the lever to turn
here and it's the way that you can control
[SPEAKER_01]: as you see how these things affect what
goes on in the plant not just because
[SPEAKER_01]: humans like them, terpenes are there for a
plant response to a defense and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental insult, whether it's insects
or whether it's fungi or bugs or most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely microbes, microbes are involved at
every level and everything that goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects rely on microbes because the
microbes start doing the chewing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: initial thing and then that rings the
dinner bell for a whole zoo of fungi that
[SPEAKER_01]: just follows after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very intimately involved in any type of
fungal attack, microbes are there and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria are there from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just recognize that yeah, the plants
need bacteria to live and I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: approach that you and this other company
are taking to use a microbiological way of
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing the soil's own biome better
control plant disease is exactly what you
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fuck this EPA administrator because
this guy and the administration needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently have read some research where a
biofilm was the subject of it that
[SPEAKER_02]: companies were looking to coat fruits and
vegetables with a biofilm to increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: longevity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while they accomplished that,
the other thing they noticed was if this
[SPEAKER_02]: biofilm was applied to the base and the
bottom part of the plants that insects
[SPEAKER_02]: that crawl up on these plants didn't
recognize it as food any longer and so
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore did not attack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a URL with Mark for you to go
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw the URL up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you want to finish what you were
saying there before Mark?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd love to tell you guys a little
bit about water because I think it's such
[SPEAKER_04]: an important issue for our species and our
planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that our microbes are
is they're saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is a saprophite is a
type of organism that will actually live
[SPEAKER_04]: on and decompose carbon or organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's interesting is and this is kind
of a unique content for me to disclose
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all understand that carbon
sequestration is done through plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: As they do so, they create different
sugars and carbohydrates out of their
[SPEAKER_04]: roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they turn the carbon into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as the root does this, our
microorganisms and most soil
[SPEAKER_04]: microorganisms do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just introducing them in larger
numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these soil organisms, our soil
organisms specifically, are all
[SPEAKER_04]: saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of our strains are saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is they will create a
layer of insoluble hydrophilic humus
[SPEAKER_04]: around the root, within the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means in lay terms is that
the organisms will actually use the
[SPEAKER_04]: different secondary metabolites that I was
disclosing to you and decompose almost
[SPEAKER_04]: like a composting effect all around the
root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way it can create a substance
called humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, humus can hold 80% of its own weight
in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're finding right now with a lot
of our growers is that they're able to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow corn, they're able to grow onions,
and beets, and carrots in Arizona out of
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what's happening is there's a
layer, a hydrophilic layer of water that's
[SPEAKER_04]: being held within those bioavailable
nutrients that's also part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: mineralization process.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a mineralization process that
happens when you decompose carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the macromicros available to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was talking about the New York big
building thing and how it's turned into a
[SPEAKER_04]: bioavailable form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, both of those processes are able to
create a sustainability factor in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have water when the
plant needs it in those fine root hairs
[SPEAKER_04]: that you were talking about, Sam,
which are protected by our product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're also that biofilm that these
microorganisms are creating is the
[SPEAKER_04]: protective layer that disallow certain
health issues to encumber the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why one of the things that we
disclose is we are able to keep the roots
[SPEAKER_04]: white and healthy for the duration of the
crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing is that these plants
will have water whenever they need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use a lot less water to
cultivate your crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like back to what Mark was saying,
like if you go to a Home Depot or a
[SPEAKER_10]: Walmart or Target Garden Center,
look at like what the masses have access
[SPEAKER_10]: to, not so much in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could walk into an urban garden place
and get any mix that you want,
[SPEAKER_10]: live soils, compost things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's say the average American who has
access to plants and soils, they get
[SPEAKER_10]: Scotts soil, they get micro, they get,
what's the two most popular things we see
[SPEAKER_10]: is Scotts soil and what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_10]: Miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Miracle grow, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, it's a turn off,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't know you had a product,
but like late to the show here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But why wouldn't you want to try to get
what you're talking about, not just in the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis industry, but maybe you are,
maybe you've come from a different
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, but why wouldn't you get it out
to the masses so that we could correct our
[SPEAKER_10]: farming across America?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reminded by a marketing guy that
miracle grow is not a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle grow is a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of schooled me on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, it started as a chemical as a,
like this, just spray miracle grow on your
[SPEAKER_10]: plants and you don't have to ever feed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it started as like a, didn't it start
as a nutrient and now it's just a brand
[SPEAKER_10]: that has lots of shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: But Scotts, Scotts soil and miracle grow
are both, I think, owned by the same
[SPEAKER_10]: company, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gavita, they want to control interesting
Gavita lights too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those people are definitely making a
play into the cannabis space.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not sustainable because as we
know, this plant's very interesting in the
[SPEAKER_10]: fact that it will mutate around and like,
it allows things to, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: everyone thinks growing cannabis without
pesticides in a 20% THC or CBD with two to
[SPEAKER_10]: 3% terpenes is easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's extremely hard and 90% of everyone
fails.
[SPEAKER_10]: So cannabis is the very tricky one because
it's multi-complex, multi-dimensional,
[SPEAKER_10]: hundreds of cannabinoids, hundreds of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we talk about a tomato or a
cucumber or lavender, or I've got
[SPEAKER_10]: spearmint plants and lemon plants and
different herbs in time, wouldn't we get
[SPEAKER_10]: start there at the foundation of our herbs
and our foods that are being, our herbs
[SPEAKER_10]: that are being grown by everyone that's at
home.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not talking about the food you access.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's start at the home grower because I'm
growing 10 herbs right here on my balcony,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's people that grow all of their
little like basil and sweet mints and
[SPEAKER_10]: things like that, but they're using Scotts
and miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be for me more of a start
than cannabis, even though I appreciate
[SPEAKER_10]: everything you're saying and doing for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're talking about species as humans
and we're talking about survival,
[SPEAKER_10]: then it would be implemented into the
mainstream first, no?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we've been working for the
last 20 years and it's my life's work to
[SPEAKER_04]: go back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything that I've done has been to
work with organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have hundreds of thousands of acres
that we're being applied to with different
[SPEAKER_04]: forms of this biology with organic
cultivators and sustainable cultivators
[SPEAKER_04]: and conventional cultivators.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the product is getting out there,
but this industry right now is producing
[SPEAKER_04]: something so sacred for children with
seizures, for mothers with tumors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to help.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to give to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are the saviors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are the stewards of our lands and
our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here to support you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've come to the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony brings up a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, Tony, it's going to be made.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be put out at a price point
where you guys can use this in abundance
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can really see the efficacy of all
the things that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sustainability, the environmental and
the health of the plant increase
[SPEAKER_04]: exponentially with the correct application
of life to the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here for a limited time to work with
these cannabis cultivators because I
[SPEAKER_04]: believe that you guys right now are our
key to showing the world that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: produce a commodity in a safe,
environmentally friendly and conscious way
[SPEAKER_04]: and nurturing way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are more tuned into your plants
than any other grower that I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, there's cultivators out there
that still believe that their granddaddy
[SPEAKER_04]: and the way that it was always done is the
right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been a big battle for us to be
able to transition a lot of these guys to
[SPEAKER_04]: more sustainable, conscious ways of
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a life's work for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I will never stop doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What agricultural crime is to bring and to
actually help us get this message out and
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to, I just have to put the
product out and you guys will be the ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: the light beings that will take this
product out to the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that with all my heart and
that's why we're in the cannabis space is
[SPEAKER_04]: because we need to have this in our food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have the correct light.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, what I would like to add is
that I have kind of a way when I meet
[SPEAKER_08]: people and when I have a conversation with
people and it's sort of, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_08]: just, I'll read people and when I met
Tony, I knew him for about five minutes
[SPEAKER_08]: before I was like, holy shit, I'm gonna
end up spending a lot of time with this
[SPEAKER_08]: dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a feeling it's like, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Peter really resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only the fact that he's highly
intelligent and articulate in his ability
[SPEAKER_08]: to share this information, but that he's
so conscious.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's so like, I believe him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe when he talks and he sounds like
he could almost break into tears because
[SPEAKER_08]: you really believe the guy loves this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is his life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so why we didn't want to go about him
saying, oh, hey, bubble man, I'll send you
[SPEAKER_08]: this product.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can try it on your crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it works, you can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I resonated with it in a way that I
said, well, why don't we just bring it to
[SPEAKER_08]: church?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You've noticed we haven't been dropping
the name of the company a ton.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just sharing the information,
but you know, I want my, my listeners,
[SPEAKER_08]: our audience, our audience to be able to
be in a situation where if this is
[SPEAKER_08]: something they want to try, they can try
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can do it sort of along with some of
us that will end up trying it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be transparent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be some, oh,
let's do this all behind closed doors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we see, no, let's just make it
transparent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to see something.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to see something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just, let's just try it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the idea of going down this rabbit
hole of knowledge because the information
[SPEAKER_08]: that you're sharing, Peter, I can tell
you, I know very little about,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I want to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, what crop is this product mostly
on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I started to interrupt Sam, but I really
appreciate you having, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: us here for, for, for what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not anything special.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not like, you know, we, we,
we've just been fortunate and lucky to
[SPEAKER_04]: find the right biology that is really
conducive to help increase the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_04]: this plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I can't tell you how grateful I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the space that you've given me to come
in and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What agricultural crop is, is your product
mostly used on besides cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a single crop that you find uses
it better than any other crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different formulations of the
microbes for different plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll tell you what, it's, it's
actually unbelievable how well our product
[SPEAKER_04]: works on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's almost mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: 52 microorganisms for different crops,
for different species.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we buy some?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can we buy some for our cannabis
crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a website set up called
soilbalancepro.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's soilbalancepro.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you'll get a feel for what we
believe a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology, the science.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to, you know, be a sales
person and, you know, but, but we're,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've made it affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So $14 and 50 cents, or I think it's 1495,
we'll give you five grams and that creates
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 gallons of liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each gallon will have 6.1 trillion
microbes per gallon and 62 different
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties, all of beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you inoculate your soil,
like you, or, or even in hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_04]: because these guys all live on the root,
so they're risal competent, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: bacterias, they, they will just regenerate
and live on the roots for the duration of
[SPEAKER_04]: the crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more you put them on the higher
titters, you'll get the higher microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: titters and, and, and then the terpene,
even in a, even in a, a strain that's
[SPEAKER_04]: producing 5%, uh, uh, terpene levels could
go higher and more diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I smoked some of this stuff and I'd
love to tell you guys one of these days
[SPEAKER_04]: about the experience that I had smoking
this with nine different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do understand that terpenes are
expressed by the ability of the plant to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, produce them, which is controlled
by the terpene synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant doesn't have a particular
terpene synthase, it can't produce that
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, if the plant doesn't have the
CBD synthase, it cannot produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam, we should have a whole show on,
on the synthase.
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear we should make a special panel for
just that conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that is, that's a serious fucking
deep rabbit hole you're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that is like not an offshoot of this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just about T, uh,
the cannabinoids, it's the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's the synthase.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I, it's another thing I don't
understand completely, but that I would
[SPEAKER_08]: love to hear us talk about more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure the audience would as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, go ahead, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so this, this grower, uh, brought me
some, some stuff and, um, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, it was, um, I've been, I've been
smoking grass since.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is nine star flour, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just joking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for those that know what that
mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: You call flour a one star because it
doesn't melt, but this is a nine star
[SPEAKER_10]: flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was just a flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually melted into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not, I'm, I'm stopping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It like poured out of the grinder.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: After I, it literally poured out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't even tip it over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put it to my nose and it was like,
like so pungent that it was like a wasabi
[SPEAKER_04]: or like a, like a horseradish,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If I put it really close, I was like,
oh, it's, it's so, I could hold it about
[SPEAKER_04]: right here, but if I put it here,
it was too smelly to even put that close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so I grinded it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I, I, it poured out like it
wouldn't come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it leaked out into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I smoked it, it was kind of
like a, like my kids watch Willy Wonka and
[SPEAKER_04]: the Chocolate Factory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like violet bullriga on there,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Willy Wonka's gum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, Hey dad, here comes the,
the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the turkey dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's totally how it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, like I tasted chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted blueberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted like so many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your taste buds were going bananas as it
went in and as you exhaled, just going
[SPEAKER_10]: bananas in every which way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was crazy about it was it was
kind of like smoking a hookah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like instead of, you know how,
when you smoke a hookah, it's like really
[SPEAKER_04]: light, like air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it just, you could like take a huge
rip and it's just like fills like air when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're smoking a hookah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's how this stuff was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had, I didn't even have the slightest
notion to cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I had no like or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like super light air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and it was kind of like hash,
like a, like kind of like an edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it was very conscious,
very clean, you know, not, not super,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, where I was really stoned out,
but, but it, but it worked like an edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause after like 10 minutes, I really
peaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't peak out around the beginning,
but after about 10, 15 minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like really, really feeling good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it lasted forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lasted like four hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a pretty good question from someone
in the chat room for you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, is there products to avoid using when
using, um, your products that could
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially wipe out these beneficials?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've made this product really durable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the soil balance will, I mean,
it will really stand up to pesticides and
[SPEAKER_04]: most fungicides, any type of a fertilizer,
but, um, systemic fungicides kick our ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you use a systemic,
it's going to go into the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to go through the vascular
system of the plant and end in the root
[SPEAKER_04]: zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our guys live on the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything else you can use, we're
friendly to any, you know, we know a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of you guys are protecting your crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got money coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use your pesticides with this
product if you have to, to protect your
[SPEAKER_04]: investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's using the fungicide systemic
fungicide on cannabis to be hung up and
[SPEAKER_00]: dried.
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.
[SPEAKER_08]: For real.
[SPEAKER_08]: That scares me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and in, you know, in California,
a lot of people use sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ones that really,
that really knock us down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but what you'll find with using this,
the soil balance is you're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehensive health.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we hope you find with using
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of like our bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a really good community and
you've got a really high level of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of, uh, of the biology in your own body,
it's not going to be conducive to a bad pH
[SPEAKER_04]: or, or bad, you know, um, um, is it
susceptible to copper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will copper take it out?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, none of the organic, you can use
any, any organic, um, uh, pesticide or
[SPEAKER_04]: fungicide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our, our, our, our colony is faster than
any pesticide can kill it, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a first in the industry as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's most of these products,
you know, have strains that when you put
[SPEAKER_04]: them into the acidity of the soil
environment, a lot of them will die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for instance, compost tea,
microbe strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to think about compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love compost tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big advocate of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the humics in it, the fulvics,
all the, the macro microbes are beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: in that the enzymes, but think about the
strains that are coming in from a compost
[SPEAKER_04]: tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got, uh, maybe strains that,
that live on the plant tissue,
[SPEAKER_04]: the biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got strains that are coming from
animal intestines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so when you introduce those to the
root, um, a lot of them will do a good
[SPEAKER_04]: job, but some of them may die,
you know, after a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing is introducing
regenerative soil microorganisms that
[SPEAKER_04]: exclusively live on the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we have all 52 of these been
tested with cannabis together or in some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of scientific study.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we, we, we worked so hard to get it
to a point where we could make it
[SPEAKER_04]: available for hydroponic and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's been the, the scientific
feat, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been the big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we create a product that will work
without soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we've, we've all 62 of these are
saprophytic, which means they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: live on the root because the root produces
sugars and carbohydrates that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that will sustain them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so the, the fact that there's water
there as well as that, uh, carbon on the
[SPEAKER_04]: root, we just grow like crazy all over
the, uh, all over the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I was really asking was if
the 52 different microorganisms were
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed at different ratios,
might it be better for different varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I guess that's what I was really
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've, we've, we've found that
certain strains will be conducive for
[SPEAKER_04]: certain, um, plants, but they kind of BCA
family, um, which includes hops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we actually have refined these strains
to work with that plant family.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't matter the strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and maybe that's limited thinking
on my part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe eventually we can do some,
some deeper analytics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are things that are laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we, you know, get more sales and we
build, we're still kind of a boutique
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer, you know, we're,
we're coming out, um, trying to grow with,
[SPEAKER_04]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, you know, we want to be a part of
this, this industry and be a part of you
[SPEAKER_04]: and the growers and support you guys and
be your servants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, those types of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we, we would like to eventually
have a laboratory where we can evolve to
[SPEAKER_04]: study that, you know, maybe really refine
and tune in for each strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how amazing would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of law cannabis are either
varieties or cultivars, bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so he's selling a strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I said, that's why I said
only $2 a gram or $3 a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're buying tiny amounts of a strain
salesman, I'm, I'm a micro, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a cultivator and, uh, I try,
I try and, um, whenever we sell these
[SPEAKER_04]: things, I always try and tune into to
giving like a good gratitude and offering
[SPEAKER_04]: with these guys, because that's kind of
what we're doing to our plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and, and working with this
technology has really tuned me into how
[SPEAKER_04]: important that unseen world of light of
life is, you know, to be able to give life
[SPEAKER_04]: to the roots of plants is, is an amazing
thing that I'm really grateful for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try and just continually offer,
you know, abundance and, and, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: and gratitude for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys taken, um, macroscopic
photographs of your root systems?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that you mentioned that
somebody was like, Hey, you got to start
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, uh, microscopic photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we see it under the story,
but we don't trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just get bubble man to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it sounds like he really wants to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, Tony, I'm up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to introduce them to you or
Todd.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's Peter at?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's Peter at?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're down in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't you Peter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'm in Arizona, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So closer still.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, people from Canada think
everything's close.
[SPEAKER_10]: Arizona and California is kind of far
away, but closer than Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's way closer to me than you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: That, um, I've got a buddy in the,
uh, industry, um, uh, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: that you've seen me support before with
vital and, and, uh, they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: different, uh, work in California with a
lot of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, what you're talking about with
fit really, really, really well with the
[SPEAKER_10]: biodynamic, sustainable farming and
practices that, uh, that are going on in
[SPEAKER_10]: California, um, because they are doing
greenhouses and controlled greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, you have to, you know,
you're dealing with, you're not growing
[SPEAKER_10]: indoor, so you're dealing with everything
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so everything can be a predator,
um, not just, not just bugs, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_10]: conditions, whether, you know,
the, uh, dynamic range between the daytime
[SPEAKER_10]: temperature and the nighttime temperature,
the way the plant transpires, um,
[SPEAKER_10]: all kinds of, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like you've, you've made
almost a, like, uh, uh, if I could kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: summarize what, what I'm saying,
what I'm hearing, it sounds like you've
[SPEAKER_10]: made a, um, a water soluble, uh,
probiotic for the root system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like when we go and get a kombucha,
you've made a, uh, a way to, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: like create a water soluble colony that's,
that's in the trillions, um, that that's
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of like a probiotic for humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's dialed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yeah, that's exactly what we've
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that Tony had pointed out
before, which is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of the growing public needs
to know about this because of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when they're going to buy gross
supplies and maybe if they live up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods in Humboldt, they only come down to
the civilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once they're going to go to a big box
retailer, they're going to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: Walmart, they're going to a Lowe's,
they're going to go to a Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are they going to find there?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to find miracle grow and
Scots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that other crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to get the word out on
these kinds of things because until the
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA regulates registrations for those
things, they're never going to find their
[SPEAKER_01]: way into those retail channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott's miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They own the retail channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if it's sold in a Home Depot
today, and if it's a plant insect control
[SPEAKER_01]: product, chances are, it comes from a
handful of companies that pay for that
[SPEAKER_01]: channel access to that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people who live up in the woods,
who need to commute once a week down to go
[SPEAKER_01]: get their supplies, they're trapped
because what store is available?
[SPEAKER_01]: The store that's available is the Walmart
or the whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to go there and they're
going to buy and stock up on all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: crap, do their homework in advance,
reach out to you on the web or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever your channel, you're able to get
your product out there to let people know
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's an alternative other than
those supplies that are sold.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure it's easier said than.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're saying right now, this is just
lighting up and I kind of want to tune
[SPEAKER_04]: into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're saying right now, that's why
we're in, and it answers your question
[SPEAKER_04]: too, Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really why we're in this cannabis
space because there's no other plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you can see the efficacy as
prevalent than this cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like a magical plant for what
we're trying to do with our mission
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the quality enhancement,
the terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is actually magical by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the differences of the panel,
like such different personalities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to cut you off, Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to go in three seconds,
but I just had to say right on for all of
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys, thanks for spending your time
here every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say that when we think of
the plant and its evolution, you have to
[SPEAKER_10]: also think of the actual endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it did actually exist and maybe Mark
would agree with me, but I've seen some
[SPEAKER_10]: literature out there that the
endocannabinoid system has evolved even
[SPEAKER_10]: pre-human.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that's been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty well known that it
is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're all on the same page then.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that's evolved in nature.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's evolved in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans were actually created so that we
could fulfill our endocannabinoid intake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's happened here is the plant has
survived and the system itself of how we
[SPEAKER_10]: absorb it became part of our fundamental
DNA and it's part of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting is that the key word
that Mark is talking about is probably why
[SPEAKER_10]: he's on Hash Church pushing cannabis and
not in the mainstream is distribution.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we look at the soda industry,
we look at the music industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: you look at any kind of industry,
those who controls the channels and the
[SPEAKER_10]: way of distribution and retail control the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So same thing with music.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a huge record label and you're
buying up airtime on the radio and you're,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh great, my computer is about to go to a
gazillion checkings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: This always happens to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on a second, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: This always happens to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're able to control that just like
somebody is like, oh, I'm going to create
[SPEAKER_10]: a new soda and I worked on this project in
2004, 2005, the first Net Zero soda.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Helps you burn calories instead of giving
you calories.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was this amazing type of thing,
but guess who controls the distribution of
[SPEAKER_10]: soda?
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's only two companies and
therefore you're going to bow down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with what this guy's taught,
what Peter's talking about here is he's
[SPEAKER_10]: like, hey, listen, I made a trillion parts
per million or trillion parts probiotic
[SPEAKER_10]: for plants that will do all this amazing
stuff that is a huge need right now,
[SPEAKER_10]: especially in the micro world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the distribution channels and the
people that are actually making money are
[SPEAKER_10]: making money off of crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're selling crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, hey, this is great crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, that's the exact thing is what
I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like 60 bucks a case.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sell Roundup at Home Depot like it's
a fucking like a Pepsi Cola.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're so right on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so there's so with the radio,
that's why serious radio came out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why salad radio, no commercials,
because for a while there and it's it's
[SPEAKER_10]: funny as you study these like these
generational changes for a while there,
[SPEAKER_10]: we only had radio.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was I was reading up on people that
are born between 78 and 83, which is 77
[SPEAKER_10]: and 83, which is myself, where it's called
the micro generation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not the generation X or the
millennium, but we grew up in a stage
[SPEAKER_10]: where as kids we had analog.
[SPEAKER_10]: In college, we had digital.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there was a time where there was no
digital phones.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no we took a picture and exposed
it right away on our camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to wait two weeks, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's happened is in that boom,
in that generation, they found ways to
[SPEAKER_10]: make money.
[SPEAKER_10]: They found ways to cut tape.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now Mark's talking about the EPA.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's like, oh, let's cut down the
tape.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's let's make this easier for us to
sell more crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what that does is it keeps it's about
money instead of about the human
[SPEAKER_10]: relationship in the species.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could see why you might have a
tremendous hard time getting this into the
[SPEAKER_10]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could tell you in California versus
the rest of the country for for farming
[SPEAKER_10]: and growing herbs in Europe for the
consumer, I would put them at the highest
[SPEAKER_10]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think your market's California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really has been California's been
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the states have been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just isolated pockets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me let me expand the north.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: The northwest.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Washington, Oregon, California area of
the United States.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to leave out my friends up
north because they are extremely conscious
[SPEAKER_10]: in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Mark was talking about is pretty
pretty right on point because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what what what we're trying to
do to get the product out with regards to
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution, just to kind of give you a
very high level overview of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are really in the belief that the
product will speak and sell for itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can put it in the hands of you
guys and put it in the hands of the right
[SPEAKER_04]: people that can actually see for their own
eyes the power of of just simply adding
[SPEAKER_04]: the right biodiversity to their crop,
then you're you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: share this message and kind of a
grassroots movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's my ideal marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been doing for the long
run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I have so many sustainable
organic cultivators using this product is
[SPEAKER_04]: not because I have a huge marketing
budget, but I'm keeping the cost low.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working with the right light beings
that are able to get this out because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're tuning in to how important it is
for their own environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it and it and it it almost like
relates or balances out with the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a relative synergy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I the only one that just saw the light
beam come over his right shoulder over the
[SPEAKER_10]: last few minutes?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you see the light beam?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I saw it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you were talking about that,
look to your look on camera and look where
[SPEAKER_10]: you're children's pictures are.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a beam of light that wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's shining right down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's shining down as you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want you to know, I ordered two bags
of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're probably right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's what Mark was talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a shame because the EPA is like,
OK, this is something that the map that's
[SPEAKER_10]: billions of dollars across the United
States of consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether it's adult use or quote unquote
medicine that people and humans in the
[SPEAKER_10]: public are consuming, it is our fiduciary
right and our duty to study the effects of
[SPEAKER_10]: pesticides on plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's interesting that now they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, the beams in front of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know it's not on on the wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on your it's right across you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Peter, let me paint a different
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 280 goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis gets delisted and you are bought
hook, line and sinker by Scott's Miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: Grove or another multinational corporation
looking to get never going to fucking bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kind of like playing devil's
advocate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same thing to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But didn't Mark used to work for one of
those companies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really I really would like to have them
assimilate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is something so important to
me that I'd love to kind of share with you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys on church weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, listen to this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so within the balance of the of the
micro world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's a light and there's a
dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a shadow and there's a light,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The pathogens we see them as shadow they
take from our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kill our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you extrapolate that to humans,
right, we all have within ourselves in a
[SPEAKER_04]: shadow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have suffering.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have things that we're trying to
alleviate within within ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the idea that I've seen with our
product, which resonates so clearly with
[SPEAKER_04]: us, because I feel like we're so here to
to take care of the of the plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: nurture the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we've been given all of these
abilities, these abilities to love and
[SPEAKER_04]: nurture and and want to be loved and care
for these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why we can energetically tune into
the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're actually able to to rechannel
a lot of that shadow energy that's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: into us, you know, a lot of that anger,
a lot of that fear, a lot of that pain,
[SPEAKER_04]: rechannel it into a compassionate place,
a consciousness and actually come from a
[SPEAKER_04]: place of giving in a place of gratitude
and abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: That energy will extrapolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just like our our micro organisms
do, it doesn't allow room for a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: those pathogens to gain competency or gain
traction or, you know, there's just
[SPEAKER_04]: health.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just, you know, this high level
energy of good, good love and mostly
[SPEAKER_04]: compassion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I've seen this product
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a compassionate product for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps them healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you're talking about with
regards to distribution and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the big evil guys, they're they're not
they're not evil.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the humans on this earth are evil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all just in a certain place or a
point of suffering.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just looking for a product to
push.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the product they have to push.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, if we if we can break
through to where we're all on a balanced
[SPEAKER_04]: playing field, then then, you know,
all these chemical companies could help a
[SPEAKER_04]: technology like mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could they could they could embrace
it and add it as a part of what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: innately been created as a human being.
[SPEAKER_04]: To do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what Mark saying anti greed
pill first, because greed blinds everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, when people want to do
stuff like that, they just put their
[SPEAKER_02]: blindfold on greed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we end up with a bunch of other crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, we end up with chemical companies
like Monsanto selling us a and telling us
[SPEAKER_02]: what a great thing it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has to be great because now it's
in mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recognize that shadow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to recognize that shadow and re
channel it and allow them to re channel it
[SPEAKER_04]: into into compassion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will if they're given the
opportunity and they have the right
[SPEAKER_04]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not ignore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to look at it openly and say,
look, these people are doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I agree with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I just ordered two bags of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been looking into living soil and
plants for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only grown in fresh rabbit poo,
earthworms, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always felt like the bugs and worms
were not really the best biology for
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's well, but I felt like they
were the micro engineers and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: they would attract the rest of the work
crews along that would make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always grew plants for 56 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always grew really good plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And never experienced a lot of the things
that seem to attack a lot of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays that I hear friends have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always try to make our soil alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always seemed to be the right path
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ordered two bags of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to use it this season on all
of my bush and skunk plants that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ordered a couple trillion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and then what Mark is saying is that
if your strategy, if you create something
[SPEAKER_10]: that's good and your and your mission is
is is good for humans and the planet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like you said, they're just put the
distribution companies are just pushing
[SPEAKER_10]: what they're told to push.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, hey, we've got product A,
we've got product B.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to set up fifteen hundred
salespeople across the country and they're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to sell product A and they're going
to sell product B.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not a sellout if you get a
contract with this with a distribution
[SPEAKER_10]: company or a record label, if you will,
that says, OK, I just created something
[SPEAKER_10]: that's ten times better than than what you
have on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you have to work on something that
would be like a repeal and replace type of
[SPEAKER_10]: policy where you start implementing repeal
and replace your products with my
[SPEAKER_10]: products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could find a distributor that
says we currently have 95 percent of the
[SPEAKER_10]: market share of crap that can harm humans
in the environment, you're like,
[SPEAKER_10]: great, I would like to see my product over
the next 10, 20 and 30 years repeal and
[SPEAKER_10]: replace that 95 percent down to zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's you know, that's literally
what Paul Stamets is doing right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he is literally producing all these
incredible, unique products based on
[SPEAKER_08]: things that he's learned from the mushroom
and literally like from pesticide and
[SPEAKER_08]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he's able to control insects with
with different funguses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you you're aware of Paul's work,
I'm sure, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way you picked up my mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've had a brief conversation with
Paul and he's doing some some amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really happy for him and his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very different than what we're
doing, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's similar in the sense of what Tony
was just saying to be able to like his
[SPEAKER_08]: work is the same in the sense that
everything he's doing is is beneficial and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's about giving and it's about producing
this information that's like using nature
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of deadly chemicals instead of
like harsh poisons.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that that's where the similarity,
I think, was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're we really believe that,
you know, one of the most advanced
[SPEAKER_04]: technologies on this earth that we can
learn from and utilize is nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's that's and retuning our
energetic into that beautiful sacred and
[SPEAKER_04]: working is what a lot of you guys are
already doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're feeling that and that's such an
attunement to the plants that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, when I talk about it,
I feel like I really resonate with with a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the cannabis cultivators,
though understanding that that energetic
[SPEAKER_04]: connection that they have with their
plants and and and and giving it the right
[SPEAKER_04]: things is just almost like this this
desire that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give it the best so that these
guys, their energy can just help and heal
[SPEAKER_04]: and give to the to the people that you're
serving, other humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that resonance is happening,
you know, with or without me or with or
[SPEAKER_04]: without what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already started and it's a beautiful
thing in my lifetime to be a part of,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your bacteria a stomach of a worm?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I was talking to you
about earlier was how our product creates
[SPEAKER_04]: humus, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So an earthworm, as it's going through the
soil, what it does is it eats carbon and
[SPEAKER_04]: its excrement is is actually humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the most bioavailable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's hydrophilic, which means it
retains moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very good for the soil and all the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: In it are bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that process, but doing it
exponentially faster with saprophytic
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms that are found in soil balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our guys will attach to carbon because
saprophytes eat carbon just like a worm
[SPEAKER_04]: does.
[SPEAKER_04]: We decompose it on a microscopic level
around the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're getting a bunch of earthworms
around your roots if you if you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's decomposing all of that
carbon, making it bioavailable right on
[SPEAKER_04]: your root, right on your root with these
small little guys, these little these
[SPEAKER_04]: little microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do your microorganisms live through
the gut of a worm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it poops out, are they
microorganisms still active?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we actually increase all kinds of
worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We increase beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know that beneficial nematodes eat
humus and plant parasitic nematodes eat
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I've been using nematodes for almost
40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The humus, the beneficial nematodes grow
naturally in our soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was a little off subject,
but it reminds me of when I was 2000,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe five.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back then I was a general contractor and
working with my brother in Florida.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we had started a construction site and
they generally give you engineering and
[SPEAKER_10]: site plans that tell you like the last 40,
60 years of what they have documented,
[SPEAKER_10]: depending on the city and how well the
documents are done.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we had started to drill the piles and
stuff and hit like an unforeseen oil tank
[SPEAKER_10]: that somebody just buried on this land.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was no permit for it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we drilled right into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of a sudden there was like 40 feet
deep.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is in Florida.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're hitting water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now there's like a barrier,
very, very small between the top and then
[SPEAKER_10]: as the water table.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so maybe it was probably, maybe it
wasn't 40 feet deep.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were trying to drill deeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, I think it was, it might've been
10 feet under the soil, but it was buried.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: EPA had to get involved.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll never forget this story because I
was like, man, we are fucked.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's millions of dollars on the line.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody, you know, you're building these
like projects and they had hired a
[SPEAKER_10]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was to meet him because I was the
project manager and this thing was shut
[SPEAKER_10]: down, EPA, everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how are you going to clean up the
environment?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the number came in around 55,000 for
the specialist to come in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was, my brother was like,
yeah, he's a bug specialist.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what do you mean a bug
specialist?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he invented and he creates these bio
bugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, you'll see, you'll see this
guy's, this guy's known around the
[SPEAKER_10]: country.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he came in and we had a big hole on the
site.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking, you know, you could walk
around it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was probably good 40 feet around this
thing, all centered out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a guy was kind of a,
not a cowboy hat, but like a adventurer
[SPEAKER_10]: hat, if you will.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had just like a button up and just
seemed like a normal guy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, yeah, don't worry about it,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, I've got this, he's got two
containers about this big.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he just went around throwing these
bugs, microorganisms around, around the
[SPEAKER_10]: dirt, not even on where the oil was.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as he went around, these things hit
the dirt and went like into the soil
[SPEAKER_10]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_10]: They ate all of the oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: They pooped out like phosphorus or
something and then died.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they decomposed into some other
natural element.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was like the craziest shit I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: They ate all the oil in a course of five
days.
[SPEAKER_10]: He put trillions of like these organism
bugs that he designed and created.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, I came back and I was
like, what the fuck happened to the oil?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the next question of course came
to me, which was, well, why don't they use
[SPEAKER_10]: this on other oil spills and different
things like in the water?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember saying that to him and he's
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, but you know, I work with the
EPA sometimes and it seemed like it was a
[SPEAKER_10]: technical technology that was easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: He could make a lot of it, but there was a
lot of control and different elements and
[SPEAKER_10]: agencies between the source and reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bio products today, it's kind of a
unique thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a fifth for a lot out there and
there's so many crazy different things
[SPEAKER_04]: that for the EPA and how they do their
system, it's like, if you're a chemical,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really easy to get passed through,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a natural product, that's not
true at all, but it's still, it can be
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhat of a different process.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's so many like- The body does try
to get rid of chemicals though quickly,
[SPEAKER_10]: but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's referring to EPA
registration, registration of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're saying is that there's a
chemical than it is to regenerate a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological so I do have some experience in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can tell you is that they have
a category of biopesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticides are things like bacteria,
probiotics, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get those registered, you still
have to go through the same tranche,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the difficult thing about a
biopesticide is really the production and
[SPEAKER_01]: the consistency of it and being able to
categorize it because you have to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: register what the active ingredient is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, I mean, this is a
biological thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily like a fungicide
where there is like an active ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: that's formulated at a certain percentage
in the rest of the- That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: For them, it's easier to kind of
understand because they know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity of that one ingredient and all
the other crap and starch that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation really has nothing to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that single active
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that respect, you're right,
it's clear that they can- That active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient based on the safety and the
efficacy of that, where with a biological,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little bit more about, I use the
analogy of throwing sand down at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beach, a biological additive into a
pre-existing biological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard in a way to your efficacy
in terms of like an active ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: level like you would if it were a single
active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or let's forget about agrochemicals,
just think about aspirin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspirin's efficacy in the human body is
directly correlated to the dose of aspirin
[SPEAKER_01]: you get, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dose of your product that's
effective is gonna be really a- It's just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a little bit more difficult to
characterize if it were a single
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient, which were just happened to be
a chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the thing with biological
control, and as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are actually part of a team that
registered a insect repellent underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: the FIFRA guidelines of what is a
biopesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was based on a plant oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chemically modified a plant oil and we
created this new insect repellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still had to get it tested for both
efficacy and human safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out the human safety tests
alone just to warrant bringing that
[SPEAKER_01]: package to the Environmental Protection
Agency who then is gonna look at it and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, okay, based on your safety,
based on your use rate, based on how this
[SPEAKER_01]: is manufactured, we grant you a
registration to sell that product,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the really high expensive
hurdle that you typically need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some big ass company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the expense on and be able to do all
the talk studies and be able to do like
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the impact, not just on the soil,
which is where your product comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: contact, but what's the impact
systemically on other things that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: affected when your product's administered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's a great thing what
you're doing, Peter, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be difficult for the EPA to get
their arms around registering stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use and especially for in light
of this latest thing from the EPA,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Scott Pruitt, where he basically is
just taking the position of, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is gonna enable the cannabis
industry, which is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bam, we're not gonna give anyone
registrations for anything having to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this doesn't help the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really help to make that kind
of decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to go back to your notion of the
bio, the biological means to control I
[SPEAKER_01]: think is gonna be what you're gonna rely
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what, like if you look at the
list of what's allowed in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same list of what's allowed in
Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the minimum use rate,
sort of pesticides minimum efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't really have a whole lot
of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are biological control
agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what your company is looking to do
is improve on that from the roots down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's a much, much better
application than, say, applying something
[SPEAKER_01]: to the vascular system of the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, one of the things that a lot of
people, from a microbiology standpoint and
[SPEAKER_04]: is that, let's say if you're making
compost tea, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've created an aerobic, beautiful
humus compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've made gorgeous composts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still gonna be pockets that are
undecomposed within that compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you create a tea, there are some
very small microscopic pockets that are
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna possess undecomposed pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you create a compost tea,
you have to be really careful that your
[SPEAKER_04]: good guys are higher than your bad guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really where our product comes
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta get really high amounts of good
guys so that the bad guys don't have a
[SPEAKER_04]: chance to infect you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we make no claims as any type of a
biofungicide or a pesticide or any of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've never even tested for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know if our product works on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we do know is that the health is
exponentially enhanced when you have just
[SPEAKER_04]: a ton of good guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what organic growers are
finding all over the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've done is we've taken those
same good guys that are conducively found
[SPEAKER_04]: on the roots of those soils and those
healthy plants that just are healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've just increased them and we're
adding them to the cannabis plant in
[SPEAKER_04]: larger numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're the same strains that you could
just pull right out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can eat them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from the EPA's standpoint,
they're okay with that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mycorrhizae, babysyllus subtilis,
all these strains, they're getting out
[SPEAKER_04]: there and people are starting to really
see the benefit of adding probiotics to
[SPEAKER_04]: their plants just like we do our own
bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe it or not, as you do that,
a lot of the strains and what they'll
[SPEAKER_04]: create will actually enhance the natural
strains that are found in that environment
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're cultivating in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like one talks to the other
and they all kind of come alive again and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's just a... Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot to do with the mineral
holding capacity of the soil and a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with moisture holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're doing is you're populating
the biome down there that again,
[SPEAKER_01]: creates as well as it consumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, no, I totally believe in the
approach you're taking and wish you all
[SPEAKER_01]: the best in trying to get these products
distributed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's been kind of the
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really trying to keep the price low.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the goal with this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to stick to our roots,
which is to be able to give this product
[SPEAKER_04]: to the cannabis cultivator at an
affordable price.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not here to rape the market or take
advantage of the margins that you guys are
[SPEAKER_04]: making.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've studied the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the margins aren't epic,
so we're not here to... But we are here to
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize the connection that you guys have
and the fact that you guys can believe in
[SPEAKER_04]: the biology because you can see it so well
within your terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for us, we know we're going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be able to get the product
out on its own accord because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in 30 days, you can see what this
product will do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll be apparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that being said, once we're able
to get enough people and good growers and
[SPEAKER_04]: good energies involved in this,
it'll just naturally spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those distribution channels
and business and economic models hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: will be able to circumvent a lot of that
and keep the price low.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I grow big, I'm going to try and keep
this price even lower so that it gets out
[SPEAKER_04]: even more and more and more because adding
life to the soil is conducive to our
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term sustainment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my job is to give.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to align with other givers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I was raised.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I was raised by an Italian mother
who taught me to just give.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I hope the people that I
align with will give, will pay it forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there won't be just one channel of
energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be an awareness where we all
realize we are that light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we grasp onto it and continue to
give and take care of our plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: nurture our environment, we'll be here
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll have a light beacon shine in
this galaxy if we're able to really heal
[SPEAKER_04]: and nurture that environment with
compassion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need the tools to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tools that we have have been
evolved right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're finding that they're not working
very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Chimera to the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: He popped in a little while ago and has
been nice and quiet, not to disturb.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing there, Chimera?
[SPEAKER_11]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really great contributions, Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chimera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Chimera just got back from the event
out in, what was it, the ICRS or the IRSC?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, ICRS is the International Cnavenoid
Research Society.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a conference every year with all
the top minds from the neuroscience field
[SPEAKER_11]: that are studying cannabinoid receptors
and how the cannabinoid receptors and all
[SPEAKER_11]: the entire endocannabinoid system really
works.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's a lot of synthetic compounds
and mice studies and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they also look at cannabis a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: There wasn't any really big talks on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a bunch of posters on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Mark Ware and all those folks did
some presentations on all the human
[SPEAKER_11]: studies that are being done.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a really interesting conference.
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't typically, they ask you not
to share the info because it's such a
[SPEAKER_11]: small community.
[SPEAKER_11]: What it is is people, they all get
together and they share their data before
[SPEAKER_11]: it gets published.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that helps kind of sell off peer
review the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: But people don't really like it when you
share their info.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did get permission from one of the
groups to share some of the things they've
[SPEAKER_11]: been working on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, how are you guys all doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a pretty good conversation about
bacteria and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sam had a really good sort of point
talking about the synthase and whether if
[SPEAKER_08]: the synthase isn't there, you're not going
to get that particular production of this
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoid or that terpene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe another conversation for another day
you might want to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll have to review what he said.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one, I don't know if you guys can
actually see the screen I'm sharing at
[SPEAKER_11]: this point in time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so let me just try and make it nice
and big.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'm going to go about this a
different way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a company called Napro
Research.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're based down in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do support for cultivators and
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some people might know of a company
called Phytex, which is Ethan Russo's
[SPEAKER_11]: company.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they approach this whole terpene
thing, trying to figure out a terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: class, as it was mentioned briefly on
Church last week.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to put up the analytical
method that they used.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people have an understanding,
and they can go and look it up and see
[SPEAKER_11]: that this is the method here that they
used for all the work that's going to
[SPEAKER_11]: follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called a development and validation
of a reliable and robust method for the
[SPEAKER_11]: analysis of cannabinoids and terpenes and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a great paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really the first.
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper where they showed a very laborious
method for actually quantifying terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: the way that we quantify cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the previous works were,
I don't know, Mark Sheldon might care to
[SPEAKER_11]: comment on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think they were really more
approximations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were doing pretty much what they
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing it 20 years earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using the GCFID to determine the
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the statistical robustness of this
particular paper is pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I guess my comment was
predicated on the fact that terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis in cannabis has been done for
more than a half a century now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the first people to look at it
was early on just to sort of do it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very descriptive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it was actually isolated and
things were were fractionated and then
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes were sort of became more
prevalent, I guess, when Ethan and others
[SPEAKER_01]: started looking at the so-called entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what sets this analysis method
apart is that it was really the first
[SPEAKER_11]: method to robustly quantify terpenes per
milligram in a sample.
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you say that's true, Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's statistically valid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people have measured, again,
I go back to the papers from the mid-70s
[SPEAKER_01]: where people did measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, this is just more
statistically robust on modern
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation reviewed by a more
knowledgeable peer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to agree also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 20 years ago, this is basically
the methodology we were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we came to that conclusion
was by talking to the very top people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of terpene analysis being done
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they carried it out to this and
published it in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to a very similar conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen this one too.
[SPEAKER_10]: This does give you the quantified of like
milligrams and everything you're saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this paper... It's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: This paper is to help... Is this going to
be like the method that labs in the future
[SPEAKER_08]: will use to... No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they should use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one method.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: These things always develop over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the interesting things...
[SPEAKER_01]: Headspace analysis algorithms into the
modern cannabis instrumentation that's
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are Shimazu instruments,
but both Shimazu and Agilent instruments
[SPEAKER_01]: do make basically the same... The thing
that measures basically the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be measuring either
a sample, if you're injecting it or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just measuring headspace,
I think headspace is really cool if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a temperature ramp, especially with
hash, because you can look to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of volatilization of the terpenes
you're actually getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know that everything that goes
through a GC is being heated up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is some chemistry that could
happen at these temperatures with these
[SPEAKER_01]: fragile molecules.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've got something else to talk about
on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also tested headspace analysis and
found it inappropriate for... If you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine what your terpene percentages
and profiles are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking kind of like what Marcus
and I have discussed in previous episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: with the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to like volatilize off of
like a titanium versus a ceramic versus
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of impact on what the
headspace molecules can be just because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean services or not clean services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're significant differences,
it would be interesting to determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just like when I make water
hash, certain terpenes stay present right
[SPEAKER_08]: till the end and they're profound and
they're loud and other ones get washed
[SPEAKER_08]: away in the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be interesting to see if there
are certain terpenes that are more easily
[SPEAKER_08]: preserved from surface heat to taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, versus other ones that... Go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of goes back to that
cannabinoid water thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone tested their hash water for,
you know, what trace amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids or terpenes might be in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a product concept around,
you know, spent water from hashing
[SPEAKER_01]: operations that could be... I'm not
thinking maybe for a human consumable,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we were talking about a little bit on
the Facebook chat, which was maybe putting
[SPEAKER_01]: it into animal feed and animal food
because it's giving them some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemical extract fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: God knows what the hell's in there,
but... Well, I would say this much,
[SPEAKER_08]: without being, you know, even having a
science degree, without knowing much about
[SPEAKER_08]: much, any old human, you know,
especially if you have a fondness for
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, if you smell the cold bubble
water and even taste it, it's just...
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and we had this long conversation
the other day, Space and I just drinking
[SPEAKER_10]: the water and just drink the water that
comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll give you, you know, different
rinses, the first rinse versus the second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever tested to see like how much
cannabinoids... I mean, be it that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are not water soluble,
but that's the matter of, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking at PPB and PPM levels,
can we find cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this cannabinoid water that is
being sold for 60 bucks a case,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, if you do the calculation and try
to figure out they would have to drink of
[SPEAKER_01]: that water to get like an efficacious dose
for like an epilepsy patient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be like a train car full of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's not enough cannabinoids in
some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the questions aside on whether or not
that actually has some type of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, homeopathic biological efficacy
in the body when you're just drinking
[SPEAKER_01]: water that has trace amounts of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me say this, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, recently Tony sent me the terpene
sugars and the terpene syrups,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess I put a glass full of water
and tried the terpene syrup and put a
[SPEAKER_08]: little of that of the xylitol,
the terp sugar, as he calls it in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, yeah, have a sip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh yeah, wow, that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of reminded me of bubble water to
a degree, other than the fact that it was
[SPEAKER_08]: totally clean and the way it dispersed was
alien.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: It just like, I dropped this syrup in and
it just turned into these little worms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the worms turned into blur.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden the water kind of
was a little foggy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, that's fucking trippy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I tasted this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's talking to me on the phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, that's neat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I sit down at my desk and I'm like,
high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, dude, I almost feel like the way
I feel like when you eat mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_08]: you're not quite high on mushrooms yet,
but you know, but you know, you're about
[SPEAKER_08]: to get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was a climbing sort of like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's crazy about that is as far as the
terpene are concerned, trying to find a
[SPEAKER_10]: way to get them to go into water the right
way, but without using as much to bring
[SPEAKER_10]: the price way down and not have any THC or
CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then as we got to that pure level,
something happens because it's like,
[SPEAKER_10]: okay, well if terpenes are found in fruits
and vegetables and cannabis, and they
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely play a significant part in our
endocannabinoid system, whatever they're
[SPEAKER_10]: turning on, whatever they're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found water was a very, water or liquids
was a really good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get too deep into the
conversation, I want to reiterate that,
[SPEAKER_08]: okay, I'm not claiming the terpenes
themselves got me high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always dabbing all day long.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had dabbed 15 or 20 minutes prior,
but listen, I understand the feeling and
[SPEAKER_08]: the difference from that dab and then 15
minutes later drinking this terpene water,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially without any like he wasn't
like, oh, how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_08]: I told him, I was like, dude, I feel high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, well, you know,
we talk about modulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're obviously your body's full
of cannabinoids right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think that there would,
and I didn't think that there would be not
[SPEAKER_08]: the same way I smoke and experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but maybe, maybe it was undeniable
in your particular case, the water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction unlocks something, you know,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was just gonna say now the water
that we're talking about from the hash,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's another market to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's ever booming markets in
California.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about terpenes and
fragrances.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if he pulls up that other chart,
okay, so you see, so there was another
[SPEAKER_10]: chart that Chimera had that he didn't want
to show us.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like color coordinated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if you could show us that one real
quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he missed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's another one.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a different chart you had that
you didn't want to show us yet,
[SPEAKER_10]: but this is good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So essentially what's happening is like,
you know, I went to Trader Joe's,
[SPEAKER_10]: I got some water that had like lemon and
ginger, natural flavoring in water,
[SPEAKER_10]: added the Jack Frost to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried the Jack Frost on its own in
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I tried it paired with lemon and
ginger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, which is, you could see the lemon
that's on this chart.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was another different,
it was another slightly different feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I didn't do it right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried them, you know, spaced out
different, different days.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could tell you that there is
something happening on a level there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be interesting to pair it with
probiotics and terpenes now that we're
[SPEAKER_10]: talking about probiotics and what profound
effects we could work on in the gut for
[SPEAKER_10]: people that have leaky gut, IBS,
Crohn's, poor digestive systems,
[SPEAKER_10]: not functioning properly, enzymes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, ultimately the water that's
coming from the hash water will have a
[SPEAKER_10]: different, lots of different markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's people selling rose water
hydrosol sprays just for your face.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's not in the men's industry as
much, but you know, somebody sprayed me
[SPEAKER_10]: with like a rose water with some kind of
cannabis hydrosol in the face,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and I was like, oh, that's
really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it was like a mist.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's definitely, when you're talking
about not just drinking it, but definitely
[SPEAKER_10]: something in the hash water that's
fragrance.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be used as maybe bong water.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be used as a spray, but I'm
definitely going to, the next step that
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do is test the flour,
test the resin that's made from the flour
[SPEAKER_10]: with all of the microns that have been
separated, dry the flour, test that dried
[SPEAKER_10]: flour, and then take that water,
like you just said, and test that for
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids and test that for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm going to vac freeze that and
try to separate the water out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, there are people that are
boiling that with a sill, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_10]: try to do it without any temperatures.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I could test everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe we would have something a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony, let's make, let's make some space
for Ryan for a second so he can,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tied back to that, but yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Opening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you there, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's opening, opening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it comes back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll call back.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what the significance of what his
first opening conversation was the testing
[SPEAKER_10]: factors, you know, so we have to get an
accurate way to test these things and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and really have a standard, you know,
so that everyone says, oh, that's,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're using this equipment with this head
space with this thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two, the two discussed in the paper,
the GCFID and the HPLC method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good start at that kind of
a thing, but it would have to be widely
[SPEAKER_00]: used before it's a standardized method.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I know it was a little bit drawn
out and we can tend to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: distracted, but I just, I hope you guys
can just kind of follow with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I'm trying to paint like a long
story picture so that you can see the
[SPEAKER_11]: whole process of how these guys went about
this work.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, this was the analytical method.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about it a little bit and they
use it to generate a lab report format
[SPEAKER_11]: called the FIDOFAX.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these here are, this is a FIDOFAX,
the FIDOFAX layout.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a webpage that's called
FIDOFAX.
[SPEAKER_11]: dot info.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can go and plug in like blue dream
or G or, you know, some of these keywords
[SPEAKER_11]: Kush, and you'll start seeing all the FIDO
prints come up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the FIDO print is a really,
or the FIDOFAX are really interesting lab
[SPEAKER_11]: report format that, uh, provides
information on, you know, on, on obviously
[SPEAKER_11]: flower samples and the hash samples or
even terpene samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it consists of this bar graph on
top, which shows, your quantified levels
[SPEAKER_11]: of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like say you have, so you actually,
you can see that like this one is a 12.3,
[SPEAKER_11]: 12.36% total cannabinoids, 1.34% total
terpene compliment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just under 7% moisture.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second part here is, is called what
they call the canadile.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it represents the ratio of the top two
terpene or the top two cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in this case, it's the small sliver is
CBG acid and the big piece of the pie is
[SPEAKER_11]: THC acid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we go down at the bottom and we've
got, which is essentially a terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: fingerprint that's done based on color.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, it's a really interesting way to
look at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, when you first look at it,
you don't really, it doesn't make,
[SPEAKER_11]: it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
but eventually what happens is you learn
[SPEAKER_11]: the colors of the terpenes and you don't
have to go back and read like,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you'll know that limonene,
for example, is yellow, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: The pynines are green.
[SPEAKER_11]: Linalool is this like purple color and
myrcin is this lavender kind of color.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, myrcin is this more dark maroon
kind of color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've taken a page out of the bubble bag
page.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you, you're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in that same way that you know that
the color, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: The 73 is the yellow, the 90 is the black.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have, you don't have to go and
look it up every time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you see the yellow bag, you just know
that's the 73.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, it's not like SC labs format
where they have, you know, they actually
[SPEAKER_11]: demonstrate 34 or 32 or whatever it is
terpenes on a graph.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are limited to 17 because the
17, these 17 are all known to be
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmacologically active for one.
[SPEAKER_11]: But two, they're also the most prevalent
ones that appear in like the majority of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis samples.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they're, they're the most useful
for discriminating, um, a class system
[SPEAKER_11]: that you can use to separate, you know,
like the wine analogy before it separates
[SPEAKER_11]: like a merlot from a pinot noir from a
Shiraz, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So these, this terpene data that you see
here at the bottom is actually what the
[SPEAKER_11]: aroma and the entree.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see this left side of this
panel here is the aroma.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the flavor, you can see there's two
different graphs laid over top of each
[SPEAKER_11]: other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the right panel is the predicted
entourage effect from the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that fascinates me right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is super coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, it is going to be the way of the
future, you know, because people,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can go into a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can look at the chemical profile of
the plant and then you can say,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this is the type of effect that
it's going to have.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's super cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, check out the webpage again.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's phytofacts.info.
Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phytofacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think most laboratories would be
able to adopt something like, like that
[SPEAKER_04]: type of a disclosure of information within
their... Well, they license their
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology and their, their, their,
uh, phytofacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can license it from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very user friendly, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, I just searched dream to
pull up like blue dreams, but like here's,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a bunch of different varieties
that are all based on different blue dream
[SPEAKER_11]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like, but so we'll just look at
blue dream for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see again, mere scene is this
purple one at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the dominant terpene, um,
which is really, you know, it's sedative,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sedative terpene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this sample has more pynenes than
the last one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then actually very little limonene.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, go around and play with all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Search whatever terms you want.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the search engine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, I think, I think you'll find it
interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once they, once they searched,
once they did like, you know, hundreds or
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands and thousands of tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did they get their biological data
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Their efficacy, like what's gonna,
you know, you said that you had one graph
[SPEAKER_01]: where they showed, you know, a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'm not, not for a disease or a
therapeutic area, but can you go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that one chart?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're asking how do they tie,
um, this data to effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what is this exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so see relaxation, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see this one is high in
relaxations.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also high in mere scene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's that sedative property of,
of how many, how many, uh, cultivars they
[SPEAKER_10]: have in the data.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the first 14 I typed in.
[SPEAKER_10]: None came up until I typed in gorilla
glue.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: But do something like type in gorilla or
glue, because a lot of times you get
[SPEAKER_11]: variations on the name, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's like, it didn't have granddaddy
perps.
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't have true OG.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean just like type in OG type perps
type perps type OG.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like for example, I'll just go to the top
and type OG.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Size of the relaxation wedge, just a
statistical correlation to how much mere
[SPEAKER_01]: scene is in the sample.
[SPEAKER_11]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's heavily weighted on mere scene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, all the other terpenes do have
effects, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the other categories of
effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had relaxation was one that's the
mercy one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, wouldn't, wouldn't that be more,
I mean, I would say like, I like the
[SPEAKER_10]: words.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's not a medical term,
but I mean, more of like a hypnotic or
[SPEAKER_11]: medical would be more hypnotic or remember
duty in the United States.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can't use, I mean, it's like,
yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus energy inspiration, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Inspiration is highly tied to limonene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus is, is it, is, is which one again,
pining?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tied to pining, which is weird on
this sample because the pining are
[SPEAKER_11]: actually, oh, they're the third dominant
term.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a small effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a less weighted score in the
overall.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not, again, I'm not exactly sure of
the exact algorithm, but there's obviously
[SPEAKER_11]: an algorithm behind it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how would I pull up any sour D's on
this or just sour anything sour or diesel?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like let's go dead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing came up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'm retarded here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they just don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no data on sour diesel or sour
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's almost right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem.
[SPEAKER_08]: See if they have anything in the chem
family.
[SPEAKER_08]: Opening time machine preferences.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just hate computers
sometimes?
[SPEAKER_10]: They have cushions like classic public
cushions.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the whole layout and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, where are they located to,
so people can get things tested or get
[SPEAKER_10]: their information to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a public laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Service laboratory.
[SPEAKER_11]: They only work with certain dispensary and
cultivator clients for data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gets a better system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the best system at the present
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's unique other than a nice color
coded graph thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could finish.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting bogged down in the,
in the, in the thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I w that was just a tool that I was
showing you.
[SPEAKER_11]: To go and play with and, and experiment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to present you vital facts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to present you something
greater here, which is this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after running tons and tons of tests,
they started to, these terpene classes
[SPEAKER_11]: started to emerge, which is what Josh was
talking about, or sorry, what Alec was
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about last week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is really the work that,
that predated all of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see, like, for example,
let's look at limonene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this limonene class here, these are all
different types of samples where limonene
[SPEAKER_11]: is the highest terpene present in the
sample.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: What you, what we're talking about a
couple of weeks ago with Tim's county
[SPEAKER_11]: fair, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You were basing it on the five dominant
terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was saying, I mean, it's a start,
but it doesn't really show you the
[SPEAKER_11]: variation that can occur within that,
within plants that are all limonene
[SPEAKER_11]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this has gone and broken it down.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see that what we call,
what was called the gold class or the gold
[SPEAKER_11]: subclass in the limonene superclass,
that is when limonene is roughly equal to
[SPEAKER_11]: karyophyllene and roughly equal to
myrcene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's going to have a different
effect when limonene is greater than
[SPEAKER_11]: karyophyllene and roughly equal to
myrcene.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's interesting because Peter came
in earlier and talked about having some of
[SPEAKER_08]: the plants that they had grown with his
probiotics, the bacteria is that,
[SPEAKER_08]: that a higher, like instead of two or
three, there was like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_08]: classes of terpenes that had similar
amounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we don't see that very often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I haven't anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one that I just got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can share my screen here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a cool way to, so at this
conference real quick, this is what you
[SPEAKER_10]: went to and this is a really cool way to
start the process of really dialing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the table of elements for
cannabis and terpene classifications.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the first really comprehensive
classification system for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you can see if you count the
classes, it's got one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_11]: four, five, six, seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got eight different terpene classes
in this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas the county fair that they were,
they're only using five different classes,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have an osamine class.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have a little oil class and
they didn't have a humulant class.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now look at what Peter's got.
[SPEAKER_10]: See if you have anything that matches
this, what he's got on that chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy that did this test, he was at 0.3
before he used the soil balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, not a massive, master grower like
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a regular guy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a cannabis cup dude like you guys are,
just a humble guy who's creating medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: in his yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: No CO2, open loop is how we did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this laboratory only tests for these
particular ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all they test for.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this guy, the laboratory, they said
that they had three others that were over
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.1.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these were the only ones that that
particular laboratory tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably was up close around 2%.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all relatively very close.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing that is makes, you know,
and it's really interesting to look at
[SPEAKER_11]: individual results and I'm not trying to
talk smack about those results.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing that we know that happens
when you go from cultivation to
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivation to cultivation, the
environmental, the environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions change and that can actually
impact the order of the terpenes on the,
[SPEAKER_11]: in the sample.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was that, look at this though.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a kosher kush where his mercine,
except the lime means just a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: higher, but he's almost fitting right into
your gold series.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just looking at the chart that's
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple of them on there that
have three or four that equal each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the things that they did in this
is that all the, all the plants were grown
[SPEAKER_11]: in the same exact same conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you do that, you eliminate the
environmental effects and therefore you
[SPEAKER_11]: can get a better representation of the
actual impact of the genetics on the
[SPEAKER_11]: flavor profile.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, so this is coming in consistently
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, we're, we're getting like all
balance levels, but of eight or nine of
[SPEAKER_04]: these, of these terpenes, which is again,
most laboratories have seen like what your
[SPEAKER_04]: samples were, the ones that you just
showed you had, you know, four that were
[SPEAKER_04]: really high level, maybe five,
but to get that many, like above seven or
[SPEAKER_04]: eight or nine, that that's something that
most laboratories we've talked to have
[SPEAKER_04]: never seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, again, you guys are
completely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each each strain and each cultivation
methodology is going to vary within the
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a cannabis cup level guy is going to
produce a much higher terpene level
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's an ability to understand
the correct macro micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you need the physics to actually
be able to have something conducive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant can generate this,
this type of biomass, this terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so if, if, if that's correct,
if you're a good cultivator, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know your shit and you,
you're putting in the right macro micros,
[SPEAKER_04]: the right nutrients, the right carbon
sources, their biology is going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: out in such a balanced expressions because
it's, it's, it's going to allow the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: to absorb exactly what it needs so that it
can reach again, what you guys say it's
[SPEAKER_04]: full genetic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and, and to, to compliment what
you're saying and what's skunk man and
[SPEAKER_10]: what, what Kamir is saying here is if
you're, if you're probiotic for the plant
[SPEAKER_10]: allows the plant to reach potential
expressions of what's genetically there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at this archive of
cultivar, you're, and you say,
[SPEAKER_10]: okay, the kosher Kush is in this classic
OG Kush gold where the Lyman equals the
[SPEAKER_10]: beta carotene equals the Mersene.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're able to, and you look at that
particular test, you show that's a kosher
[SPEAKER_10]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so what we were asking earlier,
which was, okay, let's apply your,
[SPEAKER_10]: your probiotic to a green candy or apply
it to a proprietary hybrid or these
[SPEAKER_10]: different, these different classifications
were like a Mersene classification.
[SPEAKER_10]: And see what that does to those levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the, it would be interesting if you
grow all of the same and you have these
[SPEAKER_10]: classifications he's showing us what the,
what the probiotic would effects would
[SPEAKER_10]: have on these terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if they all, if every single
classification of genetics that was grown
[SPEAKER_10]: by the same farmer and they all use this
probiotic and every single one of the
[SPEAKER_10]: classifications evened out, you would have
a phenomenal like weird something,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you would have something that's just
like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe so either.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think that would happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: What it would do is it's almost like a
probiotic enhancement.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're being able to like have the
plant reach its maximum terpene
[SPEAKER_10]: classification.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's what your probiotic
would do in each one of these
[SPEAKER_10]: classifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a grower right now in the central
coast who's actually just finished 18
[SPEAKER_04]: different strains that have been
cultivated with the, the soil balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're going to, you know,
maybe I can come back on here and show
[SPEAKER_04]: those to you guys once we have them in and
SC Labs is going to do the analysis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this classification chart though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to, this is, you know,
I showed you the close-up so that you
[SPEAKER_11]: could see the actual terpene breakdown,
but this is actually the really cool thing
[SPEAKER_11]: about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it relates to how the, you know,
what we were talking about with the
[SPEAKER_11]: Emerald Cup, the county fair and,
and creating terpene classes and then
[SPEAKER_11]: competing within the class.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you look at the purple subclass,
right, it's the Myrcine cariophylline and
[SPEAKER_11]: then Pinene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, look here, all these different
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the, this is not the purple Kush
that we have in Canada, but it was a
[SPEAKER_11]: sample in California called purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: The purple Urkel, the purple Voodoo,
the GDP, the right, the granddaddy perps
[SPEAKER_11]: and the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_11]: They all have the same, more or less
terpene profile, at least with regard to
[SPEAKER_11]: these major 17 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is how it fits into what we
were talking about, you know, like the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the dog, the dog, what are they,
dog breeding competition, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, that's what they were doing
with, with lining up the terpene classes
[SPEAKER_11]: is that you allow the plants with the
similar flavors to compete.
[SPEAKER_11]: For the same set of awards, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so those are different, for example,
from the silver subclass, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubba Kush master, cherry slider,
cherry coffin, the legend OG, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: They all have limonene is greater than
cariophylline and then roughly the same as
[SPEAKER_11]: Myrcine, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So on that white widow one, I don't know
the white widow I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't classify it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's classified as a purple, but it's
classified there because not of its look,
[SPEAKER_10]: but more of its terpene profiles,
what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's classified only by its terpene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Classification system.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though the flowers look different,
the chemical profiles are roughly the
[SPEAKER_11]: same.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's, there's minor variations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's only based on the top 17 most
predominant and most occurring terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your, your minor turps, like, you know,
alphabosobolol and guaiol and all these
[SPEAKER_11]: things, they can drastically change the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say that was, I thought
there might be a correlation there,
[SPEAKER_10]: but there's, I mean, for the majority of
what you have, there's a correlation of
[SPEAKER_10]: Myrcine being higher.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what your chart shows in
that particular category.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Myrcine is the dominant one in
each one of those, which would wonder if
[SPEAKER_10]: that has a, a certain reaction when
there's a, the phosphorus that's kind of a
[SPEAKER_10]: slowing and I guess quote unquote
bruising.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the plant creating the purple genetic
look, I thought that maybe Myrcine tied to
[SPEAKER_10]: it, but then the white widow doesn't
really grow purple at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it didn't, that's all.
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of those all have purple in them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the purple Kush is that's also another
very, there could be one called the
[SPEAKER_10]: perfect plan or AKA the dirty perps like
Oregon dirty perps.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where that purple Kush is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's all purple and Ken's GDP
is purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: The purple Voodoo is all purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue dream has some, uh, purple and blue
in, you know, hints of blue, a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: purple in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought maybe there was correlation
between the terpene and the, uh,
[SPEAKER_11]: no, cause they're independent traits and
you're getting morphology in that
[SPEAKER_11]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all based on chemistry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing that is interesting in that
class, Tony is that, um, I mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: GDP and the Urkels and the, you know,
they're all, they're really popular.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least they were for a few years in the
Bay area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what other plant was also hugely
popular in the Bay area was blue.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I had wondered if that was like a
regional preference for a chemical flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you look at the Bay area,
you need to be like a little sedated and
[SPEAKER_10]: hypnotic and like, I mean, there's a lot
going on over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is ground zero for a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe just those particular varieties
just made everyone chill out, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be, but it's, but I mean,
like, you know, like in Spain,
[SPEAKER_11]: for example, it's critical, you know,
critical plus or critical
[SPEAKER_11]: some of Shanti's hybrids are really
popular there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then if you go to Austria,
it's, it's the chronic, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like west coast to BC, west coast BC,
it's like PK, the purple Kush,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least it was for a few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we, we do develop these, like,
it's like, it's like a local, I call it a
[SPEAKER_11]: flavor preference, but it's like a local
fashion, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That develops in an area that people like.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pull out on that chart real quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that's also like kind of,
I mean, maybe it's a, maybe it's a dialect
[SPEAKER_08]: if T if terpenes are the, are the
language, like Peter was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I believe it's a silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that chart available online yet?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it is now that we've got it on the
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I meant was that Ethan sent me a
copy, but I was wondering, if somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: could point to an internet site where they
could grab it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the hash church group.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like probably in the next 25 minutes,
this will be recreated in a spreadsheet,
[SPEAKER_10]: all color coordinated on someone else's
deck, someone else's deck.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it also recreated it, put it out there
and it'll be on Tuesday or Wednesday's
[SPEAKER_10]: publication and then they'll claim it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's, I mean, it's published here
and it was published at the ICRS.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, Mark, Dr. Lewis from,
uh, from Napro gave me permission to put
[SPEAKER_11]: this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is super cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is their, you know, this is their
work when we, you know, this, they were
[SPEAKER_11]: the first to do the terpene
classification.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out, shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, I have to show you something on my
wall.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you print out the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got it right up on the wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: I development.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty big, uh, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You printed it out in full.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you go down to the store or you go
down to the printer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's mute.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's muted right now for some reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably talking and doesn't realize
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He already trademarked it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me go into the next piece of the
story then.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they've done is knowing that you
can have terpene profiles that are,
[SPEAKER_11]: that are replicatable and you know,
things fit into the same flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: That meant that there is a genetic
component to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they started breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and it's unfortunate, it's not easy to
tell on this variety, but on this poster,
[SPEAKER_11]: can you guys see in this poster?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can see like limonene super class
and you know, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_08]: we could see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you said, have we ever seen it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see like the, the accurate
graphs of which each one is doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have to zoom in a little bit more on
those ones, but let me zoom in on the
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene super class here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So essentially what you have, if you look
at the terpene fingerprints on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: One, two, three, they're pretty much the
same, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are small variations, but they are
pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the interesting thing is if you look
at the Canada dial, which is the ratio
[SPEAKER_11]: between the top two terpenes, this one
here on the left is a type one plant is
[SPEAKER_11]: THC dominant with a little bit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're different types.
[SPEAKER_11]: The middle one has is a type two plant
with the combination of both THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the right, this is another
hybrid that has majority of the,
[SPEAKER_11]: of the cannabinoids are, are CBD with a
little bit of THC profile, the terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: profile with varying cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now we're in a situation where you
can take these three varieties and you can
[SPEAKER_11]: start using them for clinical trials
because what you've done is you've
[SPEAKER_11]: stabilized the terpene compliment,
but you're varying the cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_11]: between treatment groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we get those?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you'd have to talk to Dr. Lewis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, and again, same thing in the
pining superclass, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Now these are both super cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're, they're knocking them
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pining superclass, limonene superclass.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one here, the beta cariothin
superclass is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_11]: The top, the first two, the left one is
again, type one pre THC predominant with a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Type two is a mixture of, of CBD and THC,
but this one here on the right is a really
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, it's, you can see the colors are
a little bit different on the Canada dial.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's because the top two,
the top two cannabinoids in this variety,
[SPEAKER_11]: are CBD and CBDV.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so CBD and CBDV are cannabinoids that
are, um, really effective for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where GW is chasing them down for
different kinds of epilepsy as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like CBD acts differently than CBDV.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I thought, I thought I saw Ethan
Russo talking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: About it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the, the CBDV is for a frontal
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He spoke about it recently when he was
here in Vancouver, you can, we can catch
[SPEAKER_08]: up on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would let Ethan be your guide on
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's saying it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this guy, but what you're saying is
somebody specifically bred these.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me finish.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's CBDV and CBD, but if you look at the
terpene cup background, it's high in beta
[SPEAKER_11]: cariophylline and high in linalool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And both of those terpenes are also anti
convulsant and anti spasmodic.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what it is is they take the
cannabinoids that are designed for a
[SPEAKER_11]: specific condition, in this case epilepsy,
and they put it in the terpene background
[SPEAKER_11]: that also has an entourage that has the
same effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is really a case where it was a
cultivar that was designed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, a lot of people that they look
at, we only need to figure out what
[SPEAKER_11]: strains work for which conditions where
this was a totally opposite approach.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was, let's create a variety that is
targeting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And who bred that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's doing this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is work that was done with
Napro through one of their clients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's killer, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's like the coolest shit I've
seen in a long time, to be honest with
[SPEAKER_10]: you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I wanted to lay out the whole
story for you guys from analytical method
[SPEAKER_11]: all the way through.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we need to get that into farmers to
grow it so we can extract it and get it
[SPEAKER_10]: into medicine to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So no, first we need to set up a call with
Dr. What was his name?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Lewis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Lewis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it into the farmers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to get these varieties out there
with the a trillion probiotic formula,
[SPEAKER_10]: step up the growing game, get this stuff
out in the masses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: A trillion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, the amount of work that went
into these plants and these this method,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these, you're not going to find
these clones on the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got to contract it though.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they'll be, yeah, they will find
people, you know, people that are serious
[SPEAKER_11]: partners will be licensed the technology
and all that kind of shit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, this is good progress.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are doing good work.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like, just because you
don't know about it necessarily doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: mean it's not happening out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every once in a while you get wowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: A wow moment from Chimera and the good
people at Napro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to, got to give credit to the Napro
folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: We give all credit to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, but you came and shared it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I give you a little bit of credit too.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: The, uh, I had a question, uh,
for you guys, cause that kind of was,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, something I was going to bring up
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: What, and scale down will probably be all
over this one to answer it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, we did some, we did some tests,
um, on converting THDA to THC and,
[SPEAKER_10]: or to CBN and figured out some different,
different methods of how to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, there was something while we were
doing, doing this process, we were,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, like in the Jack Frost's example,
when we used Jack Frost terpenes with Jack
[SPEAKER_10]: Frost flower oil and, um, and had it from
a originally tested, which would be
[SPEAKER_10]: probably, I'd say under 3% active,
um, applying no heat to it, but just
[SPEAKER_10]: actually soaking it in its own terpenes,
um, at a, uh, say 20 or 30% range.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we found over a course of time
organically with no heat that it actually
[SPEAKER_10]: converted, um, 60, 70% of the THC over to
THC when I tested it later.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your thoughts on the way that other
terpenes can play in- What did you
[SPEAKER_01]: convert?
[SPEAKER_10]: So converting the THCA to THC,
basically just activating it without any
[SPEAKER_10]: heat, but rather an organic, uh,
just using terpenes, just a saturation of
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and you, and you think that that sped
up the decarboxylation rate of THCA?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, just what you thought the potential
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of
things that can catalyze that heat is one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but also light and, uh,
air and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that if it was in a
solid form and if it's crystalline,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one thing because you have the low
energy form of the crystalline lattice to
[SPEAKER_01]: break up, to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you do make a solution,
can you increase its degradation rate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take to do that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so this was like just what we were,
just what we were calling our,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, like, you know, when you were creating
a high terpene rosin, um, this was over a
[SPEAKER_10]: period of I'd say, not that long,
maybe a couple of months, two,
[SPEAKER_10]: three months.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we tested it once and then we tested
it again.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I noticed by the third time I was
like, wow, there's a 50% conversion here
[SPEAKER_10]: and it didn't change the container or
exposure to light or change temperature.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually kept, uh, like 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is exposed to light or is it kept in the
dark?
[SPEAKER_10]: No light, no light.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are HPLC results, obviously,
because you're measuring acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We go through, uh, SC labs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have like a bulk account.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're always testing like everybody's
stuff that comes to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: For pesticides, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a small amount of the original
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know that that first data point is
actually valid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just curious what you thought about
it or what people thought because it
[SPEAKER_10]: appears it would make sense kind of on
this topic of conversation where people
[SPEAKER_10]: are breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that there's people breeding like
varieties out there for specific terpene
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles with specific ratios of those
particular cannabinoids, what the chemical
[SPEAKER_10]: or what that, what that then would lead
down into an extraction process.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that person has now a CBD CBV with a
certain terpene expression, and perhaps we
[SPEAKER_10]: can create an organic chemical reaction
with utilizing the terpenes themselves as
[SPEAKER_10]: a catalyst instead of heat or light,
because we came up with something else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I can convert.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have figured out a way, not with
terpenes, but a different way,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, to convert, um, our hash rosin or
flower rosin to CBN without losing any
[SPEAKER_10]: volume of weight, but rather convert.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah, I thought your eyebrows would go
up on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I start with a thousand grams of 70%
of flower rosin or hash rosin or an 80%
[SPEAKER_10]: distillate, um, I can convert that to CBN
without any, uh, without any of your
[SPEAKER_10]: traditional lighter heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, in another way that we developed,
uh, without any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will convert that thousand,
uh, grams to, uh, well, some other things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's not that it's, it's,
uh, it's, uh, not really my tech to share,
[SPEAKER_10]: but some other scientists that I worked on
with it for a while, they came up with it
[SPEAKER_10]: and obviously had me sign some paperwork,
but I was looking for it for our P four
[SPEAKER_10]: because I wanted to upscale it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause we had originally, I talked about it
before and released that in Toronto,
[SPEAKER_10]: how we sift and then we use heat and
oxygen to break the sift down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have like 250 milligrams of THC a
converts to about 70 milligrams of CBN.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a really long, tedious,
uh, laborious process.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really like kind of a degraded
nasty blood looking, um, oil at the end,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's just people are individuals.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do you scale it up was converting
converting this without losing weight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we could take like a 70 or 80% THC
a rosin or hash rosin or flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or distillate if you will, even if it's
THC, convert that to CBN without losing
[SPEAKER_10]: any weight at a 50%.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I'm 70% flower rosin, when I'm done,
I'm 350 milligrams of CBN with under the
[SPEAKER_10]: 0.1 THC without losing any volume of the
weight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, in that process, I started
thinking about how terpenes could be
[SPEAKER_10]: catalyst for converting THC by just having
just these random little experiments going
[SPEAKER_10]: along the side.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't know what you thought about
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought maybe I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no nothing compelling in most
cannabis terpenes to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they would, why wouldn't they just
decarboxylate on the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They coexist on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now what you're saying is you're
somehow extracting them and combining them
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing some kind of, you know,
most of that would be catalytic as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just lowering the activation energy to
decarboxylation happens at room
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens quicker at elevated temperature
and everywhere in between it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the amount of decarboxylation
has to do with, you know, either thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: history typically it's seen, but I can't
think of anything off top of my head why
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be promoting decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the, um, dehydrogenation event is
interesting to, to, um, to CBN,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you say that you have a method to
convert THC to CBN, which is always,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I mean, it's, so Arno's,
um, PhD dissertation, you could do that
[SPEAKER_01]: stoichiometrically using selenium based
oxidation or sulfur or sulfoxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, is that, yeah, um,
when it's oxidized, all that those
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and all of those other fragile
thermally sensitive molecules are,
[SPEAKER_01]: are just going to create just polar
degradated colored compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all the crap because as Sam
will attest to CBN is a white colorless
[SPEAKER_01]: solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's, uh, has any color to
it at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, yeah, that's one thing I was
going to say that this is opaque gray,
[SPEAKER_10]: the CBN that we're getting in the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I'm done with it, you should try
recrystallizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's recrystallized from,
uh, methanol, I think is usually where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's recrystallized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I was going to say that on the
crystallization of CBN to get it into
[SPEAKER_10]: crystallization and like terpenes being
non-polar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, everything I'm trying to do is
without chemicals, but that's what the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientists I mean, other people would say,
yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could recrystallize the material to
purity and then you can analyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you only find one compound that
it's CBN, then you know that all this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: that you purified away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a solid coming out of that,
it probably is CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to purify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can flash it down a little
chromatography column or do whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do to hang up any of the color
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think, and I think Sam has
actually shown a sample here on Crash
[SPEAKER_01]: Church, white crystalline solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like white as, as THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's a white crystalline
solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, could you say, suspend the,
uh, the, uh, oil and ethanol and bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: pure oxygen through it to convert it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would, I would just not use oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just use air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't like heating up,
um, oxygen because oxygen, if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: things that'll do hydroxidation,
yeah, it could be really, uh, really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really all you need is air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, there's different ways you can
accelerate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add basically, I, I'm not going to
give away anyone's IP and I probably
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, is that look in the
literature, there are methods for the
[SPEAKER_01]: stoichiometric conversion of THC to CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just musing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking oxygen and I wouldn't,
uh, yeah, oxygen, oxygen under pressure
[SPEAKER_10]: with any kind of, yeah, it's, it could be
explosive pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about bubbling some through a
solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I try, I tried taking, uh,
once upon a time we tried taking like a
[SPEAKER_10]: pump, just air through regulators,
through oil, tried to heat it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to take rosin in the past and
torch it at like 500, 600, 800 degrees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, none of that, uh, seemed to do the
trick.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, it's definitely, um, something
that I was interested in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these two other guys have discovered
that they're very techie scientists
[SPEAKER_10]: people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I think you guys might,
you know, it's through their company.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I think you guys might like
have a patentable thing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, they're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know anyone else doing
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I've seen a lot of the different
stuff and I just put an idea in their
[SPEAKER_10]: head.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, you know, I try to, you know,
trying to figure out things without
[SPEAKER_10]: chemicals, but yeah, at the end,
the polarity plays a big difference
[SPEAKER_10]: because THCA and it's a polarity on like a
hexane or a hydrocarbon, um, the non-polar
[SPEAKER_10]: effect, um, allows it to crystallize very
easily.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you get to CBN, um, polarity
plays a big part in how you would
[SPEAKER_10]: crystallize that, uh, at least naturally.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the only viable solution was probably a
chemical, like you're saying, just to,
[SPEAKER_10]: just to get it done, just to say,
okay, here it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's test it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Hey, I got a quick point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing I wanted to bring up from
the ICER actually just kind of on topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's something that Dr. Sheldon has
been saying for a long time, but these
[SPEAKER_11]: guys who actually went through and heard
the, the researcher's name was Morgan.
[SPEAKER_11]: Melissa Lewis, unrelated to Mark,
and she's working in Toronto with one of
[SPEAKER_11]: the universities there or a few of the
universities there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And anyway, they did a bunch of extracts
using a supercritical and ethanol and a
[SPEAKER_11]: bunch of different extract types.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they ran the extracts through an
MS, a GCMS device.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, they noted that there was a whole
bunch of chemistry that actually had gone
[SPEAKER_11]: on in the, in the process.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they showed that some compounds were
created and some compounds were removed
[SPEAKER_11]: from the, um, from matrix just,
just by the process of doing the
[SPEAKER_11]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, again, what Mark has been
saying for, for months and months and
[SPEAKER_11]: months now, probably longer when you're
doing these extractions, there's chemistry
[SPEAKER_11]: that's going on and it's not, you're not
just pulling it, pulling out what is in
[SPEAKER_11]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about optimizing the process so
that you're capturing what's in the
[SPEAKER_11]: flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, otherwise you are doing
chemistry and you're changing it into
[SPEAKER_11]: something else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, I asked her if I could take a
photo of her data to share it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said, no, because they're going to
be publishing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be publishing it
sometime, hopefully in the next six
[SPEAKER_11]: months.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, we'll be able to go it over,
go over things a little more in depth at
[SPEAKER_11]: that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did she see the formation of ashy sheen at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that like a degradation product that
she found in her, in her work?
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was some really interesting
things that I'll tell you offline.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's something we could look at when
I, I'm going to do this experiment again
[SPEAKER_10]: for you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, and for everyone that's listening
and see if there is a, now that I'm going
[SPEAKER_10]: to do it specifically with Jack Frost
again, I'll start with a flower or a
[SPEAKER_10]: rosin, get it tested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'll have the terpenes tested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'll combine the two.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'll monitor it over one month to six
months, get the degradation, see the
[SPEAKER_10]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And see if it, uh, see if that happens,
you know, we'll do it with hash root too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you're using lab that has GCMS
because most people are using FID and they
[SPEAKER_11]: don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does SC labs use?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that's what we've been using.
[SPEAKER_11]: They use GCF ID.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're, they run like an algorithm
essentially has computers pull out the
[SPEAKER_11]: known peaks, but hash machine is not going
to be a turf that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who could I send that to?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they might have MS.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure, but I believe they probably
will.
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably do have a GCMS, but you're
going to have to go in and say,
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I don't want your standard turf test.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to look for the presence of
hash machine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they're, they're, they're
typical turf tests, they run on GCF ID.
[SPEAKER_11]: You won't pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't actually the, the,
the mechanism that was implicated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: authors in that paper was a photolytic
mechanism where you got a recombination of
[SPEAKER_01]: the di radical that's form form when a
mirror scene is, is irradiated with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, again, some of these things
happen thermally as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: photolytically, but that particular one,
it would be interesting to do that on a
[SPEAKER_01]: mirror scene enriched variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this data shows to take someone that
has a lot of mirror scene, those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation components in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just one, there are several
thermal pathways that terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, especially with the mercy and skeleton
will either rearrange to give the terpene,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpening, uh, sabotage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a whole family of them and
they're just isomeric and where the double
[SPEAKER_01]: bonds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those things are formed
thermally, they're usually formed a
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture of like four or five compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one compound turns to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four or five, like instantly just because
of these thermal degradation routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, thanks for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the original paper,
what the conversion rate was from their
[SPEAKER_00]: scene to that machine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, but they, they measured it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd have to pull it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all they did was tested it after
the fact and not before maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but why I thought in that paper,
they actually intentionally did it on
[SPEAKER_01]: mercy and itself to look for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I think found literature
precedent for this reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hadn't been observed, I guess on hash,
but, and I guess the, the point maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to raise him is that this is
thought of as sort of like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the thermodynamic dead end of hash that's
been shined the light on for a long period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time because ultimately maybe it's just
been pressed with heat and it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit old and it's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the conversion was done in plant,
but maybe it was done when it was on the
[SPEAKER_11]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my doubts, but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we don't, I mean, it was because
the tests were done by French police on
[SPEAKER_11]: C's sample.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have no idea where in the,
in the chain of custody that conversion
[SPEAKER_11]: happened.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I could do all those little
experiments.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we could run wash it to sit variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, we could take,
uh, I mean, we could, there's access to
[SPEAKER_10]: blue dream, which is honestly very,
very, very high in, uh, mercy.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'd look for Tony is look for AF GUI
AF GUI is like, I've got tons of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you see the phenotype that's almost
exclusively mirror scene, there's one out
[SPEAKER_11]: there that might be a good one to look at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's absolutely prevalent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's usually from the guys that I
get, um, that one's a 25% plus THC too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's got homework.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he ever drop out fast after saying
that that was like, I should end church
[SPEAKER_08]: one day like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're also like, uh, Mark, we created
in this same type of process, rosin
[SPEAKER_10]: distillate again, without winterizing with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's back.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but yeah, we were creating these
different, uh, I was just trying to create
[SPEAKER_10]: different products because we've got
bubble man and I got some other projects
[SPEAKER_10]: in the horizon, but, uh, it was,
how do we create like, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: a distillate out of rosin without
winterizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in that same process, it was like,
all right, well we can do that,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we could also do a, um, uh,
conversion in the CBN.
[SPEAKER_10]: So next week I should have some hopefully,
and I'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you tell me what, what was the
chemical you wanted to use?
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoked our CBN.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but that was a using heat and
segregated.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, this won't use any, uh,
yeah, but we have it in pill form and
[SPEAKER_10]: sublingual form CBD and CBN for like four
years now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was all from, but it's a different
process.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it to discover 64 and Fort Collins
and we'll run an NMR and HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nth degree of everything that you have
in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the, uh, what was the chemical you
were saying to use to crystallize that and
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would say a good place to start
would be maybe methanol or ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, just try to make a
saturated solution material, boil it up so
[SPEAKER_01]: it dissolves and then just, you know,
look to see if you can crystallize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would grow a piece of rock candy,
you know, it is, is a polar molecule.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That one would work.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, methanol, methanol is toxic.
[SPEAKER_10]: You may want to, what about purified like
95% ethanol, like a, uh, organic,
[SPEAKER_10]: what about an organic ethanol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from grant, like, uh, it doesn't make
a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you're just trying to crystallize.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got something for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an organic one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what to use for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: We shall see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the, the other thing I wanted to
get back to what Peter was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is that, um, you know,
you were talking about sense and like
[SPEAKER_01]: human sense of a big part of the human,
uh, effluent is actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's lactic acids, a lot of lactic acid
that's actually, um, given off by people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's has to do with just all kinds
of biochemical processes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that's one of the things
that mosquitoes hone in on a goal marker
[SPEAKER_01]: that mosquitoes actually use to identify a
blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's thought of that deep and other
insect repellents somehow interfere with
[SPEAKER_01]: the insects ability to detect lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have a particular sensor way of
doing that sort of chemo specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that some humans, have more lactic
acid and are more attractive to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to mosquitoes and other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like my wife will get bit before I
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like her system, like she's like more of a
mosquito target than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's like that with other
different people, but, um, lactic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it is a bio marker for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot to do with the biological,
you know, biome that actually lives on
[SPEAKER_01]: your skin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you muted?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was muted.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually Peter isn't muted,
but I can't hear him now.
That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you might have to talk about
mosquitoes and the fact that my wife
[SPEAKER_00]: always got bit before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after she had a serious illness
and took huge amounts of medication,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't bite her anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead they would bite me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly it has a lot to do with live on
your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's quite a bit of bacteria
that live on people's skin naturally.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've almost rocked three and a half
hours so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtags today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, people were wondering if you were
standing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like to stand up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I feel like if I'm sedentary,
if I'm just, you know, sitting,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, my body just starts to, you know,
I like to be up and I channel better that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three plus hours of standing this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm probably now going to go do,
um, despicable me with the little guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you, will you stand in the theater as
well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be the guy in the back standing up in
a weird corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I really enjoyed, um,
I can't thank you enough, man,
[SPEAKER_04]: for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you guys, I really thank you for,
for having me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a, it's been beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll continue the conversation for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one more question for Peter and
that is, do you manufacture your own
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms or do you purchase them and
mix them or what is it that your company
[SPEAKER_00]: actually does?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually, um, around the world,
I mean, multiple countries, multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, and we actually isolated
each individual string.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we, we studied and tried to find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do manufacture them ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of nice because,
you know, if you, if you think about
[SPEAKER_04]: certain things or certain products,
there can be such a diversity of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of strains and you don't really know what
exactly is going in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, biology is so diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've done is we have 62 strains
at the exact same amounts every single
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we take great pride in the fact
that our product is consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and for what you guys are talking
about and how that relates, it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be so nice to actually
quantify the, um, the different strains
[SPEAKER_04]: and what they're able to produce,
uh, you know, those, those, those
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes, um, in combination with,
with these, uh, microbial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there could be a better effect if you
use more, we could see a better effect if
[SPEAKER_04]: we use less of certain types of terpene,
uh, strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, that's, I guess the best way
to answer the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, uh, the product is consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we recreate them ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we don't create them ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're part of mother nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just found them and we recreate
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grow them at high numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bioprospecting bio, you're a
bioprospector, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bio mining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for opening my eyes to some of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered some and, uh, very interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you coming and giving all
this information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for purchasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're very grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Peter, we're going to give it a run
here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like a great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's what we're really hoping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I'd love to give you guys
some products so you can test it out and
[SPEAKER_04]: see what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited for you to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's one thing to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing to come in here,
but for you to see it and to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: smell it and the colors and the trichome
production is just going to exceed your
[SPEAKER_04]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that and I'm projecting that energy
out there because I know it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's happened right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a 92% repurchase rate on this
product after trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people that are actually putting it
in the ground, um, are rebuying 92% of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any business that's been our biggest
challenge, uh, to be honest is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, having these growers just to use
it, you know, humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we have a gentleman up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Ty, uh, Ty Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know him up in
Humboldt, you know, Ty Tony.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard of him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I might've met him before too.
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd probably be upset if I've met him
multiple times and said, I think,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's, that name sounds extremely
familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he's put it on his plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that the 10 grows unit said
they've never seen anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it before the, the, the, the,
the plant leaves just started kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were really, you know,
elevated with, with a different kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so once he saw that, he contacted me
and said, I'd like to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: get this out in the Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's, it's spreading like wildfire
just, just through custom use.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you tried, uh, you probably already
working on it, but have you tried a,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, any type of foliar?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can, you know, not, not on say the
buds, but I would say as a veg product,
[SPEAKER_10]: but if it's all natural and people don't
have to use a pesticide, you know what I
[SPEAKER_10]: mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never said that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you don't have to use pesticides on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's people's choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just their growing methods.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about controlling environment and
keeping a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plant will push off the pest,
the bugs if they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they're what you're saying,
like if you're using a probiotic in the
[SPEAKER_10]: soil and the plant does what it says it's
supposed to, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_10]: then it should naturally ward off those,
those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was just curious if you guys had
developed anything in that same realm,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's a foliar that would also help as a
beneficial that doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: people use tea compost and they spray all
kinds of stuff on their plants during veg
[SPEAKER_10]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we're hoping to get to a point
down the road where we can sell enough of
[SPEAKER_04]: this product and begin, you know,
with the quality to, to bring in more
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists to continually develop those
types of foliar applications that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: conducive to the colonization that happens
when the soil borne pathogens such as
[SPEAKER_04]: Pythium, Fusarium, Verticillium,
Rhizoctonia, Guyomanomyces, Botrytis,
[SPEAKER_04]: Pythium, all of those guys that you deal
with, especially the, the Paranospera,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the, the Pottery and Downy Mildews,
those are all incubating within your soil
[SPEAKER_04]: and they get to a point of competency
where they actually colonize the stem of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant and that's how you get your
disease topically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to, to elicit an immune response as
well as add the correct strains conducive
[SPEAKER_04]: to pathogen suppression on the,
the, the, the leaf biofilm is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that we will be getting into down the road
once, you know, we get to a, a place or a
[SPEAKER_04]: space where, where we can afford those
types of people and scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're kind of like a, in some ways
we're kind of like Tesla right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just starting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a, we have a, a regenerative
sustainable technology that can help the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment and we need the support of all
these people that are tuned into their
[SPEAKER_04]: plants to, to help us grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to grow with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all, we're all kind of in the same
boat right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are doing something that's
federally illegal, you know, and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing something right now that's off the
charts as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your website again?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can get it out there for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's soilbalancepro.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say that my license is
federal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what, what you guys are up
to, but we're all, we're all doing
[SPEAKER_04]: something that is, I really feel it's,
it's light work, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, it's coming from a place of giving
and it's coming from, and so it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from inside all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's coming from the stem of human
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful thing to be a part of
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at, I was just talking about this
with a friend of mine the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look in the dark ages, you know,
where people were so inundated with
[SPEAKER_04]: shadow, you know, pain and suffering,
killing each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and we've come through such a nice
point of evolution to now where we're
[SPEAKER_04]: actually able to, to have abundance and be
able to hopefully elevate to a really high
[SPEAKER_04]: level of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of that is going to be tuning
back into nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like every, every grower feels as
they tune into their plant, they,
[SPEAKER_04]: they, they resonate, they understand that
part of our responsibility, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: as organisms on this planet, as human
beings is to take care of the predominant
[SPEAKER_04]: species on this planet, which is our
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we tune into them, they'll tune
back into us, they'll give us our food,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll give us our medicine, you know,
they'll, they'll, they'll heal this whole
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, man, with, with what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and that's why I named the
product Soil Balance because the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the time for balance is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is a response.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, no, nothing happens
without a response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think probably before we started
wearing shoes, athlete's foot wasn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, you know, so our bodies responded
by allowing a fungi to grow in them
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're wearing shoes, which isn't
really the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's become the norm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so yeah, if you guys have any
questions about the biology, how the mode
[SPEAKER_04]: of action works, I'd love to go into that
a little bit, if you have any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start going to a restaurant without
any shoes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You call it an Italian restaurant,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy Bravo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will probably do a little Soil Balance
Wake and Bake giveaway in the near future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can picture it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good old Wake and Bake.
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave away Dana's book yesterday,
Green Buds and Hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember good old Green Buds and Hash,
everybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: Great book.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, I read it on my Wake and
Bake the other day and it's surprisingly
[SPEAKER_08]: educational.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say he did a great job on that
parody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Dana Larson for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, did I miss a question right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear, I think I didn't hear
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, just answer it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I heard something about shoes right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, if you thought you heard a
question, just answer it regardless and
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you do, take care of your shoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's how I sign all my emails from
my cell phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you don't wear shoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you ever wear is flip-flops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't live in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because you are uninitiated,
my grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, Sam's talking about the Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think he's on the Illuminati one
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I want to join.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm probably going to get to
Despicable Me because it's about 1230,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I really enjoyed my space here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and all your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so grateful to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thanks for coming out, Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be in touch off camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to call it a show as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been such a great show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless Chimera, Sam, Mark Chaldone,
Tony, if you guys had anything else to
[SPEAKER_08]: say, Indra, by all means, we can continue
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to cut anyone off,
but if you guys... Maybe end it with a
[SPEAKER_10]: little Mark Jem and he's got a little
guitar in his hand, I see.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say happy Canada Day
belated to everybody in Canada yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the Sesquicentennial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Happy Fourth of July coming up for
America.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Fourth of July to all our American
friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, 150 years, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to cut you off, Chimera.
[SPEAKER_08]: A great what?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just have a great celebration.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be safe out there and have fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puff much melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puff much melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fourth of July.
[SPEAKER_08]: And enjoy Despicable Me 3 with your child,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it will be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes me want to go do that today,
except I'm going out on the boat with my
[SPEAKER_08]: non-friends from Whistler and I'm going to
pull them on the wakeboard and the
[SPEAKER_08]: wakeskate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I may go live later on for a little bit
of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the meantime, Chimera, thanks for
the knowledge drop and the sharing of all
[SPEAKER_08]: that great information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skunkman Sam, as always.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Indra, thank you guys for making it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Chaldone, Dr. Mark and Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: From Soil Balance Pro, Tony Versura in the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for our fellows, Darren Massey and
Johnny Berfalo, thanks for coming in
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those that didn't make it today,
Todd McCormick and Etienne Fontaine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we missed you guys, but I'm sure
we'll see you sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching Hash Church,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's convenient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we still live?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mine says live.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you didn't end it before.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should all just hang up and I'll meet
you at the other spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent you both an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adios.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ciao, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
