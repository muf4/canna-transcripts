[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, I made it back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an absolutely incredible trip Jamaica
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even tell you how great it was
from just landing at the airport,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting picked up by good friends,
clearing customs really easily,
[SPEAKER_00]: blazing right to my buddy's house in
Spanish town and whipping off a batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I, you've already seen the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a couple of days later we ended
up in a 400 pound plus field growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Westmoreland, which is a very famous area
of the West in Jamaica, Negro,
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Hill, Grange Hill, Bluefield,
Sheffields.
[SPEAKER_00]: These areas are all in Westmoreland and
they grow some of the finest ganja on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island, go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard about it in many of
Reggae songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm finally back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back out to Jamaica in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot more things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's kind of, you know,
not quite on the let's tell everyone yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's just say we're working on some
interesting projects down in Jamaica and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do some pretty fun things
down there with some really good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticed the Frank 151 book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already given them a little shout
out, but shout out again to Frank 151 for
[SPEAKER_00]: the really excellent placement on my
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a front and back page cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were grown by Remo the urban grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the UBC chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just got stories on
basically a ton of my friends in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, it's a good little book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their 420 edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out at frank151.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Slinger's got a little article
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a cold water hash from full Flava.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my little article right there,
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thank you for, thanks for
the pillow guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fucking sickest thing I've seen
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had my trichome photography put on
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a big veloury comfy pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about laying your head down on
some trichomes, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's exciting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's an exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my second last day in Jamaica,
my friend Jeff, thank you Bretta for
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking this up by the way, invited us all
down to Innity Yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Innity Yard is a really cool spot
owned by this woman, Andrea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super really kind, awesome lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave us a CD of one of the new artists
she's promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman has an incredible history and
you'll be able to hear about that more
[SPEAKER_00]: when BBC's finish their interview with her
and they're able to put that online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do the links into this video in fact
when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at Innity Yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible reggae music's playing on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really nice stuff and I find some
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of different guys give me bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a really cool Japanese guy there
that was pretty heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a little bit of bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had that classic ammonia smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit too strong for my likings but
my friend Jeff pulled out a bud and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the most perfect bud I've seen
since I've been there actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really beautiful, looked like Orange Hill,
the Orange Hill kill as I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I managed to pull out a single
seed from this bud and I just thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was hilarious because 20 years ago I
brought the seeds back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought only eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cracked them and only one popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured, I only found one seed in
this bud and here it is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start the, we'll start it off right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening here is I'm gonna do
my paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Jamaica seed's gonna crack in the
blink of an eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it almost looks like it's ready
to crack already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this into the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna grab a little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we got the spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there's a million ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really need to hear about your
comments on how this isn't the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the seed will crack,
it will sprout and it will grow me a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that doesn't count as working and
real, then I don't know what does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the way I've done it since I
was a young lad teenager when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always just moistened paper towel up.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to give the inside a little
spooch and boing, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys saw it here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this gonna be?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know, but it's gonna be something
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just cover that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I normally do is I put another plate
over top of it and then I'll put it on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my receiver actually, which seems to be
always at this really nice ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will evaporate the water out if I left
it there for 48 hours, but I'll check it
[SPEAKER_00]: literally every 12 hours and give it a
little spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would suspect within the next,
you know, probably by tonight or tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, we'll see a root on this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start the process by macro
photographing the entire thing once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like I have with the original
Jamaica plant, you've got to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: original Jamaica plant actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me bring you outside for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here's the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Jamaican seed is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Jamaica, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is by far the tallest out of
all the plants I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other plant that's even close is
a sunflower plant over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got real nice nine levers
throughout, seven and nine levers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mutation in the center of the
stalk is absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Horel Philotaxi you can see here is
doing a one, a two, and a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got three growths here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one shot out three as well,
but then mutated and shot out a second
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in this split we may have lost
the Horel Philotaxi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks as though it's now growing as a
normal plant, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the Jamaican Lambsbred Hybrid
Cross that I planted on May 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell this plant is only a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taller than the Afghani,
the Congolese, the sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sweet skunk's closing in on it,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty exciting, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, six weeks of growth and the
thing is three and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a plant grow that fast on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already shot out many pistolet stigma
hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not worried about it turning into
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't mind maybe this one being a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: How nice would that be if I got a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this and I could smack that little
female?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also took a bunch of clones yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five Doc Atomic Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five Medi Kushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five hash plants, five sweet
skunks, five harmonies and five hosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Hayes OG Skunk Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is there to tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I came home to a beautiful bag of dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 99% by any means, but I'll be able to
clean it up to a 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just one bag to give you an idea of
the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's self-pressing into rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep this out of the heat so I can
clean it up and I'll probably do a small
[SPEAKER_00]: video on how to prepare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you guys have seen the
carding technique enough that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really too important for me to show that
over and over and over again, but I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to show you guys how to prepare resin
like this when you do get some nice dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pressed into these little rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're fairly tough and if I
let them heat up too much, they'll melt
[SPEAKER_00]: and self-press even worse, in which case
it'll be much harder to clean the heads
[SPEAKER_00]: out from the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do have a little bit of pure heads
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me just grab the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, so I got a little bit of
this dry sift here, a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start it off with the barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out of town for too long and
I've missed barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's so, so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, some of you may be wondering,
hey bubble man, why are you using a
[SPEAKER_00]: titanium nail in your D-nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am using it because I pooched my
whip in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I believe I actually pooched the
whip in Spain, but it was still working
[SPEAKER_00]: and it worked the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back from Spain for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit sketchy, but I just
kept using it instead of ordering a new
[SPEAKER_00]: one and then when I finally took the new
whip to Jamaica, it petered out halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: through the trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it was a little bit unfortunate not to
be able to hit the D-nail as often as I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have liked, but I'm back home and I
can hit it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've also got a couple of cool things
that they sent me from D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably be doing a video in the very
new future on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceramic disc, as you guys saw before
when we were hitting these off the melt
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they sent me a black one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've got the white and the black
ceramic, which will sit right on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: either my quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a new quartz bowl I actually got.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's just a slider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slides right into almost any pipe,
just a matter of getting the whip on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first trip back since I've been home
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came in late last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running quite a bit of chores
this morning with the garden I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bunch of clones last night at two
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out all my mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 15 mothers out on my deck
right now, about three to four feet tall
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got tent number one, which is in full
bloom and it actually comes down not that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have any specific time when it comes
down, but I would suggest that it should
[SPEAKER_00]: come down in the next 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'll be cutting those down and then
the LED and the HPS experiment that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in my second tent that we just built
recently, John and I, it's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been gone for 14 days and
they've started flowering right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: time that I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're two weeks into flower and
it'll be interesting to see how they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, the ones that are
blooming right now under the HPSs are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look really forward to seeing what this
LED can produce and I'll probably go down
[SPEAKER_00]: today and photograph the different bud
formations and the pistolet hairs on both
[SPEAKER_00]: the LED and the HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been doing that for the last
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I was in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't really say unfortunately,
but I would have loved to have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the side-by-side all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a couple weeks in, so we'll
still get a real nice idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on and in the end,
it's really all about that final resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess it's time to take a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: D-nails at 700, mothership in hand,
skillet tool and barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, the barb is loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt my temperature go up a solid 10
degrees.
Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: my last trip to Jamaica was very busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't just doing Bubble Man's World
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably why you noticed I only
really put up a few videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very busy while I was there having
different meetings and setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be definitely interested in
telling you guys about that in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future, but unfortunately, one of the
things I never really got to do this year
[SPEAKER_00]: in Jamaica was really find the best herb
that I could and turn it into some full
[SPEAKER_00]: melt hash like I did in 2001, 2002,
2003, 2004, 2005 and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next trip, when I go back in a couple
weeks, I'm going to organize making some
[SPEAKER_00]: really beautiful bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you'll see more macro
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see more shots of living resin as
well as extracted heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some melt videos as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys love the melt videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be blabbing on for much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to do a quick video letting
everyone know that I'm back in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back with my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back with my hash and ready to move
things forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye out on this Jamaican seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be posting that on my
Facebook page at freshheadies.bubbleman as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as bubbleman.freshheadies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two separate pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you'll see it on the Instagram
account, bcbubbleman.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, keep watching Bumbleman's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
