[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to say I'm with my good buddy
Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come over today for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passing of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sharing of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sharing of genetics, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to pass that over to me again
just like we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The east coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very well-known cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked to have acquired this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely, for any of you guys out
there who know the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a familiar funk, actually,
that Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Goosey Cullen's funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, Goosey Cullen is the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm really happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just super thanks for passing this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of course going to be shared with
many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's get to the Buck Marcel
Angler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always so stoked to be able to hit
this thing.
It's just ridiculous.
Yeah, this is always going to be one of
the highlights of my collection,
no matter what I take at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barb's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not a strain you see here in BC
that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, that's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I must.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your light hair?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always just such a pleasure to hit
the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Buck and shout out to Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really just a shout out to all glass
blowers pushing the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're the guy who's learning,
who has literally learned one technique
[SPEAKER_00]: from a friend, and you're just kind of
copying that technique over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That potential copying, that experience
will lead you to mistakes, will lead you
[SPEAKER_00]: to revelations, and will lead you
potentially to create something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit the nuts, or the Arians.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arians Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, I'm not sure what number this
was, but Arians number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in this row when we had all the
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's four or five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number three had a nevels cut in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the super silver Hayes,
which was worked on by Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it had another, some other
creature, a louse, a louse sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really quite a beautiful selection of
genetics to put into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then puffing the pure sift out of the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, bubble man style,
one hand in that thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like it's in a giant chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubbling and the percolating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that is a piece of glass.
One of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every time I come here,
Flavs, super easy going about his glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any piece I request, he'll pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rarely request pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he asked me, in my head,
I pictured this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looks at me and he says,
the buck angler, buck angler fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: His true art needs to be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be appreciated, it needs to be held
and hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one thing to sit on a shelf
all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's also one thing to have a
pipe like this and fill it with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing to fill it with full
amount of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just such great qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your little Barbara bud out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have faith in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I'm here to back you up if
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case I'm down in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always there for my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited about the sour D's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my Jamaican seed sprouted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just genetics all around in bubble
man's garden happening with Afghani and
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara bud, Congolese and sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Boy, My Little Pony, The Hoss,
Romulan Cross with the OG Number 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: MK Ultra, My Little Pony, Two Finos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Rockstar, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to congratulate him on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hit would have killed most elephants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Flav just took it until he exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's epoxy coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you may not notice in these
videos, we tend to get fairly cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we tend to medicate appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a better way of saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that stuff's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a shout out to the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got a good smock to it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really grabs you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different resonance,
the barb and the Aryan taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, full melt dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: An epic class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you soon on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
