[SPEAKER_00]: The day, and this gentleman here to my
right, right here, this guy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunglasses, this is the incredible bubble
man, and he responds to the water in my
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble man, I'll tell you, you're a
legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this is his effect, fresh hatties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the bubble now, he's got bubble
bag kids, this guy is the master of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not bubble boy, this is bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, let's have a warm hand for
the legend himself, bubble man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Tony from River Rock in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well thanks everybody for showing
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a bit of a chaotic cup with the
government pushing us out here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: and just trying to mess with us,
but I'm happy to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've been coming here for,
geez, years, like maybe 20 years or more
[SPEAKER_01]: for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to introduce Tony here who I've
got, they mentioned from River Rock,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's also from United Cannabis,
and I guess I was going to kind of start
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular talk about, a little bit
about what we've been doing, how Tony and
[SPEAKER_01]: I are connected with both obvious resin
aficionados.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been, well you've been making water
hash and growing herb and doing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things for the last 15 plus years,
I would say, Tony?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm starting in 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: 96, okay, so you're about 18 years in,
so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a similar amount of time,
I was 92, 93, started growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: got into cannabis activism in 93,
94, 95, and that's when we got,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were applying for hemp licenses in
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got hemp growing there legally for the
first time in 73 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been growing ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of my old partners,
Alex, might be in the room from Manitoba
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest and Fresh Hemp Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, got into the hash game in the
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess where we're coming from is,
recently we started a project,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard,
there's all sorts of different things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony himself is a part of a very big
project called United Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and United Cannabis has licenses all over
North America and in Canada and have
[SPEAKER_01]: applied for in Jamaica, which is really
what brought Tony and I together,
[SPEAKER_01]: working together, was a project that we
started in Jamaica, a company that I
[SPEAKER_01]: started with my Jamaican partners as well
as Johnny B., John Berfellow, who may also
[SPEAKER_01]: be in the room here somewhere,
I'm not sure if he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started this company in Jamaica and
we partnered up with United Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: who Tony is a big part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have Ernie Blackman from United
Cannabis and River Rock Wellness Center in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room today as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where exactly he is,
but he's here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this project is is, I'll let you
tell a little bit about United Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'll bring it into the Jamaican
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well I'm gonna bring it always back
to the resin because I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Robert Clark explained,
even up until a year ago, your eyes open
[SPEAKER_03]: when you start to explore the different
varieties of cannabis and its forms,
[SPEAKER_03]: which also represent the variety of resin
and the type of profile that you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: get from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people, I think, look at
bubble bags and they look at different
[SPEAKER_03]: screens and different things and think
that's gonna make it, that's the winning
[SPEAKER_03]: ticket, that's the magic of how to make
the resin or the medicine exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really it's a relationship with the
genetics, the resin, the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: the extraction process, and then
ultimately what are you doing with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as most societies and cultures,
they think of the pot leaf and they think
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis and they think of,
okay, that's for the stoner community,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't possibly have those people in our
town.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where it always starts
and now with hemp and medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pushing hard into states and
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the governments are slowly
starting to realize that, wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is maybe some medical benefits here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those avenues are now being pushed
open, but ultimately at the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: day, it's freeing the plant, freeing the
resin so that we can explore it in its
[SPEAKER_03]: full capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the social acceptance and
responsibility of cannabis to be used
[SPEAKER_03]: publicly should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: The medical avenues of cannabis should be
explored to its fullest with all science
[SPEAKER_03]: and research as well as the industrial
uses of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be restored farming back in the
United States and provide limitless jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the idea of what we were trying to
do with just the simple starting up of
[SPEAKER_03]: River Rock, which is a medical center and
also recreational center in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_03]: was finding a way to synergize the final
therapeutics of the plant and the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid profiles into standardized
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to figure out where to
start when you think about standardizing
[SPEAKER_03]: resin for medicinal purposes and what that
actually means.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can kind of explain that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, while Tony was doing this with River
Rock, Tony and Ernie, while they were
[SPEAKER_01]: mastering the growing aspect and the
business aspect of dealing with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different people, it's very difficult,
particularly when running a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have difficulty in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in trials and tribulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got health problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just dealing with them alone is a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while these guys were doing that work,
I, of course, have been spending the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years learning about isolating and
decontaminating resin glands of a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular variety of capitate stocked and
sessile stocks are the two that I prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: all this being a lower quality gland that
tends to make up a lot of the extra weight
[SPEAKER_01]: and oil extractions, but doesn't have as
much of an important factor, at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: the recreational and what I would call the
extreme medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, you have a serious
ailment, you're in stage three or four,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to need a serious
saturation of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids into your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that there's no medicinal value
in bulbous trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure once we get into that,
there's the actual studying of specific
[SPEAKER_01]: types of glands and learning where these
cannabinoids exist in the different glands
[SPEAKER_01]: that we'll be able to do specific work
breeding and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I came in as the sort of
decontaminate, you know, the quality that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've set has really led me into the team
that these guys are building, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: United Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a beautiful thing to see unity
in the cannabis industry and to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not about who you are or,
it's basically really all about what you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and what standard you can set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a breeder of exceptional
talent, or a grower with exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: talent, or a processor, then you're
probably going to find yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with a position in United
Cannabis one day because it really is this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly large growing company that has
a really incredible root, foundation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is to produce the utmost quality of
medicine, to extract and process to the
[SPEAKER_01]: purest form, and to give access to all of
the different people who have a necessity
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get spoken to on a daily basis with
people who are sick, and I mean nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know River Rock sees over a hundred
thousand people annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big part of what River Rock
brought to the table with United Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that they brought this incredible
empirical evidence, this sort of data
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming right from the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll let Tony talk a little bit about
that because they created a program so
[SPEAKER_01]: that information would not be lost,
but so that information could be accessed
[SPEAKER_01]: in a new interesting type of way that
allows for more knowledge to be gained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started, you know, everyone starts by
saying, hey, try this strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be really good for your Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or try this hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be really good for your back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you look at the research and you
start to study what's called cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: pharma kinetics, and you start to look at
how long does active THC, active CBD stay
[SPEAKER_03]: in your liver, stay in your brain?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long does that take to process?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of really new,
interesting books and literature that's
[SPEAKER_03]: come about, more publications are coming
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's two fundamentals that we
really focused on, which was microdosing
[SPEAKER_03]: and the stacking method.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of you know the stacking method
when you think of Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people have been exposed to
Gupta and his entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to call it the full spectrum
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think of whole plant, full
spectrum, full terpene restoration type of
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine that can be delivered in inactive
and active microdosing as well as stacking
[SPEAKER_03]: methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes our system a little bit
different is kind of like the bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: We separated cannabis high-rich CBD
strains and high THC with high terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile strains into four categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those categories are simple one,
two, three, four, breakfast, lunch,
[SPEAKER_03]: dinner, and bedtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each one of those categories
represents different types of whole plant
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine in the sense that P1 is all whole
plant THCA with terpene profiles that
[SPEAKER_03]: match those particular strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking to breed high THC
with something that you found in the
[SPEAKER_03]: research that would create pain relief,
anti-inflammatory, energy, increased
[SPEAKER_03]: appetite, then you would use those
terpenes as modulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the extraction process of trying to
get where people were at probably two
[SPEAKER_03]: years and before was simply just taking
water hash or taking their hash oil
[SPEAKER_03]: combined with coconut oil and trying to
create a simple delivery system because
[SPEAKER_03]: most of us don't want to use alcohols or
solvents or chemicals in the medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so ideally what we're talking about,
because it sounds kind of confusing I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sure out there, is allowing to take a
whole plant and its medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_03]: and categorizing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a category 1 P1 would be high THC with
certain terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: A category 2 would be high CBD,
low THCA with certain terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: A category 3 would be the close ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a category 4 would be fully activated
CBD, fully activated CBN, creating a one
[SPEAKER_03]: to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those four ratios, those four categories
allows patients and physicians to sequence
[SPEAKER_03]: full spectrum cannabinoid therapies for
any ailment so it no longer is in a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dial in the type of combination as
an example, autism might take an active
[SPEAKER_03]: P2, two milligrams for breakfast and for
lunch and an active P4 for dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six milligrams changes a person's life for
$1.30.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of trying to concentrate 70
milligrams of a flour or 250 milligrams
[SPEAKER_03]: into a piece of hash to then smoke it
because then it's one dimensional type of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid and one type of delivery
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So between the microdosing and the
capsules and the categories, we've
[SPEAKER_03]: basically created a way to allow
physicians and patients to use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids similar to music notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that you guys have done,
and if Tony's confusing a few of you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just give you a really brief low down
on what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking pure plant profile,
he's talking about the resin off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that produces the medicines,
so the glandular trichomes, whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been extracted via water hash,
via trichome heavy extracts that do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the work for them in Colorado,
or whether it's been dry sifted or even
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's been hydrocarbon extracted by
Giddy with Emotec.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take those resins and then they break
them down, they know the exact amounts per
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram per pill and the pill should
really be called capsules because all they
[SPEAKER_01]: really are are capsules filled with
coconut oil and I believe he used palm oil
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so coconut oil causes problems
because there's actually patients out
[SPEAKER_03]: there that are allergic to coconut oil and
so you start to see thousands of patients
[SPEAKER_03]: and you start having people come back with
burning sensations down their throat
[SPEAKER_03]: because they took coconut oil pills and
it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we brought on a medical advisor that
discovered step cells in 1988 and is one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the leading cancer and tumor research
scientists on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has two hundred peer-reviewed articles
and developed what's called patient
[SPEAKER_03]: avatars, so he's actually created what's
called cancerna, five natural plant-based
[SPEAKER_03]: herbs that have been put together to
create a synergistic effect to fight
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer in tumors in children and so his
patient avatar work actually removes the
[SPEAKER_03]: stem cells out of the patient while being
treated with chemo or radiation and then
[SPEAKER_03]: using natural supplements and specialized
types of foods to bring back that system,
[SPEAKER_03]: get them through the chemo and the
radiation, then reinstall all the stem
[SPEAKER_03]: cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the technology to recreate that
in rodent studies and so what we're able
[SPEAKER_03]: to do now is extrapolate cancer patients,
autoimmune, autism, epilepsy, MS,
[SPEAKER_03]: fibromyalgia and recreate those patient
avatar simulators and be able to dial in
[SPEAKER_03]: those particular categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of chasing the holy grail or
chasing that strain or chasing that one
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD oil, now this has been put into a
software that physicians can understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple for patients to understand
because once you create the bridge between
[SPEAKER_03]: the two and allow the two best delivery
methods for this type of medicine and the
[SPEAKER_03]: flexibility, then you can dial in any
condition and you can do it very
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively and not cost yourself a lot of
money and that's really been the big thing
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess I'll also go back to a
little bit of an explanation because I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess we're assuming a lot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have a system in our bodies called
the endocannabinoid system and this system
[SPEAKER_01]: regulates much of the biological function
that goes on in our body including when we
[SPEAKER_01]: go to sleep and when we wake up and when
we have to go to the bathroom and when we
[SPEAKER_01]: get hungry and how well we remember and so
how it does that is it regulates our
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system and our central nervous
system and it puts them into harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we are in disharmony with those
two systems it usually means that our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you an idea of the importance of
cannabinoids, breast milk in women
[SPEAKER_01]: produces essential amino acids which are
basically the building blocks of life and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you ask your doctor why that is they
don't usually know but those amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: actually produce endocannabinoids inside
your body so the endo meaning endogenously
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of you and then cannabinoids
cannabis produces what are called phyto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and so we can use those not
necessarily as well as the smoking and
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizing aspect that's great for tremors
and it's great for ocular pressure and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's great for increasing appetite but
what Tony's talking about for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different ailments the importance is
to eat and consume orally or use creams or
[SPEAKER_01]: use these drops and get these cannabinoids
into your system so they can do the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that they do which is basically find the
CB1 and CB2 receptors that are found in
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain and in your peripheral organs
and what you know by basically I use the
[SPEAKER_01]: metaphor that a lot of us are blown away
we think it's amazing when Dr. William
[SPEAKER_01]: Courtney gave that young little baby girl
eight months old she had the brain tumor
[SPEAKER_01]: in her head splitting the hemispheres of
her brain and he started giving her the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil phyto cannabinoids and of
course her tumor shrunk like miraculously
[SPEAKER_01]: and Tony has literally dozens and dozens
and maybe hundreds and hundreds of these
[SPEAKER_01]: stories of people with bone cancer and
metastatic breast cancer and people with
[SPEAKER_01]: autism that have never led a normal life
and one time after another it's always the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing isn't it Tony it's a miracle
yeah so once you start data-basing those
[SPEAKER_03]: results that's what kind of drove us
that's literally what drove us to do Unite
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis and then it was kind of our
fiduciary duty if you will to bring that
[SPEAKER_03]: information to light and it started with
rubs it started with tinctures it started
[SPEAKER_03]: with strains and now it's literally some
lingual drops and capsules in what I call
[SPEAKER_03]: bio nutrient so most people that are
terminal or people that are having to rely
[SPEAKER_03]: on medicine also rely on their medicine as
a food and so bio nutrient medicinals and
[SPEAKER_03]: so we were talking about coconut oil
before and coconut oil is okay it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good we used a proprietary blend between
coconut palms as well as polarizing that
[SPEAKER_03]: and then utilizing now actual terpene
extractions to then be able to pull
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's live resin or the different
backs into that plant fat so that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the newer thing I like the way you just
held up the pure vile of terpenes like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was nothing pretty cutting-edge stuff
right here it's been only in the last year
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been reading about K from
trichome technologies you can smell it
[SPEAKER_01]: later too yeah we'll definitely let you do
a smell test this is Tony's own creation I
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually speaking with K months ago
and he was telling me you got to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out terpene extraction this is gonna be
the big thing you got to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it back out of the water you of course
I make a lot of water hash and that water
[SPEAKER_01]: hash of course is losing water-soluble
terpenes it's losing terpenes and now I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember Jim Frayer saying on the Adam
Dunn show recently and he must be a
[SPEAKER_01]: chemist he's definitely a very intelligent
man but he was saying that the water can't
[SPEAKER_01]: reach the wax membrane but I disagree I
think that once the head breaks off and it
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks away from the capitate stock that
that thin membrane underneath the head is
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing terpenes to be released into the
water as well as water being absorbed into
[SPEAKER_01]: the wax membrane and this is why we all
know any one of us that have made water
[SPEAKER_01]: hash that really the most difficult thing
in making water hash is actually drying
[SPEAKER_01]: the final product the water and the ice
gets all the credit I'm sorry it's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: all the work it's isolating the resin it's
decontaminating everything for you at 99%
[SPEAKER_01]: so please give the water and the ice some
credit and after that it's really like
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think the extract artist is is the
guy who really knows how to control his
[SPEAKER_01]: variables and to get that hash properly
dry so what Tony's done with those
[SPEAKER_01]: water-soluble terpenes is he's figured out
a way to extract them in a pure form so a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people that follow me try to wonder
like what am I doing with terpenes so the
[SPEAKER_03]: fun side of that is obviously response so
if you reintroduce that into a full melt
[SPEAKER_03]: or a live resin or anything else like that
they act as modulators and we've known
[SPEAKER_03]: that from people like Robert Clark and
David Watson people that talk before us
[SPEAKER_03]: they act as modulators and so these things
that we see as terpenes and we look at
[SPEAKER_03]: them as flavors and smells they actually
are catalysts for THC as well as all the
[SPEAKER_03]: other cannabinoids so now there's the
DaVinci code goes a little deeper or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rubik's code goes a little deeper when you
start looking at species across the world
[SPEAKER_03]: resin genetics terpene profiles that then
lock in key with cannabinoids and then
[SPEAKER_03]: those get delivered to the central nervous
system or the immune system those two
[SPEAKER_01]: deliveries excellent I guess leading into
the water extraction and losing of the
[SPEAKER_01]: water solubles has also led me over the
years of course you've mentored by guys
[SPEAKER_01]: like Rob Clark and the Scout man I've been
led into the wonderful world of dry sift
[SPEAKER_01]: as many of you know I've been sharing
techniques that I'm available to that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: able to I've learned a few new tricks over
the years and have been just sharing with
[SPEAKER_01]: people the simple aspects of having a
quiver if you're a hash maker and you
[SPEAKER_01]: think of each arrow that's in your quiver
as one of your techniques or one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: methods to me the more arrows the better
and so dry sifting is it's the holy grail
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion and before you're making
your oil before you're making your wet
[SPEAKER_01]: wash it's never a bad idea to look into a
little dry sifting it's different it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: based on prohibition based model in this
day and age the same way as cutting your
[SPEAKER_01]: herb fresh drying it and selling it how
much can I get and how fast can I get it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really more of a intimate
relationship with the plant that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the plant yourself you can hang it
you can practice hanging it for different
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of times and you'll learn in this
amazing way that oh wow the plant releases
[SPEAKER_01]: resin differently depending on how I just
cure it so dry sifting is really not a
[SPEAKER_01]: misnomer the word dry is very important
the dry ice of course has sort of confused
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of people now make dry dry sift
using dry ice which I think is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely worth it's doable but you run
into a couple of variables that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be problematic which is a cleaning the
hash dry resin glands and I wish I had
[SPEAKER_01]: photos you guys can maybe you do already
but you can check me out on BC bubble man
[SPEAKER_01]: on Instagram and all the photos are there
all the resin gland photos if you see my
[SPEAKER_01]: resin gland photos when they're living on
the plant they're very bulbous and they
[SPEAKER_01]: look like a water balloon ready to burst
as opposed to when the plants been dried
[SPEAKER_01]: properly the resin shrinks like a resin a
raisin sorry resin raisin and it really is
[SPEAKER_01]: much easier to work with whether you're
carding whether you're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: two-screen trick that I've been sharing
for the last maybe six months I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: from a guy online but he became such an
incredible douchebag I can't even give him
[SPEAKER_01]: a shout out on it so that's unfortunate I
do like to give credit where it is due but
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't give him credit so this guy came
up with a really cool idea and I will
[SPEAKER_01]: share it with you guys it's a dry sift
concept and it's it's two screens that are
[SPEAKER_01]: much larger than your average size dry
sift screens most of you that do sift
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you know 150 160 180 micron is a
pretty big screen I know there's a company
[SPEAKER_01]: out there called eight eight extractors or
something and they sell a tumbler with a
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 micron screen I think that's
incredibly large for dry sifting but most
[SPEAKER_01]: use it about a 150 so this trip uses a 250
micron and a 180 micron and I figure while
[SPEAKER_01]: we're up here talking about all this crazy
stuff I should at least give you a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of hash tips so here's one for you the 250
and the 180 I saw them both you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: them both anywhere as a silk screener but
you won't be able to order them in micron
[SPEAKER_01]: silk is measured in lines per inch or mesh
so if you want those two screens you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna ask for a 90 mesh and a 60 mesh and
you're gonna be a little confused because
[SPEAKER_01]: the 60 is gonna go on top of the 90 okay
these are counterintuitive numbers micron
[SPEAKER_01]: is the size of the hole mesh in lines per
inch or just that they are how many lines
[SPEAKER_01]: of silk you can get in one inch and so
it's not based on the diameter of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole counterintuitive numbers the bigger
the number is for microns the smaller the
[SPEAKER_01]: number is for lines per inch so really
remember that 60 micron 60 lines per inch
[SPEAKER_01]: screen which is the 250 micron goes on top
and it sits like a dish so the sides of
[SPEAKER_01]: the frame are going up and you put that on
top of your 90 lpi which is a 180 but
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of keeping it the right way you
flip it upside down so now the screen is
[SPEAKER_01]: flush and there's no there's no edges it's
just the screens that I sell or any silk
[SPEAKER_01]: screen you flip that one upside down on
the bottom put four spacers on the corner
[SPEAKER_01]: and let and set the other 60 lines per
inch screen the 250 micron I'll keep
[SPEAKER_01]: repeating both numbers because it's
totally confusing you put it on top now
[SPEAKER_01]: the way this process works is there's
about a quarter of an inch space between
[SPEAKER_01]: the two screens and what happens is is
when you throw material down whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: sift or plant matter it the way the resin
falls is the gland heads fall like stones
[SPEAKER_01]: straight through because the screens are
so big they don't really get caught up on
[SPEAKER_01]: anything so they just fall straight
through now the capitate stocks the
[SPEAKER_01]: systolic hairs and the stigmas and any
really other smaller components of
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants they fall like this and they
do this little thing when they hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: second screen because they're doing this
they usually stick right into it it's
[SPEAKER_01]: quite something to lift the first screen
and if you get down on the table and you
[SPEAKER_01]: look even with it it's just trees of
contaminant it's it's unbelievable and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you touch it like that you just dropped
50% of that camp contaminant through so it
[SPEAKER_01]: is super ultra delicate so you're not
working the material you're literally
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing material down lifting both
screens very gently and on the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: you're basically being left with what I
would call between you know the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it you'll do it wrong so you get
like 80% heads but if you start learning
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's totally counterintuitive to how
much can I get and how fast can I get it
[SPEAKER_01]: so you want to go slow and you don't want
to try to get a lot because the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: process is to get you know what we've been
talking about that standardization of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and for 15 years as a hash maker
and a cannabis grower I've really been led
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know it offends some people I love
the cannabis plant I just don't look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud as something that I use other than
to make hash that's what I do with it it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a it's a carrier that brings me the
ability to produce a raw product that is
[SPEAKER_01]: of extreme medicinal value and I can do
that with cannabis on a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: levels I can extract the heavy amino acid
rich seed oil if I want to acquire that
[SPEAKER_01]: from the seeds I can acquire the fiber
from the stock if I want to make clothing
[SPEAKER_01]: or textile products I can even extract the
cellulose from inside the stock and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: notice what all those things have in
common is you never use them all you only
[SPEAKER_01]: take the one from the hole always with
canvas one from the hole one from the hole
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my pizza box analogy when I order a
pizza I generally like to open the box and
[SPEAKER_01]: take the pizza out and eat it so I do
respect cannabis I love the plant and we
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't get the resin or the fiber or the
cellulose or the essential amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: without it but I really do see it as a
plant that is particularly the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: components are things that we can extract
and the more we decontaminate them which
[SPEAKER_01]: is what this does all about the more we
seem to learn and it's why guys like us
[SPEAKER_01]: are really at this point in time on the
edge of this information that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about for I mean 25 years these
guys Rob and skunk man and the variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys that have been doing this for
40 plus years keep in mind like they
[SPEAKER_01]: really did know most of what we know today
really the new information that you should
[SPEAKER_01]: be sinking your teeth into is learning
about as much about your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system as you can learn because once you
learn about that you can then share with
[SPEAKER_01]: all the people I can't even imagine how
many people all these people in this room
[SPEAKER_01]: know combined that are dying of cancer
right now just one disease and you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: all know more people that are suffering
from other things so we can learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: this if we can extract these resins if we
can learn about terpene modulation if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can learn about endocannabinoid saturation
through programs like the act now and
[SPEAKER_01]: through these legal models we've been
stuck in a prohibition model for so long
[SPEAKER_01]: and right now we're in a situation where I
see a lot of people I see the activists
[SPEAKER_01]: that I grew up with and came up in this
some of them are sort of looking into this
[SPEAKER_01]: new I don't know if I call it corporate
model but it's a legal model it's a model
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not based on a profit margin
that's based on you or me going to jail
[SPEAKER_01]: okay the profit margin that we have been
making off of cannabis for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: however many decades has been based on
prohibition it's been based on people
[SPEAKER_01]: going to jail that's a terrible dollar
that's not a good market so I think if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can take these products and bring them
into a new model a model that is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition model one that doesn't you
know I support dispensaries I support
[SPEAKER_01]: every single person being able to grow for
themselves having a license being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: even trade or potentially sell it within
their community I also support you know
[SPEAKER_01]: companies doing it on a large level with
standardizations that are able to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for more than just at one coffee
shop or more than just five dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's a big world out there
there's seven billion people and we all
[SPEAKER_01]: have endocannabinoid systems anything you
want to add to them?
[SPEAKER_03]: that was long that's okay wow there was a
lot there so I look at cannabis kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like bananas and it's like if we took
bananas off this planet what would happen
[SPEAKER_03]: to the human on earth and we've seen that
even growing up as a kid they said look
[SPEAKER_03]: how good bananas are we take bananas out
of society everybody loses protein
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorus the whole world changes and we
just die from bananas well that's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: what cannabis is to me cannabis is a food
it's a medicinal herb it's a medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: food it's something that your body has to
have it's preventative it's management and
[SPEAKER_03]: in the future it'll be regenerative so
when people are coming up to you and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're an old person and saying okay your
insurance program shows that I can replace
[SPEAKER_03]: your liver we're just gonna print one out
for you we're gonna slap it in there
[SPEAKER_03]: you're about 75 so we'll give you about 80
minutes to recover and if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: properly functioning endocannabinoid
system where the serum is in that organ it
[SPEAKER_03]: may not take there's gonna be all kinds of
crazy new future things by the time I'm 80
[SPEAKER_03]: years old 37 in January so I try to look
at things in the future and say how can we
[SPEAKER_03]: lay out a map how can we lay out these
things and I think this is a good start
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said I'm gonna bring it back to the
resident for you every time perfect and
[SPEAKER_03]: the bags are a good start because it's the
first eye opener we went from taking
[SPEAKER_03]: grinded butt and putting it into a glass
of water with ice and watching the little
[SPEAKER_03]: heads fall so I do sound and then we went
to a couple screens we went to clay bowls
[SPEAKER_03]: we've had centuries of beating beating
dried aged butt down and resin down into
[SPEAKER_03]: Keith Morocco all these different hashes
and things and then you get into isolator
[SPEAKER_03]: bags and bubble bags and then you say okay
well I've gone from two screens three
[SPEAKER_03]: screens four screens five screens what are
those screens really mean I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really important to understand that
because a lot of hashmakers just get
[SPEAKER_03]: material and then they go and then they
have these results and they go awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: drill turkey this was really greasy this
one this one feels really strong I tested
[SPEAKER_03]: 70% with this one but if you were growing
for your bags or you were growing your
[SPEAKER_03]: resin for the specific purpose you pay a
little bit more attention before you start
[SPEAKER_03]: processing different attention so you
would start from the very beginning you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: use the little eyepiece and you'd watch
the little resin heads and you watch how
[SPEAKER_03]: many gather together and if there's not a
topside party with little resin heads and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not huge like you were talking
about there's probably a problem and we
[SPEAKER_03]: went to Jamaica we looked at tons of
different tons of different but we watched
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched bags with you and literally
looked at the 90 back as if it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled out of a brand new set I couldn't
believe it actually when I saw that I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought I looked at the at the bag with
the scope because I thought we're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: on it we don't print the wrong bags on the
wrong screens it's like we've got that
[SPEAKER_01]: down and I still just couldn't believe it
I thought this has to be like a like a 160
[SPEAKER_03]: bag or something it was you know it was
three days of harvesting ice first of all
[SPEAKER_03]: to get ice in Jamaica so he was surprised
that I actually even was able to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: ice in the middle of mountains nowhere I
was like yeah I got ice I've been working
[SPEAKER_03]: on the ice situation John was helping
everybody was helping with the air had a
[SPEAKER_03]: five gallon bucket we had everything right
except the resin except the resin and the
[SPEAKER_03]: resin itself wasn't that good when you
looked at it you know you looked at it
[SPEAKER_03]: under the scope first thing we said was oh
did you guys have a drought and was this a
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa that got drowning so if you look at
a sativa that's supposed to be a long
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle that's supposed to be outside for a
long time and you watch how the trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: head develops and you watch it go clear
and you're looking at day 70 80 90 those
[SPEAKER_03]: are really important if you have a drought
halfway through it and your head's never
[SPEAKER_03]: developed well now all of a sudden you got
these little tiny skinny skinny stalks and
[SPEAKER_03]: these little shrunken down heads that
never even developed into a head it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: little stalks no we did see that
absolutely it was surprising just to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a little background on the history as
we mentioned Sadhusan it was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I've ever seen mentioned about
water extraction was in 1988 in the high
[SPEAKER_01]: times magazine Sadhusan took out the ad
and it was Sadhusan's water extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: secret and it was basically the jar method
so that was the first time we really heard
[SPEAKER_01]: about water extraction in 1997 a gentleman
by the name of Reinhard Delp came to
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam and he brought a machine with
him called the ice cold extractor and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ice cold extractor was sold to Mila and
Mila the pollinator lady had the ice cold
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor and sitting on her couch one day
Elden RIP Elden we miss you he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: passed away a few years now old-school
hashishen and my manufacturer Mark Rose
[SPEAKER_01]: were sitting on the couch looking at this
machine and decided to Elden shouted out
[SPEAKER_01]: two nylon bags with screen bottoms and a
five gallon bucket you got the same idea
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is the birth of the isolator bags
about a year later I came out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble bags and that was 1999 so from 97
we had well from 88 we had Sadhusan we had
[SPEAKER_01]: a long lapse people didn't get it they
just didn't pick up what he was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: Reinhard's machine people kind of lifted
their eyebrows a little bit but the bags
[SPEAKER_01]: were brilliant you know Elden coming up
with the bag idea and Mark Rose naming
[SPEAKER_01]: them right there and Mila being the
pollinator lady and bringing them to the
[SPEAKER_01]: world and selling them it was really that
team of people that made the wall that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how what I saw that's how I came along to
make bubble bags and you know we came up
[SPEAKER_01]: with the first three system three screen
system we came up with the first four
[SPEAKER_01]: screen system the first five the first six
the first seven and the first eight and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got to give it up to my boy Jason from
payload bags because he has the only nine
[SPEAKER_01]: bag system he got the first one and the
only one so he's a part of it too this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the history you can read about it on the
internet there's all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_01]: water hash companies now I only bring up
the history because recently after eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years of being litigated by Reinhard who
does indeed have a patent for water
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction I finally just you know started
talking to him like a human being and we
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up making a deal and I've now just
paid for all 15 years that I've sold
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble bags they've been leased under
patent and our company is now selling bags
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good to sort of give those you know
who have a position it's good that they
[SPEAKER_01]: earn what they should earn so bubble bags
is now a patented leased product and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know there's there's a little bit
of water hash history for you so let's uh
[SPEAKER_03]: let's talk about I want to talk about
because I don't think everyone in the room
[SPEAKER_03]: understands a different bag terminology
and so let's say that let's say somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: grew their their cannabis plants correctly
and they had a OG Kush or OG Kush dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: what bags would you would you say you
would see more collection of the heads and
[SPEAKER_03]: why in those variations so I think it's
important well in a surprise with the OG's
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see resin that melts in the
160 bag if you've grown it properly you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have these big fat 160 heads that you can
catch and that's that's the red bag that's
[SPEAKER_01]: three bags down and that's really the
reason I have the 190 bag a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: ask me why do I need a 160 if I have a 190
or vice versa and I usually say well
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you grow your weed really
properly and you're growing these into
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant strains indoor under HPS lights
that you're gonna produce these really
[SPEAKER_01]: really fat heads and that it's it's nice
to have 160 full mount I wouldn't say by
[SPEAKER_01]: any means it's my favorite but I certainly
would never throw away my 160 bag because
[SPEAKER_01]: the 120 bag for sure on the OG is gonna be
straight fire and it's gonna be all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down through 90 and 73 45 and the 25
will melt as well but on the OG's it just
[SPEAKER_01]: won't be the same quality as between like
120 and 73 and that's really based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of the head so when I first released
all these bags if you can imagine many
[SPEAKER_01]: people thought that I was just trying to
sell bags that I was adding bags because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was adding money and the more money
that people spent the more sales I made
[SPEAKER_01]: and it really couldn't be further from the
truth we tested Mark Rosen I'm my
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer he helped me out an enormous
amount we tested so many of these bags he
[SPEAKER_01]: lives in Katmandu Nepal so he has no
shortage of land-raised strains to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: off the back mountain and run through the
bags I'm in BC if you've ever seen my
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel you definitely know I have
no shortage of strains to run through the
[SPEAKER_01]: bags so between you know that was really
the work that Mark and I did was finding
[SPEAKER_01]: the right size bags it's not like we just
picked random numbers although I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: that the yellow 73 bag could have easily
been a 70 but I was born in 1973 so I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that I would throw my year in
there for a lot of people don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't know that and that
was before the 90 bags so imagine if you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand water hash the 90 and the 73
are almost always the best regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: strain unless you're growing a tropical
exotic grown land-raised sativa in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia somewhere under the super hot
Sun then the heads like I'm telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: the 25 and the 45 and where I based that
on is I used to have a good friend named
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mulan Bimbi he was a madman he was
from overgrown days and he was living in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mulan Mulan Bimbi in Australia and his
father was part of the group that bred up
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you could call it bread
it's a it's a it's a mix mash of strains
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic sativas land-raised sativas that
these old guys saw in the 70s and the 80s
[SPEAKER_01]: in Australia and they bred them all
together and I'm telling you the play I
[SPEAKER_01]: seen pictures of 15 plus pound plants 18
feet or sorry 15 feet tall and 18 to 20
[SPEAKER_01]: feet wide and the crazy bastard used to
send me his bud and his hash so it was in
[SPEAKER_01]: fact at Breeder Steve's wedding one of the
last joints I ever smoked it's gotta be 14
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago now I smoked a joint of the
Mulan Bimbi madness with Steve right
[SPEAKER_01]: before he got married on the beach in the
Savile Beach but the water hash that he
[SPEAKER_01]: sent was completely unique and exotic and
just looking at it right away he knew it
[SPEAKER_01]: was special it had tinges of red it had
the spiciest most exotic flavors in it was
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 micron now keep in mind 25 micron when
I came out with that bag well-known hash
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers laughed at me they said that is a
ridiculous bag that is immature and broken
[SPEAKER_01]: heads and you are absolutely it is proof
that you do not know what you're doing by
[SPEAKER_01]: adding that bag I'm telling you I got a
lot of flack for it and it was years
[SPEAKER_01]: before those same companies copied me and
put a 25 micron bag in there in their kit
[SPEAKER_01]: so don't diss on the 25 particularly if
you live in a tropical region and even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't I've heard people pulling out
fire from their indoor crops the 25 and
[SPEAKER_03]: the 45 if you know jibs he'll especially
like with the banner we talked about the
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 the 90 the 73 and the banner is just
the 45 melts just as good and it has in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion it has a little bit more flavor
has more flavor from the plant and then
[SPEAKER_03]: our test is kind of like if you ever had a
music studio that was my past career but
[SPEAKER_03]: we used to have these little Yamahas that
would sit up so we had these badass huge
[SPEAKER_03]: speakers we had all this really good gear
and then when you go to master you put
[SPEAKER_03]: these little cheap Yamahas on and so you
listen to the music and if you could hear
[SPEAKER_03]: every little thing in those flat cheap
Yamaha speakers then you knew the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: mastering of the entire album was correct
so it's when you pull the 25 bag if the 25
[SPEAKER_01]: bag is full now then you know you got
something I mean pretty much that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee if your 25 micron bag is melting
you're gonna have nice hash throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the bags for sure so I don't
know I think we're gonna talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: future well the future well the future is
what's in your hand right there the
[SPEAKER_03]: futures the future is it's interesting
because I think every year that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's important that you guys also look at
the cannabis cup is not a competition of
[SPEAKER_03]: who's got the best situation right now I
think it's good and healthy to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: competitions about out of all the people
that I know and the friends that I know in
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry every single person in this
competition and high times on the flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: the concentrates and the full mouth
everybody's bringing fire these days yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody has set their game up to an
ultimate level and now it's like okay if I
[SPEAKER_03]: was a judge I'd have to be going off our
preferences and now you start nitpicking
[SPEAKER_03]: well did it tickle my throat just a little
bit I'm gonna have to make a note it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like literally what it's got it's
nitpicking down to such a little bit and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think people put so much emphasis on like
who's gonna be the first second or third
[SPEAKER_03]: place and really what it comes down to is
this so this is like a snowman so it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't happen in Amsterdam there wasn't an
expo but there's still community there's
[SPEAKER_03]: still there's still a gathering there's
still this this is this is the reason why
[SPEAKER_03]: we come together to be able to network
with everybody to be able to see those
[SPEAKER_03]: faces that we see on Instagram or Facebook
and say oh I wanted to try the turpentine
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try this dry sift and so it's
about inspiring each other and inspiration
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's what's gonna lead to the future
so if somebody puts something out and they
[SPEAKER_03]: say okay we've got terpenes now well it's
important to understand with any
[SPEAKER_03]: information that's out there you have to
be responsible with that information so
[SPEAKER_03]: now it's the next chapter well just like
we had we had live resin we had VHL we had
[SPEAKER_03]: shadow who's making it what machine was
processing it you know is it closed loop
[SPEAKER_03]: where did the trim come from everybody's
got those questions now you should have
[SPEAKER_03]: the same for the next with the terpenes
where are the terpenes coming from are
[SPEAKER_03]: they coming from the canvas material are
they coming from other fruits and
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables are they coming synthetically
so you have to be educate yourself again
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's what this is about the
future is inspiring each other coming
[SPEAKER_03]: together time and time and time again not
just in Amsterdam but across the world and
[SPEAKER_03]: really see what climate genetics culture
and people can actually do in the forms of
[SPEAKER_03]: information that inspire them in those
pockets around the world pushing it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: new envelope and I'll tell you you know it
was wet wash for me why I mean I started
[SPEAKER_01]: also 16 17 years ago with oils my first
concentrates got into water hash went hard
[SPEAKER_01]: on that got into dry sift and now
literally Tony taking terpenes and adding
[SPEAKER_01]: them back into both the dry sift and the
wet wash the modulating effects the
[SPEAKER_01]: zestiness that comes with the hit it's
really definitely it's gonna be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: quiver there's no doubt about it there may
