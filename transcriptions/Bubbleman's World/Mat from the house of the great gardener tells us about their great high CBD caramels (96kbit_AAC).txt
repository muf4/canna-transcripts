[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're here with Matt the
great gardener and he's gonna tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about what's going on here So
here we have the high CBD caramels made
[SPEAKER_00]: with can of tonic butter We had surveyed
the members of the club asking them what
[SPEAKER_00]: they most were looking for in an edible
and the elderly population Had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that they wanted something that they could
suck on due to the fact that most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: Had dentures and it was hard for them to
chew on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted something that they could
just suck on and be Easy for intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came up with a caramel idea Infuse
the butter in the caramel wrap them up
[SPEAKER_00]: into individual Little candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't call them candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call them Medicinals edibles
medibles Yeah, they're quite nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few in the last couple of days
the reason I have my license is for severe
[SPEAKER_01]: arthritis from broken bones and my
collarbone often bugs me is particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm doing photography and holding my
arm up and yeah, these were great just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of melted away the pain and For me
anyway, I wasn't it didn't really make me
[SPEAKER_01]: tired or groggy or I didn't really have
any feelings of being overly Baked as you
[SPEAKER_01]: would say I just kind of was able to go on
with my day with less complaining about My
[SPEAKER_00]: collarbone and these are available at the
Vancouver Island Compassion Society
