[SPEAKER_00]: All right, John, we've come to the funnest
part of our videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically... We've done all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've, uh... Oh, let's turn that
into dry sip for our next video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi-coach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi-haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is, um, number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haki!
[SPEAKER_01]: Haki.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the headband, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so... We're gonna puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is about 80 grams of... ...oach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what that is right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do what I like so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you wanted to hit some cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you've been hitting your
dessert all day long for, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last, I don't know, how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just time to hit a little,
uh... Some Medi-haze there for you,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so, do you require a scooper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um... Actually, look at this dirty
scooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can take a little dirty
scooper of the fresh frozen, totally not
[SPEAKER_00]: dried, stuck on the unit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna taste a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have to carb cap that, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing lots of smoke going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh!
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit light, but not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: For something that was, you know,
fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, get me, like, the backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can press that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into, uh, lovely little chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, let me...
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get you an oil slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what a great time we had up in
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, that was... It was kind
of like I wasn't sure it was gonna work
[SPEAKER_00]: out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went... It always does, but,
I mean, I wasn't sure we were just...
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we found that spot right
at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remembered that I, uh, wore this
ring, so...
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top of that back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just so handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going right after the... He's hitting
the 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press it right up a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ninjaed John.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a nice flat piece of 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the old school 1994 fall tour fish
shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the fish heads out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you throw on your favorite
version of Hood for these next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: long rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great song for those that know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't, it's a simple
YouTube search away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: P-H-I-S-H.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got ninjaed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got ninjaed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got ninjaed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ninjaing off into the...
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta admit, with the de-nailer,
I'm more accepting of this sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of going off the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you can carb cap it, it'll just
sort of save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a quick little finger carb cap
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a carb cap on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's such a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get the hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're just, once again,
happy to be exempt federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy that we still have our licenses
until March 31st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, right now, the licensing as
it sits, it allows John and I to get
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to do the things you see us
doing and share them with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the worry of any sort of negative
consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which really, when you're sharing things
like what John and I are sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there ever should be a
negative consequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're really talking about
here is actually how to extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine out of the plant properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how I'm properly able to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that worries me,
what we just talked about, which is with
[SPEAKER_01]: the program ending with Health Canada as a
medical marijuana access regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I personally and Mark personally can
grow her own medicines in her house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now I will not be able to access
making fresh frozen or making the bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash that I've been using now for quite
some time for my pain control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually... Basically doing all
the things we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll have to actually buy it from a
commercial production facility to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with whatever they give me,
then I can try and make something which
[SPEAKER_00]: is...
[SPEAKER_00]: But will that be legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the buying it will be illegal,
but once we buy it and take it home,
[SPEAKER_00]: are we allowed to extract resin from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're pretty much allowed to do
whatever we want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the new regulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know here in BC we're kind of
safe, but the rest of Canada is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I think even though... So that's
pretty bad for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's all changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it's important that everyone
pay attention that's involved in this to
[SPEAKER_00]: the coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're website... MMAR Coalition Against
Repeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that dot... Dot CA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot CA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's the Canadian version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, check that out online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find us on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much Google MMAR Coalition Against
Repeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will find all the links of where
you can actually help fight for our cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Domation and everything you can do is
drawing awareness towards what is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening here in Canada with our federal
system that has been legal since 2001 for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are suffering from disabilities
and other ailments related to their health
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are going to be forced to buy
from basically a commercial producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a bigger corporate... Corporate
takeover on the medical marijuana...
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to control the production
and they're going to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think personally that it's a
component that is necessary for a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: group of our population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that, you know, vapor bars and
dispensaries and growing your own is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have... They can still grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can actually buy a legal...
Completely legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can actually grow their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to go do some filming
in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten minutes from my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow cannabis legally here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow cannabis legally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tell you, don't talk about it at the
border between those two places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard some pretty horror stories on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I really love right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can look over and see into the
gorilla tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the four by two foot screens
balancing nicely on the bubble bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: the tumble now with the hash securely on
the cardboard and covered by the screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's... I can't wait to come back
after you come back from your glorious
[SPEAKER_00]: trip to Prince George to go and do some of
your fine work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's coming up on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the next bubble man adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go see D420K, the dry sift
master up in Prince George.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's apparently got some state of the art
facilities that he wants to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some dry sifting,
some bubble hash making, and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, back country sledding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going for the high five,
but then I saw the pipe and everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: like...
[SPEAKER_00]: Low five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be great just to see
Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always had good times cruising
around on our bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my ride buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely loves riding on this Harley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually cruising behind them in my
truck during the summer because I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, mind you, I used to do a lot of
riding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up riding motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sitting here thinking about just how
great it is to be able to enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural life of... The very last ride.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite nice and the way things are
happening worldwide and the way people are
[SPEAKER_01]: waking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just look over here at your Facebook
page and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so much information that's
exploding on the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hiding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body's on TAC and how it regulates the
central air system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite amazing what's happening
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's why we're going to see Canada
open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see more than even
what we're hoping for, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfathering of the growers who have
already had their licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's fair to the rest of
the Canadian citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone always has to have the
right to be able to grow, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: what year they might have gotten their
license and more importantly, regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: of their ailment, because we should not be
classifying ailments as certain ones be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever your ailment is, you want to
improve your quality of life and no one's
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life is worth more than anyone
else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they want pharmaceutical pills
to be, but they aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical pills are pure and
straightforward poison that just kill
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addiction of it and the months of it,
it's like short periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I broke my collarbone, they gave me
pain meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose not to take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt all the pain that was terribly
painful for about five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chose not to take the medicine,
the T3s and whatever other things they
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to offer me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I felt like the damage that
those would do to my liver and to my body
[SPEAKER_00]: and the potential addictive qualities just
weren't worth it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, albeit it was only one bone,
I wasn't in traction in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: In acute stages, there is an opioid system
and we do know it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get all kinds of different stuff and
stuff like that, but definitely it is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that works very well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to take a hit of the Kush and I
will ninja dab you the 90U flavor saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you have breakfast and dinner
all at once, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, no sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clear dome right on the end of the
dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daisy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so damn tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I hope you guys all enjoyed the
Whistler video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has inspired another Whistler video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Dope Industries on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw him at the Southside Diner
when we were ordering our breakfast and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was a bearded guy that was sitting in the
corner dabbing wave to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just texted him today and was kind of
like, was that you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, what about a collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the Dope Industries boys
and bubble men.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do a video of us making hash out
there on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then these guys are in the background
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the rails and they get features
and they do backcountry and sledding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all pretty killer riders and
I'm stoked to come chill out with you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: and play some bowls and make some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope John makes it out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best, but backcountry riding
for me is a slow trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we might be able to get into an easy
zone where we just, you know, get you
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere that's nice and close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we should just continue on,
puff our way out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next show, actually, is going to be
this 114 or 115 grams of Haki cross with
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to photograph it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grind it and we're going to
dry sift it for Ed's dash for John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, till next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we puff our way out of here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit a first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just hit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my little pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit all three of these.
This is just a little bit different
attempt.
We might as well finish this one off.
Sure.
Which one do we got?
That's the Haki.
Oh, well, I won't take it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's a sheet on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my little pony.
I hope you know what's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the first time I've ever
done a little pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you have it in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is a coincidence.
Puff on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought these to Toronto, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John brought these nugs to Toronto and
for whatever reason they densed up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you could drive over it with a
car for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wasn't this the one you showed all of
us and we were all tripping out about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the hardest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it not the hardest one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I mistaken?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I thought it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, wild to do that VC cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the humidity and it's like fluffy
and marshmallowy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take it on the plane and it's
just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to a nice dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, yeah, that's how I grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one more reason how this thing that
is the internet is classic for,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the assumption of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see it all the time where I'll
post a photo of a friend of mine's pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thousand people will assume,
you know, I'm a huge baller because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: my pipe and it's not my pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it with the texture of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: People post the texture of hash and then
others assume that that person is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the texture of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I think really what's responsible
is how well it was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You isolate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture is the texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing special processes to it to
change the texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me all the time, how,
how, how can I make it waxy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make it shatter?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you grow dank resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people ask me how you get this
killer, I was like, well, I grow organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke this stuff every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I flush for like 40 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants just give me always full
melts, beautiful flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consistently over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I met you and you made the
killer dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of confused as to why your
bubble wasn't killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had proper resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had proper resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right too because I wasn't
cleaning my resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's where I realized that once
I cleaned my resin, I didn't run just a
[SPEAKER_01]: 160 bag and a 50 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually run the 8 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand how to use the bubble
bag down the streams and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy when you start running.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, oh man, yuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you don't stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is proper 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people take out, I use a 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a 160 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go right down to the 50 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then come up with these big raw ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this so it's all compressed raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at them and go, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that don't understand, they want
the 73 and the 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to understand the other bags
are key to get those bags to be the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference between the oil
community and the hash community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke a particular sized land head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't smoke 25, generally 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us don't smoke 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us don't even smoke 120,
which I find insane because I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120, 90, and 73 are my three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will smoke 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked a killer 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would push 45 miltons over the 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outdoor sun-grown sativas and
equatorial tropical places produce amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 miltons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all have their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just important that you use them all
in order to get the ones that you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see, I like to, this is the
same hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to cure in both containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I like glass more, I find that if
I'm always willing to learn, then I'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: things, well then I'll learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find if I'm always willing to learn,
I'll learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I just think glass is the greatest
thing and there's no place for hash in
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic, then I lose any potential
possibility of a discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've learned is when you carry
your bubble hash in a glass jar,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cool it like this, and it falls,
then all that bubble falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I've actually been more
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of these little containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pack these up good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good for the trippy stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good for the... Containers are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got these containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure you put on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like mine is 73, 90, 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we were talking about, the three that
we like the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course that's a 90, isn't it?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 and 73 are my favorite, but there's
some wicked 120 out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that mine are only 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm going to have one of these.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Le Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: First couple weeks of 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means... That's not even a couple
weeks, it's only been 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like one event after another.
[SPEAKER_01]: More things happening with this whole
change, the legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there might have been a hit
there, but I think it might be...
[SPEAKER_00]: More of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I already said that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I need something strong right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice, but... This is more than
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ice wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like liquid nitrogen made ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the high-end dessert at the
high-end restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is... Every hash smoker just wants to
smoke this until they fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so freaking tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, yeah, that it's the best
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's tasty, tasty, tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I've never made anything like that
until you show me these words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beautiful thing when you
grow it properly and you do it properly
[SPEAKER_00]: that every... Not every strain,
but potentially there's a lot of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that have the potential to be
what I call the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, there might be a hundred,
there might be a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of full melt out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, I was going to start a company
with a friend called Full Melt Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just going to broker seeds
that we had assured people would produce
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt resins if grown properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I paid attention over the years to the
strains that do, and wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growing list, I'm happy to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
