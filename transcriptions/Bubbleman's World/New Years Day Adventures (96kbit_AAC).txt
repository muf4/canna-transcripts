[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so, welcome to Bubble Man's
World, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am here with Flav and Aaron from DNA
Genetics, and we have made it to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful, beautiful drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: The time of day with the orange sort of
magic hour light and then the pink
[SPEAKER_10]: mountains right as we came in to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys obviously noticed that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gotten here to our house that we've
rented.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got a whole bunch of nice Congo
on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Congo 73 second run.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Congo 73 first run.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got some Congo 90 right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You going for a dunk or you want a dab?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna go for a dunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dunk it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that ready?
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the drop down you have on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You walk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold that.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ewok.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ewok glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, let me move back so I don't feel
like I'm blocking you and you kind of move
[SPEAKER_10]: forward there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasty?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Better than the 7th, than the... Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for my dunk, I actually did kind of
dunk it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dunk it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after you, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: After me?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna hit Marcel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that little guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's check out the function on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we'll do a close up later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love that little piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta show the function on that piece
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will do a close up.
[SPEAKER_08]: These were his and hers matching pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fab egg ripping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her dooby-doppies, it's being respected.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're not smoking doobies.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, we will be soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, we will be soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I brought some mextiza that I
grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Congo that I grew that's been curing
forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to try that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have seeds of the Skywalker,
indeed, that I've never even popped.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had them for like three years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Acceptable?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, really susceptible.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got my 90 right here when I just hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Flav brought a plethora of epic
glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chop your head off when you stand up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back into the screenshot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We brought the Marcel Depi Fab Egg.
[SPEAKER_08]: We brought the his and hers matching
Marcel mini rippers.
[SPEAKER_08]: The mini rippers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got two dosas and a punty tube with
some disk flips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really nice Alice in Wonderland disk
flips, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I saw that tube.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little worm sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't even remember what the hell
else we brought.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw FDK in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: FDK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, don't leave home without it,
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a Toro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a Toro from the Toke City
fifth year anniversary edition one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the FDK the green one?
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that we were rolling with in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, that's like a great hitting.
[SPEAKER_08]: The best hitting.
[SPEAKER_07]: For such an expensive piece to be your
daily driver and roll out with you to a
[SPEAKER_07]: great go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been holding out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just told you when I put it in a small
jar that it was going to smell even more
[SPEAKER_10]: like cherries and fruit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, I was really enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: It got me at first into this kind of no
high zone that was very high.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was just like.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all of a sudden, I was like,
oh, no, I'm like really high, but
[SPEAKER_10]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like nothing cerebral at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like not like the Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hammer your brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to smoke no more,
son.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a good bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we want to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got a whole six more, seven more
days of adventure here in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's kind of been a bus just driving up
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids are all excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside, they're having a blast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And tomorrow, we've got Matt and Sarah
from the House of the Great Gardener
[SPEAKER_10]: arriving and then our crew will be
complete.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may have visits from higher end,
from high integrity glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may have Alex from the Hemp,
not Hemp Exchange, the Manitoba Hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh hemp foods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said he was going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I invited Johnny Berfalo up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should see John at one point in time up
here for a pop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And who knows who else?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's definitely already a crew of
people up here in Whistler that we'll bump
[SPEAKER_10]: into.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're basically trying to, you know,
do more as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a calendar, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a pretty awesome schedule.
[SPEAKER_07]: A schedule for our days here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're limited in time and we all want to
do so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And every day, it's like, OK, we're going
to do the Olympic bobble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobsledding, for instance.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all say yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: 125 kilometers an hour down the Olympic
bobsled course in the Olympic bobsled
[SPEAKER_10]: units.
[SPEAKER_10]: With vape pens.
[SPEAKER_10]: With vape pens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to have the fab egg with a battery
and a deodorant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, sitting in the back?
[SPEAKER_10]: With the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, the guy in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: The man in his glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy in the back is the brake man,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the brake man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt either one of us are, we're not
doing the four man bobsled here.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three men?
[SPEAKER_07]: Three of us?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a six man bobsled?
[SPEAKER_10]: Two and two maybe?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe like Matt and I can go and you and
Aaron can go or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this, a Jew thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: An anti-Jew thing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was going there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, ah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OK, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm OK with that kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send the Jews down first.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send them down first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they'll even say, cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: And rewind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you know, do the bobsled thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could hit the little pen on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you should be able to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, if you pick your seat in
the right spot, which I think is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be not at the back and not at the front,
but maybe right in the middle or the
[SPEAKER_10]: middle back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you get it before you get it,
the second you get it, that'll be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be right up on your boy
that you got on that thing with.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first dude is going to be the driver.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last dude's the driver.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not even going to realize the G
force of going around the turns.
[SPEAKER_10]: You think we're going to lose our pens?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're going to be getting
your pen out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're going to be holding
your pen up to your fucking mouth.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're going to be like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like fucking crashing over against this
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like crashing over against this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll just be like, dude, fuck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not think it was going to be that
intense.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think it was going to be like a
smooth line.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all turns.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like once we hit 80K, it was over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's 90 and 180 degree turns.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it does.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't just go like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: They do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to be ducking down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, as those fools, because they're
going to be the ones that are pushing off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be violent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to be already like right
when you get in, and we're like batting,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I'm like right up on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like down like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be hitting our pen right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like one, two, three, and they start
running.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to jump in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll hit the fab in the bobsled.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heat it up right before they start to
push.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll give you 30 seconds to drop the
temp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got this new pen that I can turn
it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just do like a vapor hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, turn it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is yours turned up too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yours is the... Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yours is the Trippy Stick too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he has the herbal unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's not an herbal unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got both of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the concentrate Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not the same shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've really found the Apex and Trippy
Stick to stand... Apex gives the best
[SPEAKER_10]: hits.
[SPEAKER_10]: ...ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I found was that I love Trippy Stick,
and I took it everywhere, and I used it
[SPEAKER_10]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I got the Apex, and I was like
the Apex was like... I don't even really
[SPEAKER_10]: compare it to the Trippy Stick.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a different level.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's closer to this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can just hit a small rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get something right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, an Apex pen, because the rips it
gives are insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, for like when I'm up on a glacier or
a mountain or on a boat or wherever,
[SPEAKER_10]: my Trippy Sticks are so sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: The herbal one, I've just gotten used to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to be able to hit the flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you bring all your pens?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you bring all your pens?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought like three or four pens,
so that we all had pens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought one too, so we're all good.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I broke my last pen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just hand it over to the dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I have a Leco O for my car,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've had so many different pens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the Atmos pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you hitting this one?
[SPEAKER_10]: The CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the taste on that?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really for taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly not going to like...
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a really nice idea for a session.
[SPEAKER_10]: You hit the Congo, it's just destructive.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll throw people off their game,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great high, but like Aaron said,
it's pretty much most people are done.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't need to smoke like 10 more rips
to the Congo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, you could.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just don't need to.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is more like this incredible
flavor and taste that is like the dessert.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no real hammer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're high, but there's not a hammer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is strange, because it must be the
Kanatonic influence, because the Rene
[SPEAKER_10]: also, much like the Congo, had a hammer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Massive hammer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had a ceilingless high, meaning that it
just would take you up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has one of the best tastes,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, it's the only thing I ever smoked
exclusively for two years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my buddy was growing a ridiculous
amount.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that is a long time to not get bored.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys realize tomorrow we're going
to have other hash on the table?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one more individual to smoke?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And listen, if we get higher end up here,
we'll have other other hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and we'll get higher end up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will.
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't come that first session we had,
and I made sure to tell him that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure you're not hiding
behind me.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not out of the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a weird way.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should have a seat set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're not going to hang out for much
longer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just wanted to give you guys a little
intro to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw the epic house.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fully kick-ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: If any of you want the information on how
you yourself could rent this particular
[SPEAKER_10]: house, the woman, Pam, is super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't rent it often, but when she
does rent it, it's something to take
[SPEAKER_10]: advantage of, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll see more of the place,
you'll see more of Whistler, and you'll
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely see more of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to reach you, so she won't be able to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamless, burning her power
[SPEAKER_02]: every time she closed her eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paradise, paradise, paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time she closed her eyes.
Paradise, paradise, paradise,
paradise.
Every time she closed her eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: When she was just a girl, she is back into
the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you were waiting for the rain,
so she ran away to sleep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise.
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is
[SPEAKER_10]: the end of our... Are we all fitting in?
[SPEAKER_10]: We are fitting in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to Bumbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are in the garage of the epic fucking
house that we're staying in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_10]: New Year's Eve!
[SPEAKER_10]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's like... Why not check?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would never know if I didn't
check.
[SPEAKER_06]: 7.30.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got four and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people in Canada getting close
on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the East Coast total time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Three hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all the way to the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_08]: Three and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was just three.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three to Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're right to the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be another few hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to argue it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got the dosa and I'm about to dab it
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Light flab on fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: While the rest of us are partaking in the
tasty wares of some tangy grown on the
[SPEAKER_06]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Mextiza grown on the West Coast?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is tangy, that's Mextiza.
[SPEAKER_10]: This won't be my last app in here,
but it might be the last one I take in
[SPEAKER_10]: this garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us lonely smokers, we are stuck out in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see, it's nice and warm in
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a nice heater right there,
but I can't have it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't have the heater on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes loud sounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Affects the quality of the audio.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next thing you know, we get asshole
commenters.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, this video was really hard to watch,
problem man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just way too hard to watch.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to dab with this?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's from California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell?
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you, Matt?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like a dosa, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, yes it will.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was broke.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little dab from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little dab?
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pulled it off of, maybe it's wore off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a look.
[SPEAKER_06]: Torching up in the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of warm getting close to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no dude, that's super good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like super duper duper good.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, you think so?
[SPEAKER_07]: That bong hits like a champonian.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, good day today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Up on the mountain in the whole nine
yards.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the heater.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess this video's over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Break time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're shaping it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we've got Matt the great
gardener is about to crack a firework out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will it blow up right on the deck or will
it leave?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to aim it right through that
hole there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like you're good at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the beginning until we get to
the thunder smack down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety, safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called the pastel paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going.
[SPEAKER_10]: New Year's action in Wyss.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_10]: Into the 2015.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, these are serious fireworks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy Christ.
Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, that's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bought the good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Domino's guy goes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: After this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is planet smack down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's at 12 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: We have half an hour tops to wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like, dang.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the last one was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: The last one was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was shocking how fast it came out.
[SPEAKER_10]: How did the bus come in the middle?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's wacky.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also appreciated the Domino's pizza guy
going after the monster explosion.
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole sky is lit up and he's just
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's eat this pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirk and I did a Halloween show in his
neighborhood and we pretty much alls we
[SPEAKER_05]: had those big square ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to videotape this thing because
it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you come squeeze in and give her a hug
too so she's not cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, there we go.
