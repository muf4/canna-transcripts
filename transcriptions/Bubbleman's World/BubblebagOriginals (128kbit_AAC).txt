[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so moving on to the bubble bags
original eight colors We got them right
[SPEAKER_00]: here the originals blue the 220 micron bag
the green 190 bag the red 160 micron bag
[SPEAKER_00]: the orange 120 micron bag the black 90
micron bag the yellow 73 the white 45 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple 25 micron the bubble bags
original are still untouched in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace for quality really it's since
day one I always went with the nicest
[SPEAKER_00]: highest GSM thread count I could go with
the highest grade pharmaceutical screen
[SPEAKER_00]: whether Nitex or polyethylene parachute
thread to sew the two together just really
[SPEAKER_00]: never cut any corners in the manufacturing
and in the materials that were purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: these materials are all purchased in
different countries and then flown to
[SPEAKER_00]: another country Because that's where the
best sewing job gets done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these things correlate to a
higher-end product That's why we put the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime warranty on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these bags will last for you
know, between 10 and 20 years No problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wouldn't be surprised one day when
the company is older than 15 years If we
[SPEAKER_00]: hear this there's bags that made it 30 40
years On my Facebook page just yesterday a
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman posted a set of his 12 year old
bags from 2001 All stacked inside a bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and showing all the labels nicely and just
saying, you know still in great use So
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great to see that the the bubble bags
They still demand a high price,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are respected in the industry
they're the tool of many of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: quality extract artists out there and
People respect bubble bags people like
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags along with the quality along
with the material we also offer top top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the line customer service like I said when
you offer something like a lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty, it's best to make it easier for
your customers to Actually get that
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime warranty rather than make it
difficult for them So we usually just ask
[SPEAKER_00]: a few little questions here and there but
if the bags have been defective in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: shape or form We urge you to get in touch
with us and we'll replace them So thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for tuning in here today with me a
beautiful beautiful day here in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia and I'll finish off with Showing
you a little bit of the sunset You
