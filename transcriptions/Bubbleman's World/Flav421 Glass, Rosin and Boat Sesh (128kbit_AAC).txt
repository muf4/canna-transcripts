[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sitting here in my backyard with my
good friend Flav421.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been way too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it has.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, way too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been way too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't almost know how to finish our
handshake there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been that long.
[SPEAKER_07]: White guys shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a good thing we were
high-fiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are about to be high-ing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you brought a beautiful mothership.
[SPEAKER_11]: As always, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got the Tuba Punti FTK, one of the
very first fully-worked FTKs.
[SPEAKER_11]: If not the first, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Beast is all I can say about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Beast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a tank.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not got a very small ball and small
torus like the newer ones do, but still,
[SPEAKER_11]: to this day, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got Moldavite blown in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that looks nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, super sexy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, to this day, think it's one of the
best-functioning FTKs I've ever hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bloody airplane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, today, Flav and I, we're just
sort of like, let's just get together,
[SPEAKER_07]: shoot a little video, puff some bowls,
smoke some resin, some hash, maybe press a
[SPEAKER_07]: little rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've actually got the Sasquatch press
going right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the jars, but we'll show you
those in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, have a few bowls, and maybe even
throw the boat in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would be nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, throw the boat in the water,
maybe go see some other friends that are
[SPEAKER_07]: out on their boats.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be a surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see who it is, when and if we see
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, I think we should
start it off with a Szechuan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: A Szechuan.
[SPEAKER_11]: This cookies rosin is very nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, form cut.
[SPEAKER_11]: Girls go cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cookie monster action.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, flour rosin from the flowers from
the real heavenly days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, look at that monster rip for me
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very generous, very generous.
[SPEAKER_11]: The turps on this are outstanding.
[SPEAKER_11]: People have always wanted a function video
for this pipe.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty functioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: That it hits nice and deep, boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you can take like really monster rips
on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't choke you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's major filtration going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a sizable dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a sizable dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a generous dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you spend all your time hanging out
with high integrity glass, you get used to
[SPEAKER_11]: just the monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's definitely a monster dab guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kills people.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is definitely also very generous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually gave, I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I dripped on, I did the bad party fail at
his house the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I dripped onto his table.
[SPEAKER_11]: The nice D-nail table.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he gave me a huge one and I pulled
away too fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a beautiful table.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never even seen it set up or used.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, we'll have to all Szechuan.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the high end table for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, perfect person for it to go to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: High end, higher end.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that name will never ever,
that will be the name synonymous with him
[SPEAKER_11]: forever, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The possibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it seems nowadays too, people are
more connected to those names.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, they used to,
accounts would get closed or things would
[SPEAKER_07]: happen and people would reemerge with new
names.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I often do.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the different forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, a guy just recently was hitting me
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, oh, don't you remember me?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I don't know you at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, oh, I'm so and so from back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, well I knew that name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know the person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't picture a face or hear a voice or
anything like that or understand any of
[SPEAKER_07]: the subtle nuances that people have in
their mannerisms and such.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I said, man, if you change your name,
man, I just, you're suddenly an unknown
[SPEAKER_07]: person.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed it when Facebook made me change
my name and I became Mark Richardson in my
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble man world and lots of people were
like, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this guy talking?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, just me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one thing when people like have
monikers from like back in the day,
[SPEAKER_11]: particularly like the forums and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like still to this day,
if they've kept them, they'll introduce
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves as that, but not as who they
are, like their real given name or
[SPEAKER_11]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, oh yeah, I'm
Overgrow34271.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember we were chatting like 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, it happens to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of the, one of the difference,
the differences is of meeting people
[SPEAKER_07]: online versus in actual, a lot of the
cannabis community for a long time was an
[SPEAKER_07]: online community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a sort of a behind the scenes back
door, you know, usually not really,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, more secretive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was, uh, you earned the trust
of people and your name was all that you
[SPEAKER_07]: really had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not until like the, the licenses in
Canada were not just out, but really
[SPEAKER_11]: prevalently out, you know, like a huge
volume of them were out where people would
[SPEAKER_11]: people even say like, oh yeah,
I even grow it, you know, or even like,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you just meet somebody, you know,
like, yeah, you don't often even say if
[SPEAKER_11]: you smoke it, you know, because of the
potential pitfalls that could bring.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely one of the things of the
prohibition falling and the disappearance
[SPEAKER_07]: of prohibition that I'm looking forward to
seeing an end to, which is people being
[SPEAKER_07]: worried and I've seen it in so many
aspects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the midwives being worried
about, you know, births going wrong and
[SPEAKER_07]: that the doctors or the nurses are going
to, you know, that they have to be
[SPEAKER_07]: worried.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the worry of,
you know, the cannabis user that's worried
[SPEAKER_07]: about maybe telling the wrong person that
he uses cannabis and getting fired from
[SPEAKER_07]: his job.
[SPEAKER_07]: All these silly little, like it's,
they're forms of bullyism where it's like
[SPEAKER_07]: they're being bullied based on something
that, uh, that they choose to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's such a beneficial plan and it's
all basically everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, I know, like, obviously I'm
coming from the one side of the pro
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis, but everybody's been taught
things that are mostly false over the last
[SPEAKER_11]: like 40, 50, 60 years of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so a lot of the people in their
attitudes and their information is coming
[SPEAKER_11]: from a falsity and a falsehood in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where in ultimately for me,
I find unfortunate, you know, like when
[SPEAKER_11]: you meet like another family and they find
out, oh, like you have a medical license
[SPEAKER_11]: and all this and all that, and they might
not necessarily be stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, like, I mean, it hasn't
happened with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily we live in such an understanding,
beautiful place, but I've talked to lots
[SPEAKER_11]: of people where families haven't wanted
their kids to play with the children of
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabis user for the, for no other
reason other than they use cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: they obviously don't use it in front of
their children and they keep it in a safe
[SPEAKER_11]: place, locked away, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Responsible as all hell, but they still,
you know, it's like that stigma still
[SPEAKER_11]: exists to this day where most people even
smoke the stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet alcohol rarely gets, rarely gets
locked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pharmaceutical pills rarely get locked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that whole argument of worrying
about children is almost, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that the person who says that is almost
assuredly exposing their children to far
[SPEAKER_07]: worse things on a daily, daily basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just because that's the hypocrisy
of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like it's a, it definitely makes
me want to shake my head a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me want to press a little bit of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what it makes me want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should let me go really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will do a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little pause, dab pause.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got a little bit of this and bits
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to run, press a little of this
there through the old press.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say boys?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a one, 59 through to the 73 friend of
mine grew it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a, um, pink Bubba.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put your head in there and smell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like you're smelling it for days.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked really funny up close.
[SPEAKER_09]: 20.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's some of what we're playing with
a little bit of his goopy rosin whip
[SPEAKER_07]: butter up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is the dry set for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I'm going to puff the bit that I
just touched.
[SPEAKER_07]: What better way to reserve your piece than
a little touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, what's friends oils amongst
friends on rosin patties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's, I was actually kind of making
a joke for a video that Darren and I did
[SPEAKER_07]: at a dispensary and the guy was like
pulling out the nugs and we were smelling
[SPEAKER_07]: them and people like, I don't want your,
my medicine squeezed and put under your
[SPEAKER_07]: nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can totally, totally understand
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: These videos are great for being
criticized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the internet's great for criticizing
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it makes things better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do appreciate a good critique.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the given the take.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the given the take.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, like I often wish just in and
not just, you know, video medium,
[SPEAKER_11]: just any medium out there in internet
land, but I just wish people would take 10
[SPEAKER_11]: seconds to think about something before
they actually say it or post it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause often enough, if you take that 10
seconds, you would avoid a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: bullshit that you just don't need.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are things we learn as we get older.
True.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to be quite reactionary on the
internet when I first started.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm much better now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try not to be too reactive.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even if you are, be like at least
respectful and intelligent about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of being like, well, you're a
fucking piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't agree with anything you say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it doesn't get your point across
anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was the best rip I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, I think I was looking for that
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That it's, it's, it's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: It had been cold carrying my fridge for a
few months.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, uh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got the Sasquatch rosin press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to pull it out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be so nice to just have it on
that little circular table or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll figure it out either way in a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: This video is going to transition into.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are doing some hillbilly oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making here with the Sasquatch resin press
right by the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we got her around two 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to start at two 50 and go down from
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go two 40, two 30, two 20,
uh, two 50 is the higher end of your
[SPEAKER_07]: efficiency mark on this, on the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, Dave's, uh, created a little,
uh, uh, burrito technique, a directional
[SPEAKER_07]: flow package on the inside, and then we're
just going to waterfall it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, yeah, it likes to climb forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want to make sure that the,
uh, the screen packet is inside the unit,
[SPEAKER_07]: not towards the edge or it pinches and it
breaks and, uh, nobody likes blowouts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody likes a blowout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little gooper.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just opened this one up from the
press looking pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely want to get some macro photos
of this pronto.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite, quite, quite nice looking.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is about to go in to the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the, the hash in the pack here and
what we're going to do is we're just going
[SPEAKER_07]: to do a little pre press out of the D nail
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So fold that in half.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to gently close that gently,
not on my fingers because they're in
[SPEAKER_09]: there, but keep going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all the way down, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll give us a nice, nice pre pressed
little piece that can go into the
[SPEAKER_07]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have folded up another little mini
directional pack here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got it in the parchment paper and I
guess we're going to go for another little
[SPEAKER_07]: press, just a few presses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Press for the day, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to hit that flav and bring her
down.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got it starting to come out nicely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little dark in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure it hasn't blown
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although we got into real nice color on
this left.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the first time I saw anybody do this
tech making hash, if the Jimi Hendrix song
[SPEAKER_08]: came into my head and every time I see it,
you just want to crank some Jimmy while
[SPEAKER_08]: you're doing the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we managed to whip off a little bit of
raw Xan made a nice little puck here,
[SPEAKER_07]: but another nice one down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess you're pressing out this one
right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's another one on the dabber
still.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we better take that one off right
now too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just turn that around and take that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a giant fat dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be destructive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to hit a little bit of this
one, which was the first one that we
[SPEAKER_07]: pressed where the, um, the little,
uh, screen pack wasn't blowing out,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it was squeezing out the burrito tube.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just, uh, it was strange.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd never seen that before, but it did it
twice in a row on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we still managed to harvest the
majority of said resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, first rip of the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing left in this little
[SPEAKER_07]: I took some beautiful macro photos.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to share with you right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The photos that I'm going to share is with
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, if you look at this patty up
close, because I didn't use heat to press
[SPEAKER_07]: it, all of the bubbles are still present.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, this is a thick,
this is a thick patty and it is still
[SPEAKER_07]: very, very clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could easily be twice the size that it
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, easily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the consistencies in the textures.
[SPEAKER_11]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's, uh, I'm actually going to
just smoke what's on the backend of this
[SPEAKER_11]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's just, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do half of that, you'll be
pretty stoked, but I'm in, I'll,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, I'll root you on for doing it all
while I load up some sensations,
[SPEAKER_07]: blood, orange, Italian soda.
[SPEAKER_07]: Delicious, delicious, fuzzy, fizzy bubbly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want some fizzy bubbly?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'd love some.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you some fizzy bubbly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just watched the Zohar movie, Zohan movie
the other day with my, uh, son was
[SPEAKER_07]: hilarious as always.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I got to say that's actually
true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very true about that movie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jewish people run on hummus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hummus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you brush your teeth?
[SPEAKER_07]: With it though?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do nothing with it, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lubricant for sex.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, holla.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was too much to do it up both sides.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: The pink Bubba.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna try a little of this darker.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more than I need.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's quite a lot there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give you a little cleanup here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's really lovely is that we have
indeed decided to put the boat in the
[SPEAKER_07]: water.
[SPEAKER_07]: After this puff, we're probably going to
go down, attach it to the car,
[SPEAKER_07]: take it down and dump it into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then we're going to go meet some
friends out on the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe by Boyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll get them all the way over to
Boyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: The view though.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like looking at basically the island
that we're going to go visiting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just out over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is right over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should bring the FTK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a bucket and an OFZ.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give you a new taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: From the first press.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also very stable and very,
like clearly the nicer resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really stable on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one also feels pretty damn stable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure looks trippy with the parchment in
there, but you can see Snick's imprint
[SPEAKER_09]: from the parchment.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: 710 parchment for the winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shall we go get a nautical?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as you guys can see, we kind of
skipped a few components there and just
[SPEAKER_07]: ended up out on the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go and see the boys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't mentioned who we're seeing yet
and we're not going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got some glass on the boat with us
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely have some lovely rosin and
you can see it's just most definitely a
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful day coming from the village.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty excited actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a little bit running behind right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those guys have probably been waiting for
us for a while, but as Flav just
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned, they're probably just taking
dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you say, Brad?
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we do it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think that's definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's try this out.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: the real identity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that video where Bubble Man
just crashes into Cory's boat?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing!
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up boys?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got some ropeys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah boys!
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to sea, come to sea!
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how to turn it off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave, you're not in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Dave's in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, well we made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hooked up, and guess who it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Stratis and Cory in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: We weren't telling anyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me a five.
Don't leave me hanging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flab in the house, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did I leave you hanging?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going back to Dave here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not leaving Dave hanging.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we bumped into these guys here in
Hawket Bay, just off the coast here of
[SPEAKER_07]: Gambier Island, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You used to spend time here, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I lived here for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, one of my favorite spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it not feel different on Gambier
compared to... It's no man's land.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's no man's land for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't feel... There's a couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a road system here, and then
there's another road system on the other
[SPEAKER_06]: side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there is a road system on this side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Small ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: The original road system's on that side,
and then Furclone Plateau put another
[SPEAKER_07]: little small one from where all those
houses basically got brought onto the
[SPEAKER_07]: island.
[SPEAKER_06]: A good place to have a dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I've actually dirt biked on Gambier,
as well as the Sunshine Coast and all over
[SPEAKER_07]: these, even on Golan for that matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, yesterday, I was driving by
Cypress Mountain, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_07]: I should just go see what's going on up
there on my KTM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Booted up to the top, and I get to the
back, and I'm like... There's these rice
[SPEAKER_07]: rockets just racing, literally like,
wah, and peeling out having drag races up
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, damn, I don't think many of
the mountain people are paying attention,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I drove my bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: All up Cypress Mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I shredded the ride.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that I had a camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took a few shots, but yeah, there's
something to be said for being allowed to
[SPEAKER_07]: shred.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that mountain could be full of
bikes if they actually let people do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be something that I would come
and pay for, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to dab up... Of course,
Flav brought the sickness on the boat with
[SPEAKER_07]: us, and so we got the rosin that we
pressed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should show them some of that rosin we
made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cookie rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that big chunk of... Oh yeah,
it's thick.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's thick, so it's really thick.
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks super thick.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that up there?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's bubba pink.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is also... This one here is also
really thick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to dab it right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see someone in the... Is that the
dabber you got, by the way?
[SPEAKER_07]: I grabbed your dabber, but then I let the
Swiss Army grab it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me grab a dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab a dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to grab a dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Swiss Army knife's cool, but it's
just like we want to respect the Swiss
[SPEAKER_07]: Army knife, and get a proper dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need to torch and clean it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to mention that happened pretty darn
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just clean a bit, and you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is great sitting in Hawket.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're out of the film every time you lean
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, don't do that with your shirt,
please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ, Dave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ, Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys ever used to holding pipes
with your socks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always had rings on our socks in high
school.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always had some paper towels in me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty hippie West Coast kids,
eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a perfectly stabilized base.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it definitely didn't come out easy,
did it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Another boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: The abacadabba?
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants first?
[SPEAKER_11]: You.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go last.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Corre.
[SPEAKER_11]: My phone's dead, so if someone wants to
get their phone out to time us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I got one right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: 30 seconds would be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did just change everything,
and now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I left that timer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You made me in one of my other portable
cases.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, I just forget to take it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just sitting in my closet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's something that hasn't yet
to catch on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just have yet to catch on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's go.
[SPEAKER_11]: 40 seconds, eh?
[SPEAKER_11]: 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_11]: My buddy has a Android phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's got a little timer on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's programmed it to say dab now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you don't have to press anything to
disband it.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll have to start the timer.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the timer says when it hits
zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not in the video just to light you
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good in two, one, and good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like if a flab moves away from the
picture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he really even there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he still there?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just something that we always need
to figure out, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pat's next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tasty?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it tastes better because A,
we're floating on a boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: It always tastes better out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like the first time we've done
it, which is kind of like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've got to do this on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get like a gymbal pipe stand
or something for the waves.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the pipe just doesn't move at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're always thinking like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really good though.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like a solid base.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a creative one, this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, it's the equivalent of taking
something and moving with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you do something that's kind of
like, okay, it might not be the most
[SPEAKER_07]: convenient or maybe it's, but it leads you
to the next stage, to the next stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's interesting because I saw D-Rack
talking the other day and how he's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready to be someone's apprentice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to step past my marble implosions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been doing these marble implosions
for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great, but it's like, that next
step needs to be taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've watched you do that with those little
marbles that spin and the little
[SPEAKER_07]: trichomes, pieces that you created to
create stands and it's pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_07]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely a good thing to- I enjoy
doing it in steps like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just push the envelope each time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you want me to hit that timer for
you?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're in a cold wind.
[SPEAKER_11]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're in a cold wind outside,
all very true.
[SPEAKER_07]: But worst case scenario, you get a tasty,
tasty little test.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we go back and give you another
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you really want to get it right,
what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was just too hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, do what you want to do, but don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you're not supposed to do.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things a chugger too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like, first of all, that
someone's handing you like a tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's weighty.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of boro in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even space rocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And space rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And space rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been heated up from a meteorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have chunks of meteorite and it
looks quite different from moldavite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moldavite's like when a meteor just smokes
this sandy beach and it just like melts
[SPEAKER_07]: the sand into that crazy, like,
it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely couldn't happen without
the meteor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The meteor is definitely important in that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You
[SPEAKER_06]: guys ever use tectonite in any of your
pieces?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really use moldavite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because both can be used with boro.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be so sad.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at 40 seconds.
All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do this here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So was that the first one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the Cookie Roslin?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: The phone just never asked for you.
No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten seconds and you're good.
I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny how there's a certain etiquette now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, before it'd be like,
heat up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's like, oh, 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you suck.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always been funny etiquette
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: People, I remember like, everyone's
calling first, second, third.
[SPEAKER_06]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've written rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: Left hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right hand rule.
[SPEAKER_10]: When who rules, it gets the first toke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never want the first toke because
the first toke's not on the paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you get to light it properly and
ensure that it burns down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad people stopped baptizing joints
because that was always pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was gross.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the worst out of all the things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, someone just spat on my joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Timer done.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the timer bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Timer bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did it take you to boat here?
[SPEAKER_06]: From where you docked to Whines Bay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, like to here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Under 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Under 10 minutes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: On a flat day, 14 minutes to West Bay
dock.
[SPEAKER_07]: On a bad, like, worst day, like maybe a
little worse than this, maybe a half an
[SPEAKER_07]: hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too, too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's way faster than mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That takes me like an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get from Gambier dock to Horseshoe Bay
dock in about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fast enough.
Yeah.
Not too bad at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sailed from Gypsum to like that point
the other day and back.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like three and a half,
four hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's sailing too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although how worried are you paying
attention to what's in front of you at all
[SPEAKER_07]: times?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I watch it for a bit,
but you're also not going very fast and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in a really thick old boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just going to push it out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You definitely shouldn't be hitting them.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's ideal not to hit them in your
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your dad?
[SPEAKER_07]: We went around one whole time already?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the way to do it, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me and Mark went out last summer and just
like booted around here and then over to
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, I think we went.
[SPEAKER_07]: My go-to spot really is Boyer just because
it's quiet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been to the Rock Island?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always seals all around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went this morning with the family
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to call it Seal Rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I used to call it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other one's the Coomeran Rock
by Davis Bay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw probably like 20 or 40 to 60 sea
lions there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, sea lions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those are huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: All barking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only ever seen one in the house down
and it was on my kayak about like 10 feet
[SPEAKER_07]: away and it frightened me.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so big, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: My boy had his legs hanging off the front.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going over the waves and two of
them came right up and they're like a foot
[SPEAKER_07]: or two from his feet and they just looked
and then they both like jetted in opposite
[SPEAKER_07]: directions.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so big.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like shitting his pants or shitting
their pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just not scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like super huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're close to them, like I came
around a corner on a kayak.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kayaking with a friend and he was
like, you're about to come face to face
[SPEAKER_07]: with a giant sea lion.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're big.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm paddling and I'm like,
it's probably a seal, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have sea lions in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went around this corner and this
thing, it must be like, I'm guessing 2000
[SPEAKER_07]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're big, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a frighteningly big, Dave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I basically felt like if it just
rolled off the rock, I would have been
[SPEAKER_07]: dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny because we started the one side
and there's nothing but seals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're watching them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're small.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not even moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just like chilling.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're little babies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we get around a corner and
there's that one spot and it's all sea
[SPEAKER_07]: lions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as soon as they see us, there's so
much aggression.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the big ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm biting like other ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was just like, can you imagine
being a seal in a sea lion's ocean?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a big one that happens down off
the coast of Tofino when you travel from
[SPEAKER_07]: like Mirror Island to like Secret Cove or
whatever it is, the natural hot springs
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a big rock that if you go by
plane, it's unreal how many sea lions fit
[SPEAKER_07]: on this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a flat rock that just barely
sticks out in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: This morning, I've probably seen like 300
seals on that one rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there has probably been like 60
sea lions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, you know, it's exciting to see like
some of these things, I swear,
[SPEAKER_07]: when people know the joke about,
have you done it on weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you looked at stars?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you looked at stars on weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's kind of like there are certain
things that you do in life that stimulate
[SPEAKER_07]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's certain foods that you can eat
that stimulate the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta think that that's kind of like
probably what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just those sites that stimulate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: You end up doing this really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like snowboarding is cool,
but have you done it on weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen a 300 seal on weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you all are.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a memorable morning, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like the best morning I've had in a
couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're followed by this sash on
the ocean, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get better than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make it better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smoking DMT on the beach tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, did you bring some?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh man, I left it at home.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking about bringing some because
I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my cousin for the first time and his
wife for the first time when we went to
[SPEAKER_07]: Thormenby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like late at night campfire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they got their first DMT experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty magical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is magical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's unfortunate that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: the first time I've ever been to
Thormenby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's uplifting moments, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: People put up a tent over there,
like seeing demons and talking to the
[SPEAKER_06]: devil.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're terrified of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're humbling to the ego.
[SPEAKER_07]: I myself have had humbling psychedelic
experiences.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not what I would call a bad trip,
but what I would call extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: educational and intensely intimate and
spiritual.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a way that's much more spiritual in the
way that religion was trying to jam it
[SPEAKER_07]: down my throat when I was young being
raised Catholic and going to Sunday
[SPEAKER_07]: school.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just kind of like, this does not
feel like the right thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you feel it in your whole body.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not feeling psychedelic in that
way for that reason, I think you're going
[SPEAKER_11]: about it wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, a lot of the kids nowadays,
not kids like we're fucking young people
[SPEAKER_11]: too, but a lot of the people, I'd go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: But man, it's like I sit there and they
K-hole for fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have to say that before I did it
as an educational tool, before I learned
[SPEAKER_07]: about Terrence McKenna and stuff,
I was also doing it for fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would only not knock doing it for
fun, in the beginning at least,
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's a great way to get your foot
in the door.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not knocking doing it for fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm knocking getting like totally like
a... No, I hear what you're saying,
totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Taking it too far that's not for some form
of interpersonal perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I stated early on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was to go on and on and on like
that, it ends up being well, hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone's different, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard to judge anyone on their
psychedelic use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally, at one point in time,
was doing mushrooms like four or five
[SPEAKER_07]: times a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing my own mushrooms that I ordered
for Terrence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they grew everywhere around here
growing up too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we were all picking them and
skateboarding around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I learned, we used to come from
Manitoba to pick mushrooms in BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, to give you an idea of how
special it was to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had patches like across from my high
school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we may have had that in Ontario,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up finding the largest patch of
mushrooms ever that I ever found.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Cyanessens and they were in the
multiple pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like probably 10 to 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say probably because someone else
got them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how we found them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a grow house that my partner and I
had on Mount Seymour Parkway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on the river.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: 15 or 20 lighter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day when that was kind of
serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one day we see this dready guy out in
our front yard just picking mushrooms like
[SPEAKER_07]: a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my buddy goes out and kicks him out
and he's like, dude, you gotta come over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he shows me this mushroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, this guy made...
[SPEAKER_07]: These are valuable, he says to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, well, they could be
psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get my book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I pulled out Paul Stamman's
Psychedelic Mushrooms around, psilocybin
[SPEAKER_07]: mushrooms around the world and identified
it as a Cyanesson.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were still like maybe three or
four pounds left, but this guy had taken
[SPEAKER_07]: at least 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an incredible patch.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the one happy motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the one happy French Canadian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very happy motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't have to work hard, didn't have to
go far.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen another harvest like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found many patches.
[SPEAKER_07]: But nothing major.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feeling iry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feeling iry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's windy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hit it hot, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so lovely out on the house out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many good nooks and crannies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one bummer about my boat having
fins underneath it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three big shark fins in the middle
of the boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't just beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: How far down?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're right at the bottom of the
boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: How deep do they go?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long do they go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not about that long.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're brass, just like my prop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything touches them when they're
bending.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is better than bending your... My
boat's good for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just pull up any beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: My buddy had one just like this and he
could do it because he didn't have those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done it just to the nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a drop off, I can kind of pull in.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing I had when the tide went down,
it was beached.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would cry if my boat was beached.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be just crying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wind's not knocking my boat all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's just sitting top.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sandy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sandy beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sitting in sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else is up.
[SPEAKER_07]: My motor's off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing's damaged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: One night it was so windy the tent was
like... The only thing holding it down was
[SPEAKER_07]: my buoy inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look at my boat, my boat's
just... I had it on savory like that one
[SPEAKER_07]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tied it to a buoy and then I watched it
almost the whole night because it was
[SPEAKER_07]: so...
[SPEAKER_07]: The storm was so violent.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next day it was like there were boats
on the shore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I hope my boat doesn't sink.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope my boat doesn't sink.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I woke up and I saw my boat just on
shore and I was like peaceful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: My boat's safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go back to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: My boat is safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a text data last year from the party
that's up there in the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good old party.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, except it's super close.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no bay at all in this bad storm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not with the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not with the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hanging out on the walls like,
holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or take my card.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's terrifying, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year was terrifying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fred Beard said he's got tickets for all
the last loaders.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just came back from a big trip and it's
double ferry to the... Do you guys know
[SPEAKER_11]: who the acts are?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's the acts?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sublime?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sublime?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: The sheep guards.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sublime like the new series.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard they're decent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And where's this at?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_06]: The... Biocap?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Legends Music Festival.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez, it might be... Maybe I'll go visit
it just as a person.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to always work everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, you should go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, yeah, I'm going to get a booth
and work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stand and be like... I'm just going
there to hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too, if I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our company's going to be there,
but I will not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not bringing much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to camp.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a fantasy football draft.
[SPEAKER_07]: Priorities, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Priorities, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantasy football drafts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Priorities.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very iry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready to get pulled soon or what?
[SPEAKER_07]: On the wake skate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulled on the wake skate?
[SPEAKER_07]: One more dab, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is the next stuff, and this is
other rosins.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the stuff that we made today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost want to take my bimini down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's windy enough, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not cold.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not in the sun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to skip too, and then you
could go surfing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll pick it up in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of orcas might be top off,
cherry on the top of the day, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Some orcas or some corpuses coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a couple orcas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a giant blue whale or something just
coming out of the water right behind him
[SPEAKER_07]: as he takes that dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like flying out of the water,
smashing.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 million hits on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: Killer whale dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you didn't see the killer whale dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you should check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 12 million people have seen it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How was that?
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: When should I give this a go?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_08]: See if I can get myself into the sun here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite a champion little chugger right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, these guys are finishing
it off with a dube, and I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: until next time, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great hooking up with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: With you guys on the water, I'll take Flav
back to my side so he can ferry back over,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you guys can head back on the boat,
and we'll definitely make this a more
[SPEAKER_07]: often experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time, we'll bring the electric nails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring some lunch, maybe go up and drop the
crab traps, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then pick them up and beat up and have
a little crab cook on the boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until then.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the food from a man planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation way of watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me eight full weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full strain with the rain, full coloring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Original,
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous, vegan, just can't stop me.
See you guys later.
