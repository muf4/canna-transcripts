[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're here in Ontario at Weed MD,
one of the future licensed production
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to take you in here and
give you a little show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take us in, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are at the vault, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pounds and pounds of wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the vault.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, these guys are not messing
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a two foot thick plus concrete.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Health Canada is not joking around
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want level nine to level 10 security,
which down in the U.S., I think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: like NASA and Pentagon style.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing is tied in with cameras.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see a camera up in the corner
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Health Canada has access to all
the cameras of all the facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this facility is just being built.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's not finished yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the middle of acquiring their
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the building is 25,000 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to do a little bit
more of a walk through.
[SPEAKER_04]: This machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they have to get rid of all
their like trim and stock and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: little extra herbs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go into here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This bin over here is going to be a
manure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to mix in with the material
that they, that they ruin so it can't be
[SPEAKER_04]: processed or cleaned any further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to take what they call waste
that is actually medicine and mix it with
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's Health Canada's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can grind it up and feed it
back to our plants, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a pretty big, serious unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a big, deep grinder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's big grinder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this vault.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chlorine, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to use organics, you don't
want chlorine in your water will kill your
[SPEAKER_05]: organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two carbon filters to take care of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing that's going to be added
is to UV lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those were great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Mario was talking about this
damatex control system and he was,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, there he is right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about this thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can really control things on a
different level with a system like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can adjust your dosing,
whatever PPM you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can lower your HP to your desired
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: The system then injects fresh filtered
water through a spinning system that mixes
[SPEAKER_05]: all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once all the nutrients are mixed,
sends it over to the water room.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the water room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about standardized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to get... Well,
you're getting the science down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's done with computers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting the precise feeding programs
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's really changing too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is, if you just monitor it,
there's not people coming in here with
[SPEAKER_02]: gauges and sticks and kind of winging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a computer system in the office
and what it does is it monitors all the
[SPEAKER_05]: levels at all times.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you change anything in your feeding
cycle and you get good results,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go back and say, okay,
this is when we did this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows you, okay, now it's easy to
reproduce the same effect because you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see where the changes are taking place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It logs everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what we're talking about
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're here explaining to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the other good thing is you save
countless of hours of watering everything
[SPEAKER_05]: by hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, that's completely ridiculous to
try and water that by hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nice thing about the system is if you
need to water by hand for any reason,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just a matter of switching a valve
and you're off to manual watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you show us where this is going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess this is still under
construction here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that power box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they definitely have some power.
[SPEAKER_05]: Power here to power approximately 10,000
lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10,000 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's an electrical room.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even an electrical room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so now we have a whole bunch of
stuff going on in here we're going to need
[SPEAKER_04]: explained.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're building here a mother room
on the right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we build out phase number two,
there's going to be two floors here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to double up on space.
[SPEAKER_05]: This section here will be the bedroom for
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the front corner, we're going to put a
little clothing in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, this facility is only half
built.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of things we still need
to implement in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all part of your cooling system
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was telling me a little bit about this
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, these are the chiller systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole system is cooled by glycol,
and it's 30% more efficient than your
[SPEAKER_05]: standard gas heat, I mean electrical air
conditioning system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who you guys had these guys come up
from Colorado to set this up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was the Hydro Innovations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hydro Innovations, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a closed-loop system that
operates and pumps into both rooms from
[SPEAKER_04]: your tanks?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess we'll head into the...
Security, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any room with any growing activity is
secured on both sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two security.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use the code, plus you have to
use a key card to get into each room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, each key card is
monitored by the person who owns that key
[SPEAKER_04]: card?
[SPEAKER_00]: The key card is... So it's all computer
monitored, and it's all registered to the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you who's been in and who's been
out of what rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time has been spent in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, by Health Canada standards,
there has to be a responsible person in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, and that's one of the challenging
things in our system is that not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the facility will be a
responsible person, because the clearance
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement is really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All different, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way this works is the responsible
person in charge can key in, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: people can follow them in, because it
knows that there's a responsible person in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, if the responsible person keys
out, he'll clear the room, and then nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: can key in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when someone told me they'd move...
That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ducks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like ducks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ducks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know, but ducks move in packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I was just looking here,
here's this dynamic control system we were
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another box here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this just like a relay box,
or how is this working here?
[SPEAKER_04]: The computer for the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: The computer for the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: This secret board here will initiate the
electronic irrigation system that is
[SPEAKER_05]: connected to the Aquamat system,
and basically we have these moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want you to tell us a bit about
these Aquamats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Aquamats are a very good way to
save a lot of water, and also save a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of time having to...
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm disabled, and I did this myself,
and this thing is what, 40 feet long?
[SPEAKER_03]: It weighs thousands of pounds?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 72 feet long.
[SPEAKER_05]: 22 feet long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can literally move it with... A couple
fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it went to the wrong side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty pimpin'.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these mats feed based on these sensors,
where the pots are sitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sensor will tell you at...
[SPEAKER_05]: At any given time what the moisture level
is inside the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can then choose when you'd like to
initiate the watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell the computer, and every time the
soil reaches a certain moisture,
[SPEAKER_05]: the computer will then automatically do
the watering for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no drip emitter system.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pushed up through... Yes,
this is done through a capillary action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's a membrane system that's
feeding actually through the mat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a special layer on top so
the roots cannot penetrate, and there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: special layer on the bottom that will only
allow the water to go through once there's
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure applied to the mat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another note about the water is that it's
actually dosed where the tanks are where
[SPEAKER_00]: we were earlier, and so that's where it's
fed from, and it's automatically dosed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's premixed through these mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the valves are coming through the
rim and all the different... So here's a
[SPEAKER_04]: question in regards to feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're feeding a food through the
mats, do you think that the mats
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves will require flushing of salts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's two ways you can flush the mat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's using water with hydrogen peroxide,
or you can just use regular water and pH
[SPEAKER_05]: down to 4.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: 4.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: To knock everything out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really cool technology,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys got about a hundred lights in
here?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 102 lights, and there's another
additional 50 lights that will be
[SPEAKER_05]: installed in between these lights to
illumine the sides of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are your closed system air
conditioners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all a glyco-cooled system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These coolers?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, these chillers?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're down to check it out, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see there's a lot of work that
goes into this for you people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not something that you just go out
on on a whim.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very intense, large project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the condensers that are
feeding the chillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll do it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the water tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the glycol tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glycol tanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the glycol tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back end, feed all the tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not an enormous amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'd think for the size of the system
that it could end up being a huge piping,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that, like eight inch?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's eight inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to install that in your tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did, didn't we?
[SPEAKER_04]: These big pumps for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so did you guys have a special company
that come in and do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did you guys just do it yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is all hydro-innovation from
Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came and did it all, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: They came and did it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's go ahead and turn this stuff on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, hit the switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are serious valves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one, two, three before the axis
can came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Johnny, look at the T.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We nerd out on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thanks for taking us through a little
walkthrough, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed MD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch for him.
See you next time.
