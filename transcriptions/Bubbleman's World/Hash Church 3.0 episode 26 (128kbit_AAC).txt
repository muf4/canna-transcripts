[SPEAKER_10]: forward onto this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll do some YouTube action here
real quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, Etienne and Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hellody, hellody, hellody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just getting or going on YouTube real
quick here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of caught up with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in the chat chatting away with
everyone and all of a sudden I was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh, shit, it's nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_10]: Should probably go live.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, my internet is unstable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to have an unstable internet
connection to stream, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you're not on the internet.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a series of tubes, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are live.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to share this new link with
the folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be great if that would close.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about this, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I'm a little bit more organized.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard about this new link.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same as the old link.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't be fooled again.
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't be fooled again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks, last minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to have a few of you guys in the
room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Colin's going to show up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny B said he might show up and Mark
Sheldon might show up as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what do you got there, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it looks like some terpy goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like some honey oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: One gram of D9THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: THCP, it said.
[SPEAKER_10]: THCP.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I saw a P on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Sam, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sam, what's the high on that sucker?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's strong as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong as fuck, ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here first on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong as fuck is Skunk Man Sam's THCP.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you taking like a micro pin tip
head of that or how are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a couple of regular size dabs of it
and it was a bit, you know, creeper at
[SPEAKER_06]: first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I smoked the third one,
I smoked half rosin and half THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about the time I finished that one,
I was getting pretty hammered from the
[SPEAKER_06]: first two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, before long, I couldn't walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally lost the motor functions in your
legs or you just fell?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I could walk, but I had to hold on to
the walls and I felt like I was doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: shimmy shake as I did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What it kind of reminds me of is if you
eat a lot of THC and it goes through the
[SPEAKER_06]: liver pass, first liver pass, and then you
end up with 11 hydroxy, it reminded me
[SPEAKER_06]: almost more of 11 hydroxy than THC because
I smoked, I vaped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long did it last?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the onset?
[SPEAKER_05]: How long was the onset?
[SPEAKER_06]: It lasted quite a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had long duration, very long duration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us any type of an hour,
two hours, 15 minutes, no time
[SPEAKER_05]: designation?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I was too fucking high,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think enough people understand how
ridiculous that is, what you just said.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fucking high.
[SPEAKER_10]: When's the last time you were too fucking
high when you ate like a hundred hits of
[SPEAKER_06]: acid?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not very recently, but if you try hard
enough, sooner or later, you do succeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ain't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll say that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even for myself, who I don't claim to have
the same level of tolerance as you,
[SPEAKER_10]: I can puff pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But every once in a while, I surprise
myself and I just find myself like,
[SPEAKER_10]: I destroyed myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can remember it legends where we would
get so fucking high on that Afghan hubbly
[SPEAKER_06]: bubbly smoking, full melt, clear dome,
but I could still walk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could still walk.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only time my walking was ever affected
was the first time I ever smoked at your
[SPEAKER_10]: house.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could still walk, although it was a
lot like John Cleese and the funny walk
[SPEAKER_10]: Monty Python clip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was still doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not being able to walk is a serious level
of highness that I think I've only really
[SPEAKER_10]: experienced on psychedelics or maybe
eating large doses.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I've seen it more is when you orally
eat several grams of THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will get you to that point also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So was it an immediate peak?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it come on gradually when you came
down?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a come down gradually?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more of a creeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure about when it actually
left because I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: By then I was smoking hits that was half
THC and half THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: And but it was high enough that the next
day I didn't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Try it to also gauge her or just you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried everything I could to persuade her
to take it, but she was too smart for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: He knows you like the back of her hand,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to persuade her to get
lit on THCP.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll come over and hit some.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to say she's not, you know,
I'm more than happy to volunteer myself
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only scientific experimentation,
ladies and gentlemen, strictly.
[SPEAKER_06]: An interesting way to try it might be
because it has no terpenes and it has no
[SPEAKER_06]: other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty, you know, it doesn't have
individuality, you know, the way we enjoy
[SPEAKER_06]: with cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, let's say you were going
to roll a joint and you smeared some of
[SPEAKER_06]: this on a cigarette paper before you
rolled it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you anything that would instantly
make the strongest joint you've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would taste good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like do like a thin line with a
pen on the paper or would you just spot
[SPEAKER_05]: dab it on the paper?
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever somebody enjoys doing is what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a thin line would actually work,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never smoke marijuana, as you know,
so that I'm merely speaking theoretically
[SPEAKER_06]: here, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Theoretically, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I've been waiting to hear
someone puffing on this THCP for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Sam, it's not the stuff you want to be
taken to concerts and putting in joints
[SPEAKER_10]: and passing over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, because I think if you
passed it to somebody who is an naive
[SPEAKER_06]: user, it might be too much for,
you know, it'll give them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a bad trip on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be like just a straight THC
high, just constant, consistent elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you said, since it was a creeper,
that would definitely be something not
[SPEAKER_05]: comfortable for a neophyte user for sure,
because they want to feel they've arrived
[SPEAKER_05]: at an area.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that I've been around that I've
gotten too high that was there and the
[SPEAKER_05]: explanation was like, I keep getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep getting higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't stop getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see it even more commonly with oral
when people eat hash cookies and they eat
[SPEAKER_06]: one or two and they're not getting that
zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they eat a couple more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the first ones start coming on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then time stops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm going to have a dab all this
talk and dab and I got a little grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't know how THC is created.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, is there a THCP synthase?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a different feedstock that's going
in?
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore the THC is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, if you look at the CBD
synthase, it produces CBD, but it also
[SPEAKER_06]: produces about a 20 to one ratio of THC
along with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe this is also being produced by
one of the other synthases.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you extract?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a particular genetic you
extracted this from or is this just a
[SPEAKER_05]: culmination of things that you extracted?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll explain that to you later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to do it in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you kindly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You Mr. Scientist, good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the last time I was too high was
when I spent time with you, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_11]: in Amsterdam and we were puffing super
heavy with some of summer's flower and
[SPEAKER_11]: then some hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember walking around in Amsterdam
in a circle and then finally walking past
[SPEAKER_11]: the group that was in with us and they're
like, Colin, I'm like, hey, they're like,
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to go home.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, dude, you left like two
hours ago to go home.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just like walking in the circle
and I just until they said something to
[SPEAKER_11]: me, it didn't even register.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just like five and enjoying the city
and enjoying night.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, one of the highest like 10 years
ago, 12, 15, maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the highest I remember was actually
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Amsterdam visiting positronics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were visiting with old Ed and Bernard
was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Todd was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what?
[SPEAKER_05]: 96.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you walked in with this black glass
chunk, Sam, and you clicked off a piece
[SPEAKER_05]: and the sound of the click made me go,
what the hell?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you passed it to Ed and Ed packed a
pipe and passed it around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my eyes rolled back in the back of my
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing I know, I was standing over
by, remember the mother plants with the
[SPEAKER_05]: George Washington pick inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was standing there and my wife came over
to me and was like, Etienne, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't know where I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the earliest,
most highest I've ever been credit Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say I'm not guilty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You technically were.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were completely not guilty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one who inhaled it and put it into
my lungs.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing I know, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it was completely my fault,
but thank you for assisting in my
[SPEAKER_05]: faultness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, are you putting it straight onto
flower or are you just dabbing it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting it right into a, a,
one of, you know, this pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drizzler.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they call it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nate Dizzle is the, is the guy I said the
Drizzler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: With LPR, you fucking THC peer.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, that's like, when I talk to
my friends, I'm like, it's trichomes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I said trichomes.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trichomes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I said it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I catch that all the time from people.
[SPEAKER_10]: What strand is that trichomes?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But how much trichomes have the CBDs?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many CBDs are in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: None.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero in the, in the THCP.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent a quick message.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, it's 99.4% THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so it's full of contaminants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of Judas Priest
and a little bit of Iron Maiden in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you guys puffing on?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm puffing on Johnny B's Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little full mouth that he gifted me some
90 micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very melty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm puffing on some creme brulee from Papa
in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice color.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a little New York City garlic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I left this out last night.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it got a little, you know, starting to
go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit, but it looks nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the THCP.
[SPEAKER_11]: That shit looks nuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks really nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: How much is that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is that just one gram?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gram and it's like really thick
honey oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, if you tilt it,
it will eventually almost pour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hella sticky, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sticky as fuck, but it's,
you know, a little bit more liquidy than
[SPEAKER_06]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you experimented with evaporation
temperatures?
[SPEAKER_05]: When does it tend to evaporate?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know any of that kind of shit
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: My shit's hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing I know, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went right to the, you know,
the core of the issue, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what is it like compared to pure
THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm experienced with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it leaves THC in the dust.
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you like that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you like my new best friend when you
took a couple of puffs?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really like THC with the right
suite of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is my creme de la creme.
[SPEAKER_11]: So is THCP, Sam, is it an effect that is
immediate or is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not immediate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a creeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a creeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even with the terps added or was this when
you just hit it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm talking about without the terps,
just the THCP itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Dr. Mark is trying to get in right now
and it's given him some weird baloney
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if he can't get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, while waiting and always fun to do
it, a interaction part that's fun on
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube is let's ask everybody who's
watching us, what are they smoking?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, what we could do is we could
play a different game.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called, let's guess what Dr. Mark is
going to say to me as soon as he comes
[SPEAKER_06]: online.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to say that there's lots of
people who say, who sell THCP in America,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's all Delta nine, Delta eight THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, they just didn't clean up
their THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here he is.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, Doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Howdy, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: I already told him everything you're going
to say, so you can just save your breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Delta eight or is it Delta nine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Delta eight and a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I also got Delta eight THCP from
the same folks.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear Kevin Sabet now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making a new marijuana crack
called THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should tell him it's THCP and that way
he'll go on telling everybody whatever you
[SPEAKER_06]: do, don't smoke the THCP.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't touch the peepee.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see it, Mark, or hear anything
that was discussed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is synthetic, right, Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew he was going to go for that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made synthetically.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you compare it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually made from a natural material
bios, but it's synthesized from that,
[SPEAKER_06]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everything must be made from a
natural material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless we're importing feedstocks from
Mars, everything comes from Earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Even stuff from Earth came from space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, even the stuff from Earth came from
other stars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where does that end?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, why does it end at Mars?
[SPEAKER_10]: Nature isn't on Mars.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, yeah, fuck Mercury and Venus,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there life on Mars?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Mr. Bowie.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would know by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's synthetic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means it's made by a chemist in a
laboratory, not by a producer of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated plant at a grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a different kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was first isolated from a plant by the
Italians.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the yield in a plant is 0.0001.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not practical to extract it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably for good reason, if it's as
strong as you say it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I hung up here?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we could hear you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just a little tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: My back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only there in a trace amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, could this be one of the
things that leads to the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's in trace amounts,
but 30 times more active?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be part of the cannabinoid soup
that makes things more active as an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract versus the natural cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: PHCP has not been found in all that many
varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't suspect that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's like a proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps it's part of that uncharacterized
fraction of what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that there's analytical standards
for it, we could actually find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that it hasn't been
there all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the cannabinoid with the C7
side chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THC has got a C5 side chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The C3s are the varins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would only go to show that there's a
distribution of all of those chain lengths
[SPEAKER_01]: in the molecule from C1 all the way up to
maybe even C11 and higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are going to be higher molecular
weight, but they're all going to have kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like the same cannabinoid structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to have different
tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the thing that I've wondered
is, again, the group that looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: making, you know those compounds,
Sam, with the two methyl groups next to
[SPEAKER_01]: the benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's thought of that that methylene
that's next to the benzene ring is an
[SPEAKER_01]: active site for oxidation in the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they did is they put two methyl
groups there to block it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a bunch of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the JW compounds or maybe they
were HU compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: HU compounds made at Hebrew University
that were C7, but they had two extra
[SPEAKER_01]: methyl groups right next to the benzene
ring to block metabolic oxidation at that
[SPEAKER_01]: benzylic position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always thought that that was
interesting that this is just sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the linear version of a C7 versus kind of
like C7 in a sort of different isomeric
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the other thing that you have to
think about is, again, the enantiomeric
[SPEAKER_01]: purity of the starting material terpene
that you're using with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that you make these compounds
is you react something called PM diol
[SPEAKER_01]: under acidic conditions with the
dihydroxybenzene derivative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be a dihydroxybenzene with
the C7 substituent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a difficult reaction and it's
difficult to make that diol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that what you're smoking here
comes from the laboratory of experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: chemists, because not only to make that
reaction work well so the product is
[SPEAKER_01]: clean, the starting material is a little
bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just snap your fingers and get
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do derive it from limonene,
but it's a diol that's derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene and it uses some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's an oxidation in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's peracetic acid or
hydrogen peroxide, but something that can
[SPEAKER_01]: go boom in that crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I tried to get this a couple of
months ago, I couldn't because they hadn't
[SPEAKER_06]: yet successfully separated the THCP from
the Delta 9 from the Delta 8 THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they have successfully separated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically what you're saying,
ladies and gentlemen, is you're hearing
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mark tell you is don't try this at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who are making this are in
pharmaceutical laboratories doing
[SPEAKER_01]: preparative chromatographic separations
that you need $100,000 equipment and
[SPEAKER_01]: really highly trained staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just imagine because I know the
people that are over there across the pond
[SPEAKER_01]: who Sam's getting this from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope again and yeah, there's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to remember too that it was a
couple of months ago, Max Monrose said he
[SPEAKER_06]: had THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, vaguely.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_06]: He never showed up with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he never did.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time, you, Mark, were worried about
whether or not it was truly THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you wanted to analyze it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was in favor of you doing that
because I was skeptical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Mark, that's the first THCP I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've only heard it as a mythical
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I've actually seen the unicorn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it was terpene rich with the right
terpenes that you like, I bet you would be
[SPEAKER_03]: unbelievably wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC mixed with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me tell you, you don't want to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to smoke the THC with the
terpenes in resin or something because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's way more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually less THC will get you higher
than pure THC of an equal weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was talking with Michael Baucus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was saying, or maybe I heard it
here, about how he was doing modulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was feeding people high THC early in
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And later on, he was feeding them low THC,
high terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were getting higher later in the
day because of the less THC because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: saturation in the CB1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just coming back behind it with
the terps, re-stimulated it, reactivated
[SPEAKER_05]: it, and re-elevated it higher than it was
prior.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm convinced that it was the terps that
enabled original haze of select cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no matter what time of the day you
smoked it, no matter what you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing, whether you've been up all day or
you've just woke up, you would get higher
[SPEAKER_06]: from one big hit on a bong of original
haze weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always got you higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_06]: On positive, that was strictly the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that at the gray area?
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to have the one bowl challenge
or the one hit challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that where you go?
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a tri-comb challenge,
but that was Adam.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Adam at THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he did that at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: He had the chair set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen some amazing ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually got some old ones from the
90s on video of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also made it almost impossible to
finish a tri-comb bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: He couldn't cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fucking enormous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was enormous.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he would hit it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember a couple years.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was out of a three-foot class bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a tall piece as well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got video of the tallest where he had
the big chair set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, you got to sit in the chair
because the pipe's like five or six feet
[SPEAKER_10]: long.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got all kinds of silly people to do
that from film porn stars to Woody
[SPEAKER_06]: Harrelson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really much difference between those
two.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Crazy Sean.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him do that to hundreds of people
and I did it once or twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the bowls were too big.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a big bowl, but not to the point
where it makes me uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually has fish on there doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think two or three of them did the
tri-comb challenge like when they went
[SPEAKER_10]: there in the late 90s or maybe early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: It failed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Failed hard, but it was a fun fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder why Johnny B never came in for a
visit.
[SPEAKER_10]: He took a nice day over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I one time took about a half ounce of dry
sift over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, Matt used to work with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knocked it over and it fell all over a
shag carpet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh dear God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why he moved away?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not why he moved away.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's why he should have moved away.
[SPEAKER_10]: He bounced to California to work with Jeff
at Aqua Labs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that where he ended up?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: If my memory serves me correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Jeff's probably watching.
[SPEAKER_10]: He can either correct me if I'm wrong or
confirm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hash bean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone's like, it reminds me of hash bean
doing gauntlets with one of the hundred
[SPEAKER_10]: glass bongs he has.
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy was nuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: The most impressive one I saw hash bean do
was where he built the little tent that he
[SPEAKER_10]: sat inside and he turned on his volcano
until you couldn't see him in this tent
[SPEAKER_10]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a clear tent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: Missed that guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always had a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he trying to imitate the Synthians?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I think he was.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know hash bean, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the kid that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ash Bean, he used to light bongs at the
legends.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sure did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, water pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hubbly bubblies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hubbly bubblies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hubbly bubblies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I tell you, those hubbly bubblies,
those are special.
[SPEAKER_10]: Legends needs to get some hubbly bubblies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're from Afghanistan,
if you have access to hubbly bubblies,
[SPEAKER_10]: Legends of Hash needs to have a couple of
its own hubbly bubblies for the ritual
[SPEAKER_10]: because wherever legends happens,
it needs to have that aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't think it would ever be the
same without that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, one year we even set up TVs with old
footage, someone's footage from the
[SPEAKER_10]: seventies of like puffing hubbly bubblies
in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_10]: So while we're in line in the restaurant
leading up to the hubbly bubbly on the
[SPEAKER_10]: TVs, there's like these dudes doing the
same thing just in Afghanistan puffing
[SPEAKER_10]: these hubbly bubblies.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a pretty, pretty, pretty
magical experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we should also do is maybe get some
sort of a laser sight so that we can see
[SPEAKER_06]: how high the flame shoots up after you
take a big draw.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does it shoot up one foot?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it shoot up two feet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it shoot up three feet, four inches?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: If Hash Bean was hitting it, it was going
to hit the full two plus feet,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I used to watch the flame from
the hubbly bubbly and try to estimate how
[SPEAKER_06]: many grams of hash was in that flame.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to keep up with the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also, I'm supposed to in the next
month or so get THC B, which is another
[SPEAKER_06]: isomer of THC, but it is weaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only supposed to be about 25% as
strong as THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC B?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, THC B as in baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: B as in baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, beta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the C6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also discovered by the Italian
group.
[SPEAKER_05]: That found the THCP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they even found the B first.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's to our Italian brethren.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Italians always popping up,
you know, like for a country that's been
[SPEAKER_10]: so harsh against herb for so long,
telling you it's not like the most herb
[SPEAKER_10]: friendly country, or at least it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but they always, they always had a
very large cannabis industry for hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the finest quality hemp in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after they sort of the industry
died down in Italy, the French sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: took it over, but they were really
producing seeds more than the French
[SPEAKER_06]: weren't mass producing fiber.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Italians that made that
Gardella machinery that was, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: it would take it straight off the,
the take off the core and you'd be left
[SPEAKER_05]: with wet green, uh, fiber hanging
straight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's pretty amazing stuff back in
this is the early to mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I don't even know if they're still
around, but they made some of the finest
[SPEAKER_05]: of corticators and because it was done wet
like that, they were able to immediately
[SPEAKER_05]: comb it and have a nice, uh, natural,
uh, delignated, you know, hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also had a better fine weaving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also had a better golden color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a better golden color when they
would, uh, then what we would get in,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Hungary and Romania and the Czech
Republic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause out there it's field redded and it
lays in the field and, uh, molds get on it
[SPEAKER_06]: and it turns gray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we actually, we actually water read
it ours, but yeah, it's a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Polish definitely came out grayer because
they were field grading it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just an actual bacteria eating
the lignin people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what kind of tends to cause it to
go that great color in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas we would take these large cement
baths and submerge our hemp in it so that
[SPEAKER_05]: the lignin and the natural bacteria would
eat at the lignin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you would able to just peel it
right off the core.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas that Gardella machinery did that
right out of the field, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: right into a truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it saved time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, just, just a minor hiccup there.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I got bounced and I'm recording it so
I can upload it to the podcast afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess now that I got bounced,
it'll be two separate episodes or at least
[SPEAKER_10]: part one and part two recording in
process.
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine hearing that 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, everybody would have shut it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be like, what happened to hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden this thing says recording
and everybody turned off and ran away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happened all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a debt show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I'll call you from a pay phone and
let you know what happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, that must've been what was keeping
Alice and John out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they just literally just came in at
that exact time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I think my computer was jacked
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here in a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to see you, Alice.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you all too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a question for Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: One question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does he feel there is one mother variety
to all cannabis or what is his view on how
[SPEAKER_10]: it evolved?
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel it was one very variety that
migrated from a central point myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where he says it originated in Tibet
3 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I honestly do not know because the
oldest cannabis remains they found are
[SPEAKER_06]: just tens of thousands of years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, it'll have any seeds or
pollen or fiber or stocks of flowers,
[SPEAKER_06]: anything that's older than tens of
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very curious and I can
speculate, but that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just speculation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us have speculated it possibly
goes back to Gondwana land when it was one
[SPEAKER_05]: land mass, but we can't find any,
you know, in certain, as you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: certain continents just never had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for example, there is no
cannabis remains in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Older than 500 years pre-Columbian there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no pollen, no seeds, no fiber,
no flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is none in the Americas,
North or South America.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, is this like John McPartland's
work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't he like John McPartland did the
Tibetan where he, he says that evidence
[SPEAKER_06]: steers him towards Tibetan Plateau.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three million years ago, but he does not
have any remains that are even 50,000
[SPEAKER_06]: years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no concrete proof.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like John a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like his work, but all it is,
is a theory at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that basically what we saw in Leiden
that he presented with all the pollen?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the same paper that where I asked
him some difficult questions afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically where he admitted that there
were no physical remains that were three
[SPEAKER_06]: million years old or even 30, even 50,000
years old in Tibet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mark, if you like to invite John onto
church, I'm working with him on a current
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in touch with him lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about that and just give him
some advanced notice because he does have
[SPEAKER_01]: a medical practice and is often committed
to seeing patients and more than an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well on Sunday, I'm sure he's not
seeing patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's try to set them up to come
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has been working on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been helping with the COVID doctoring
in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely pick you up on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awkward silence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to bounce here in just a
little bit because I got, we're on our way
[SPEAKER_01]: up to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feast of San Gennaro, which is one of
the great Italian festivals that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: in lower Manhattan is happening this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to go up there with my
daughter.
[SPEAKER_11]: So happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy past church.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a sausage, peppers, and onions
for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: To touch on is, um, that's kind of been on
my radar for the past few weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been, been working with Kevin
McKernan over medicinal genomics to
[SPEAKER_11]: identify certain plants that I was
recently, uh, we was just calling recently
[SPEAKER_11]: acquired from a clone provider that is a
well-known club clone provider.
[SPEAKER_11]: In another state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it should be known that we,
out of the 12 samples that we've sent in,
[SPEAKER_11]: eight of them hit hot for HLVD,
which would be hop late enviroids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are really well-known varieties
that a lot of people are growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know other people have these same
cuts from the same exact nursery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we're really trying,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, and, uh, agriculturists to,
uh, to really work together and bringing
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone's minds together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which to find a way to not only rid the
plan of this fry ride, but, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: to better understand how this is happening
and how it's being passed along.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we're in the midst of testing,
uh, you know, everything from water to see
[SPEAKER_11]: if it's carry, if, if water is a carrier,
let's say you're using a cloner and you're
[SPEAKER_11]: putting a clone in with other several
hundred other, other varietals,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you're looking to go into production
with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that being passed along?
[SPEAKER_11]: At what stage is it being passed along and
how to, uh, to essentially move forward
[SPEAKER_11]: and make the right choice to either send
it to, you know, through the right SOP or
[SPEAKER_11]: protocols to, you know, rid the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we don't have to start over and we
don't lose these amazing varieties that
[SPEAKER_11]: we've all kept for so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, because I think it's a big
conversation, um, that is a silent,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a silent killer due to a lot of
varieties and a lot of people that don't
[SPEAKER_11]: know they have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do simple things like,
uh, flame torch your cutting tools between
[SPEAKER_06]: every plant piece that you cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can use, instead of a big bucket
of water, you could use little tiny,
[SPEAKER_06]: tall, skinny pipettes of water for each
individual branch so that they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: cross contaminating each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's, you know, and also in the
same breath, you know, there were some
[SPEAKER_11]: things that were in a, in a cloner with
these other varieties, um, that did not
[SPEAKER_11]: test positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there, there's some things,
there's, there's a lot to understand here
[SPEAKER_11]: and there isn't any guidance really at
all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we, we really need to better
understand what, what's, what's happening,
[SPEAKER_11]: how this is happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and you know, I know that these clones
are in other people's hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I know other farms that are growing
these exact plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, they just don't know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's really have they, have they
expressed the problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's highly likely that it's really hard
to, to trigger these responses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think that things like Fusarium and
other things like that are, that are
[SPEAKER_11]: coming into play actually trigger the
plants immune response to, to show more of
[SPEAKER_11]: these traits.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I, I, again, these are
really, we're really far off in terms of
[SPEAKER_11]: factual evidence here, but we really need
to understand and have this dialogue
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's it's, that's alarming to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are, these are really well-known
varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to, I'm not even going to talk
about what varieties they are,
[SPEAKER_11]: but they are really well-known varieties
that a lot of people love and cherish.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and yeah, we just, we really need to
come together as a community and try to
[SPEAKER_11]: figure this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know there's, there's things like
chemotherapy, there's, there's light
[SPEAKER_11]: therapy, there's, there's some TC,
you know, that we can do, but again,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no real guidance as the community,
um, that I've seen to date, unless someone
[SPEAKER_11]: here on this panel, and that's why I'm
bringing it up, has any information to
[SPEAKER_11]: share?
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I know Kevin McKernan and myself are,
are really over this next week,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to be doing some, some other
types of tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm going to retest those same moms,
take cuts from different, uh, different
[SPEAKER_11]: parts of those plants and try to,
uh, zone the parts, zone the actual mom
[SPEAKER_11]: into specific zones.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can see if, if, Hey, maybe the,
you know, the left side of the plant,
[SPEAKER_11]: that wasn't infected, but the right side
was, you know, these are things that,
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's a virus, um, these are all
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, who's done a lot of work
with this is say grip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say they can successfully clean up
that virus from plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can identify it, then clean it up,
then guarantee it's eliminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a place here in Abbotsford,
and as we're talking about this,
[SPEAKER_07]: we have mother houses and places that I'm
in, in the midst of going through.
[SPEAKER_07]: A place was destroyed two days ago when
everything was tested positive for this
[SPEAKER_07]: virus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rapidly going through the West coast
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: These strains, um, you know what I want to
name, but I know the strains that are
[SPEAKER_07]: effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming up from the U S.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it houses up here, it's actually being
transported through thrips too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've got thrips in different bugs
and you've got the strain, you got a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem because it went through one
through through another through thrips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're having it tested here in the
Fraser Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually having my strain tested
because I actually have something that
[SPEAKER_07]: might've passed on to me, which I talked
to Mark the other day about talking with
[SPEAKER_07]: Cegra because this is a major problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's a major virus that's being
passed throughout the community and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: also coming in seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also coming from cutting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're passing, they're breathing with
it and these seeds are being popped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're seeing seeds being popped
that have no resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the midst of popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like right now, four weeks in three of
them are showing nothing but traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fourth one I took out of my room was
sitting outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like cabbage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be our cookies and cream
purple punch cross GMO.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I'm identifying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a, it is, it's real guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a, it's a, it's sanitizing
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have scissors attached to every mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll need that to that mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about water.
[SPEAKER_07]: We never talked about water.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a major, I'm looking at right now
because with the water staying the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I went through one place right now
and all seven ones went through,
[SPEAKER_07]: so it infected one mother house.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we've got a whole out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's kind of like freaking out
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you're talking about this, we're right
smack in the middle of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know of 27 viruses which attack
cannabis.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them, there are not negative
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, they can have the virus,
but they don't express any negative
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms, no economic vaccine.
Maybe.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the Delta nine vaccine.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say of these 27, about half of them
can be transmitted by clones, by seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: by pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once something spreads, it's a bitch to
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We, we tested for tobacco streak,
tobacco ring spot hops, mosaic,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, uh, arabist mosaic and cucumber mosaic
and none of those hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we did do a spread.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but like you, you know, someone
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the test, was the test that you used
specifically for cannabis or was it just a
[SPEAKER_06]: general test for the industry,
for the vegetable industry or something?
[SPEAKER_11]: So Kevin, I believe uses QPCR to do this
medicinal genomics carried out the
[SPEAKER_11]: testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I didn't personally do the testing,
but I contributed the samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Well, I'm, I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure
he's testing specifically for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The virus in general, because there are
test kits for the virus in general,
[SPEAKER_06]: which aren't as good when you test
cannabis with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would imagine Kevin's got,
I mean, his array and his lab is really
[SPEAKER_11]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: He has all the right instrumentation to
get the job done.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he has ample space there and a great
team.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, you know, and we're also going to
be sequencing all these varieties and
[SPEAKER_11]: sequencing the whole genome just because I
think.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be great to understand if,
if this is also affecting the genome and
[SPEAKER_11]: what type of expressions that are coming
off of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so it'd be really interesting just to
tie all these things together,
[SPEAKER_11]: have some dialogue, provide some guidance
for the community and better understand
[SPEAKER_11]: the things that we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it was extremely alarming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I called him immediately.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I started seeing these traits
from these new things that were sent to me
[SPEAKER_11]: or we acquired, I should say, um,
that that's on the negative side on the
[SPEAKER_06]: positive side is in the last three months,
they have published several papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is on several genes, which are
resistant to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one is a gene which shows
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have these genes, uh,
the resistant one is dominant,
[SPEAKER_06]: which meant even if you just had one copy
of it, it should, uh, confer a resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the, uh, I'm not sure about the,
uh, susceptibility one, whether or not it,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, is, uh, uh, dominant or, or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You bring that up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause there's exactly what Kevin and I
were talking about is like the gene
[SPEAKER_11]: response, you know, insert some of these
varieties, you know, some of them are
[SPEAKER_11]: getting PM that were quite frankly
resistant to them all along for,
[SPEAKER_11]: for, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I, I.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grunt some of these for, for around 10
years, and I'd never seen that type of
[SPEAKER_11]: response from these, these, these
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really all these things and all
this stuff is tied together.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do believe that we just, again,
we don't really know how, where it's where
[SPEAKER_11]: these things are crossing, you know,
touching each other and getting it,
[SPEAKER_11]: or it's, it is the scissors.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is an open wound or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so much to understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I just wanted to bring it up
because it does affect resin production.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does affect our, our ability to,
to, um, to work with these chemicals in
[SPEAKER_11]: post-processing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I just want to try to bring
it up and have good dialogue on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say there's lots of
information on it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hop, slain, viral.
[SPEAKER_07]: This morning shots, the Canadian cannabis
industry, some new websites coming out
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, how was infected, where it came
from out of California, the same money
[SPEAKER_07]: came from hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a lot of research on the papers
that you're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave you a friend yesterday,
but, um, definitely it's, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like it's after the market in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: They talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was first discovered by dark heart,
uh, nursery in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I had read about the exact same virus
in hop fields in Poland, uh, more than
[SPEAKER_06]: seven years earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's, that's where we got to really
trace it back to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting finding out more about this
disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we haven't really looking at it,
but, and like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_07]: it shows up on one side of the plant and
it's just like one size infected,
[SPEAKER_07]: but what we understand the whole,
it's kind of like it's in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the blood.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that one part is infected, the whole
plant's infected.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people been trying to
pass on cuttings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, can you take this cut and save it for
me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's how it really screwed this
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's what's been happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's been packing around those
macron cuts and all of these skittles and
[SPEAKER_07]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying these names because it's real
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: These strains have these, this,
this, this virus, they have the disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and it's being passed through,
like I said, through thrips, through
[SPEAKER_07]: cuttings, through pinching, you pinch one
strain, you go to another and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: passing that along.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dangerous as hell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is extremely, you guys got to really
pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have it, kill everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start from seed, go back to your old
seeds, wash a lot of new seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, that's what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds are not free of virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They outgrow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: In vitro and it grows, they take the tip
of the tip of the tip and it's grows
[SPEAKER_06]: faster than the virus spreads in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore you get, if you do that a few
times in a row, you get a clean piece
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for explaining that to me,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's, I was wondering how they
would do that, but that, that would
[SPEAKER_07]: explain it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's really cool to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome to Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wooksauce is also in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, started the morning off with Sam
holding up some THCP telling us it was so
[SPEAKER_10]: strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: He couldn't walk after he dabbed a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was an interesting start to the
day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably, probably not going to be getting
any THCP anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good with just the regular dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds intense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just regular dabs are strong enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine the booth at like a cannabis cup
and it just said, so you think you can dab
[SPEAKER_10]: and you just like, you just scooping out
big quarter gram dabs of the THCP for
[SPEAKER_10]: these young bucks that are like,
hell yeah, I can dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can dab like two grams at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the trouble is what's going to happen
to you 10, 15 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to get it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, I smoked two or three of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wham bam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, wasn't that impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I started feeling it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe they should pair up with a
mattress company.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then there's a couple of beds nearby.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a hammock company maybe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing, Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm really intrigued at Sam's experience
with THCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been reading about it for a while
now since it was found in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the first person I've
heard who actually consumed some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, Sam is well known for
enjoying heroic doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it actually like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, sorry for being late, but I'd love to
hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a day late, a dollar short.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Wade.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of reminded me more of 11 hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, if you eat a gram of THC,
you'll get very, very stoned from you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, like a hashish cookie that has a
gram of THC in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some people, that alone,
and if not a second gram for sir,
[SPEAKER_06]: will make it so that they can't really
walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get the staggers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not from the THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the first pass through the liver
and it comes out as 11 hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's actually giving you this
staggers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar to the effects of THC,
but it's actually stronger than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fair to say that you felt it more
strongly in your body as versus in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's probably true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if it started that way,
but it certainly seemed to end up that
[SPEAKER_06]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you weren't like going to go for a jog?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I had no, I had trouble walking from
one room to the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was afraid I was going to fall over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, one of those THCP accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that this should be a product
in an unregulated market sold like Delta 8
[SPEAKER_01]: and other, you know, THC acetate?
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of think those should be in a
regulated market too, myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure THC acetate is sold in an
unregulated market because under the
[SPEAKER_06]: federal law, CSA, THC acetate is
semi-synthetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So listen, you having Pinocchio up on the
screen there instead of your Dr. Seuss
[SPEAKER_10]: one, is this like a, is this a metaphor
that you're all pulling our legs here
[SPEAKER_10]: today or?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's because I was too stoned before
and I didn't even notice.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly did not even notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what THCP does to you folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts rotting your brain cell by cell.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's going on in California with
Alice and Wooksauce?
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are just growing weed and
processing weed and smoking weed and
[SPEAKER_10]: making hash and kind of living that life
or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This week there was Hall of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first like industry event that
was like B2B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty interesting to see how
the industry became just like any other
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Events with like free samples of
everything, high THC strains and people
[SPEAKER_02]: making a trend out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunch of fun designs of companies that you
look, the design is amazing, but once you
[SPEAKER_02]: see the product, it's not that
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was fun, but fun to see and a bunch
of good products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real marketing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like all the other products out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This doesn't look like a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun, like I had a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processing, less harvests, cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're taking like a little like road
break right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have like some plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking like a little indoor break,
maybe to the end of the year and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Flynn?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, I mean, obviously the same as
far as all the gardening stuff goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I thought Hall of Flowers was
pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely see, I don't know,
more big money openly coming into the
[SPEAKER_12]: field and spending a lot of money on,
you know, marketing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Marketing that product.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely getting the race just to
get a license and like have stuff on the
[SPEAKER_12]: shelves is getting less and less in the
race to like price points and hitting,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, hitting lower price points and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've definitely seen like the
solvent-less market change a lot in
[SPEAKER_12]: California in the last like year or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got way bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are multiple brands now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the popularity has definitely
increased.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of brands have started moving into
the space and putting out very
[SPEAKER_12]: consumer-friendly products, I will say,
respectfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next year, they will have a state fair in
Sacramento for the state of California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to have cannabis in it
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I saw that actually in the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of the actual ambassadors for the
actual event for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be promoting it and making it
aware as well as, yeah, there'll be,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll be able to get into the same golden
bear that you can get from any other
[SPEAKER_05]: agricultural product at the state fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be in July of 2022.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have submission information that will
be letting people know that now it is only
[SPEAKER_05]: open to legal growers and licensed growers
at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand there's a lot of
underground growers who definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: probably could throw their hat in the ring
quite well.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the, it is just open currently to
legal markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will be opening up a small
legal business and everybody that wants to
[SPEAKER_06]: give me a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be glad to enter yours into the
contest because I know yours is best.
[SPEAKER_12]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it going to be just flower or will
there be hash as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just flower this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's DHC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is the first start of the
first, you know, launch in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, we couldn't throw
everything in the ring out the gate.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I would anticipate since the foot
is in the door, we're going to see some
[SPEAKER_05]: progressions, but you know, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it goes again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's as first that I'm aware of,
it's the first state to actually include
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis within their state fair
competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to my first state fair ever
and it was very interesting to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, how is it going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people are going to try the flowers
or they're just going to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like, uh, a way for going
a beautiful city and see all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say, I am unsure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been to the California state fair
and they usually show, uh, the first,
[SPEAKER_05]: second and third, you know, so the,
the ribbon placers and then a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: the others, uh, it's never been done
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I'm unsure of the judging,
when it's going to take place,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it is going to be judged, et cetera,
at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is still, uh, information we are
gathering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but as ambassadors, we're just
initially promoting the event and making
[SPEAKER_05]: people aware of these submittal times and
information, uh, so that if they want to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, get involved, they, they know
where to, you know, come play.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder, are they going to allow cannabis
retailers to have booths there,
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, like they would at a cannabis
event.
[SPEAKER_12]: And will it be like a permitted event
where they could sell?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't the first year, they will
the second year, cause they're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: realize how much money there is that
advertisers really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: A farm to table.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so here it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my fact sheet up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who can enter the competition is open
to all licensed California cultivators,
[SPEAKER_05]: divisions and categories aligned with the
department of cannabis controls,
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed types to ensure proper
representation and support of California's
[SPEAKER_05]: legalized market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, SC labs will be doing the,
uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: for seven cannabis compound categories,
including two primary cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: THC and CBD, and five terpenes,
lemonine, pining, myrcine, karyophylline
[SPEAKER_05]: and terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the awards break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: The competition will be scored objectively
through science-based analysis performed
[SPEAKER_05]: by one of California's premier cannabis
and hemp testing labs, SC labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will provide all entrants with the
required certificate of analysis,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as the proprietary Fido facts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, chemometric reports that will quantify
all the unique compounds of the submission
[SPEAKER_05]: to determine the award winning flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Entered surviving for 77 awards for
cannabis flower, including medals for
[SPEAKER_05]: bronze, silver, and gold in each division
and category.
[SPEAKER_05]: Double gold will be awarded to those who
place gold in two or more categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven of the coveted best of California
golden bear, uh, trophies will be given to
[SPEAKER_05]: the best all around in each category,
regardless of division.
[SPEAKER_05]: So submissions will open in November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Submissions will close in March of 22
notified winners in May of 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a promotional tour in June
and then the California state fair award,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, celebration.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the fact sheet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it say how they're actually judged by
smoking?
[SPEAKER_06]: By analysis or the testing is one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not stated if smoking will be part
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will most likely be by testing
analysis at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open to knowing more, uh, because I am
an animal cup judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious to know where it's going to
go, but as ambassadors, this is what we've
[SPEAKER_05]: been tasked with at this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, we both know because we both have
seen the results of many analysis tests of
[SPEAKER_06]: cups and, uh, the one that's the highest
in THC or the one that looks the best,
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't necessarily the one that people
think is the best.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would anticipate like with,
since this is the first time in a new
[SPEAKER_05]: competition that, you know, these types
of, uh, discussions will, uh, be fruitful
[SPEAKER_05]: in that as things proceed forward,
because again, since it is new,
[SPEAKER_05]: as we saw with the animal cup,
it changed over time as things progressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would anticipate this potentiality
because of that specific, uh, connotation
[SPEAKER_05]: that you stated Sam and how, uh,
even though it looks good and looks as
[SPEAKER_05]: sexy as it doesn't mean it is the best
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but of course that's still
individually subjective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And individuals as a group will tend to
agree, but they all have their own
[SPEAKER_06]: preferences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some like it with CBD, some like it with
particular terpene sweets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, if that's your favorite,
that's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a matter of right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that you just like something
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, uh, it's, this is the guide
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So other state fairs, you know,
we've got, you know, quite a few,
[SPEAKER_05]: what, uh, 18 legal states now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, including Washington, DC,
but DC doesn't have its own fair cause
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but every state I've been to has a
state fair and some are definitely smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are larger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, California has its own permanent
pavilion with display areas in multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not even sure it'll, it'll be in
the agricultural section, most likely.
Um,
[SPEAKER_05]: very interested to see what the display
display area will look like as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: what we'll be able to see as well as,
you know, will it be the posting of the
[SPEAKER_05]: results with the flowers, et cetera,
you know, for people to see, to get a
[SPEAKER_05]: better understanding about how it is
technically judged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I've even ever been to the
state fair grounds in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, come on down in 2022 to the
California state fair and come see the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to some of the other counties.
[SPEAKER_06]: But not the state fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to like the Santa Cruz county
fair and some of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it, you know, if it's going to
be a county wide situation as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that, you know, some of the counties
can recognize that the state fair is
[SPEAKER_05]: because usually it's a succession.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the local, the local, then the
county, then the regional, then,
[SPEAKER_05]: then the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's be interesting to see as things
progress as well, since this is starting
[SPEAKER_05]: at this starting point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Humboldt county fair is going to be a good
one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then once they allow that, that's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, tell you no Mendocino to the
emerald triangle at Trinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not much business or I mean,
legal retail is just the, where,
[SPEAKER_05]: where location is unfortunately compared
to Humboldt Mendocino or correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'd agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you smoking on John?
[SPEAKER_10]: Derbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Derbs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go out on a limb and say he's smoking
on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Johnny B's Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been puffing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: One point with everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for my microphone and it was
like this small in the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Mark, I was smoking it,
the Medi Kush same thing, but it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: pocket tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been smoking a lot of this,
but if I put it in my pocket, it turns out
[SPEAKER_07]: creamy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to see everybody here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the 90 year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so happy with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever change to 73, I'll tell you
that much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now of course it's down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's making some amazing resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like some chem dog with some GMO
and this is fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's, I love the chem and then the
creme brulee you were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually saw the mom the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get cuttings from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the chem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't wait to see how that's going to
run.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course going to have to get it
tested first for that virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably does.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden this mom out of nowhere
goes, you want this?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, well, we'll put it over here
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we have to go and have it taken a
better look at, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dangerous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to enjoy this dab with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of hearing the torch, I'm going to
mute myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I for one am excited for shoulder
season, waiting for snowboarding season to
[SPEAKER_10]: begin in November.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shoulder season here on the West coast is
mushroom foraging season.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we get the next like multiple months to
go and pick Morales and turkey tails,
[SPEAKER_10]: lobsters, cauliflower, mushrooms,
rachis and red conchs and just all sorts
[SPEAKER_10]: of amazing chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a lot of tasty edible mushrooms,
but then we also have, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: very soon we'll start seeing cyanescence
and stunsies and baosistans and azorescens
[SPEAKER_10]: and semilensiatas all like growing in and
around my neighborhood, which is just
[SPEAKER_10]: every year in shoulder season.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember when I didn't know about
mushrooms, how I used to be bummed out
[SPEAKER_10]: about shoulder season, because it's just
rain and it's like, oh, we just had an
[SPEAKER_10]: amazing summer, but the rain hasn't turned
into snow yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just go into the forest and have a
beautiful hike.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was always fresh and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I discovered the mushroom and
that really changed everything for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what tastes do you like the best for
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_10]: I like chanterelles really a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love chanterelles for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a variety of them, like different
ones, like the golden foots and the
[SPEAKER_10]: yellows.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's there's like three or four
different chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the little golden foot ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very they're not very big,
but I made a couple of soups last year
[SPEAKER_10]: with those ones and they were spectacular.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like the texture of the
cauliflower mushroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's beautiful for for pasta.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just goes real nice with even a white
or a red sauce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And and some nice pasta.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm stoked on getting out there soon
and picking even porcinis right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are picking right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bolets, admiral bolets growing,
you know, popping out right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So and not just in the Pacific Northwest,
for that matter, wherever you are,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can look into your amateur mycology
groups that are in and around your cities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's people in every city into this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mushroom community is very much
like the cannabis community in the sense
[SPEAKER_10]: that it's it wants you to know the
information.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, yeah, check this out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you got to check this out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's my little spiel on mushroom
picking, because I'm super excited about
[SPEAKER_10]: the mushrooms popping out here soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give me my little I love the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's talking about what that THTP
and how high you get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I've lost weight, I am getting
slammed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get so high from doing dabs like right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just did a dab and I am just I don't get
this high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lately, wow, I think like THTP holding
on the fat cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's a real thing because lately
for me, it's been like awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny, it's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good way to to, you know,
express that you're getting healthier.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, congratulations on working
out that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that's that's a that's a really I
think everyone we all need more of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need more inspiration to be healthier
and eat better and exercise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, this morning, 64 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get up and walk every morning,
every every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get up and walk 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do slight stretching.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like just having those nano shots
in my smoothies for paying attention to
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and it's been and now, like I say,
and when you're talking about taking those
[SPEAKER_07]: those higher cheatsies during the day and
then in the afternoon at night,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing these like CBD balanced 50
50s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm definitely getting a lot higher
from just a regular dab that I would do
[SPEAKER_07]: two or three of now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I'm just healthier and feeling a
lot better with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks, Colin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody here for, you know,
always educating and telling us more how
[SPEAKER_07]: we feel about every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
I'm high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be high on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's how's your season going,
my friend?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to get to see you and also great
to hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's how's the summer been for you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pretty challenging summer,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty vigorous fire season here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four fires in Nevada County in one
month, all of them caused by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The me personally, I've been experiencing
a lot of turmoil within myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot about all of the effort and years of
time I put into trying to create
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable regulations both locally and at
the state level and to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: disastrously the legal market is unfolding
for the people who have done this work
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years is really it's hard because
I care a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot about patient access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about quality product and all of
those things are not doing very well in
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal kind of California cannabis
market these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever I hear people getting excited
about the idea of federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think of how badly California did
it and cannot imagine that the feds would
[SPEAKER_00]: do any better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I I have a few plants in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying how that's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the simplicity of doing something I
love because I love it, not because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to change the world or or even in
this case, in my case, trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: specific versions of cannabis that might
be of help to certain families,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That work has been taken on by our local
cannabis alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've created a donation program that's
very closely modeled on what we were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm grateful to the legal farmers and
manufacturers and distributors and
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers that are involved in that
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for me personally, it's been a
rough summer between fire and some health
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, what's the growing
realization of how badly the California
[SPEAKER_00]: legal scheme is working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a rough summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll just say the Department of
Cannabis Control, which is the new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory agency, just published 390
pages of emergency regulations and allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: five days for public comment on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a pretty good ways into those
pages and found a whole bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't want to even go down that
hole, but yeah, that's kind of where
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade's at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really glad to see a last minute
call out to do Hash Church this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's really a joy to see some
people I have such deep respect for and
[SPEAKER_00]: how how grateful I am for the opportunity
to just hear people who have this plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and and are still trying to change
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where Wade's at at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for calling me out, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Wade, I think you you have changed
the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite honestly, your contributions with
your varietals have actually moved the
[SPEAKER_11]: needle.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think you know, I think we you know,
that that should be known.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's not, I see you over there and
I hope you you see it, too, because it's
[SPEAKER_11]: it's it's very apparent, you know,
the contribution is real.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think humbly, you know, I hope we
all can can help, you know, follow in your
[SPEAKER_11]: footsteps, my man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for for for doing the work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for doing the work, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: We we we you know, I often think of
Forrest as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even when I saw you come in today,
I was like, oh, man, I got to like I spoke
[SPEAKER_10]: to him a few times on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know he's also had some difficult
times and figured to get him on here and
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe just spread the love a little bit
because we have the whole community has a
[SPEAKER_10]: huge, huge respect for for both you and
Forrest and the things that you've done
[SPEAKER_10]: for catastrophically ill children and in,
you know, just being kind and being real
[SPEAKER_10]: in an industry that has a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, you know, when you were
talking about how federal legalization and
[SPEAKER_10]: I always have faith in cannabis,
we got through prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now we're getting into a new battle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this new battle is, you know,
when you go mainstream, not only are the
[SPEAKER_10]: mainstream people who are going to try and
get those paychecks and who mastered those
[SPEAKER_10]: systems, so they'll get themselves into
position right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: The key people that you don't want in
those positions that's one part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you're also expanding and
bringing in this whole new group of people
[SPEAKER_10]: that now has changed the face of what
makes up the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_10]: because it used to be this very small kind
of rootsy group.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's like everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh, you're all you're all in
the group now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think it's taking time for our
subset groups to channel within those
[SPEAKER_10]: groups and to actually find our foundation
and be like, you know, because listen,
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when people were going to
prison and I swear there was nothing worse
[SPEAKER_10]: than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That that was the worst.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have to agree about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This sucks and hurts my heart as well,
because it doesn't quite get you the way
[SPEAKER_10]: locking up our friends for life did that
really got under our asses.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is more subdued and more like,
no, but you can grow a few plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, don't worry about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, so I feel you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a battle.
[SPEAKER_10]: But think of the battle we just got
through that most of us never thought we
[SPEAKER_10]: were ever going to get through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, you know, we're in another
battle now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully we, you know, good people
can continue to put their intention
[SPEAKER_10]: towards good things, you know,
to making things work out in a way that I
[SPEAKER_10]: don't mind if people come up with ways
that make this better and make them
[SPEAKER_10]: profit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't want people who are parasitic
to suck the life force out of our culture
[SPEAKER_10]: while using terms like we're trying to
build a better culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like we already have a culture,
you know, why don't you come in and absorb
[SPEAKER_10]: our culture that the culture actually
created itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: And and I still have faith, you know,
I'm in a federal regulated situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's it's been.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty intense the last couple of years,
it's gone ups and downs and it's been
[SPEAKER_10]: traumatic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's still pretty rough out there,
like being a small fish in a in an ocean
[SPEAKER_10]: full of giant sharks.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was easy, no, everyone would be
doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also eternal vigilance is the
price of cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't put our feet up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I do like about the legal
standardization or you're just talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about in the federal laws that you're
jumping through the hoops and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: getting to those stages.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are starting to see some type of
standardization when it comes to some of
[SPEAKER_07]: these products that really we've been
looking for in the medical aspects,
[SPEAKER_07]: like like I've been talking about these
nano shots and some of these drinks have
[SPEAKER_07]: been really like game changers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might mean my father is having these
balanced drinks and he's seeing a change.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice to be able to offer these
products to people that can actually just
[SPEAKER_07]: go to the store and we obtain some of
these and be able to get a benefit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get that relief that they've now been
looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's it's fabulous to start seeing
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't like it, but I think
everybody here would concur that this is
[SPEAKER_07]: the greatest thing that we'd be fighting
for and seeing these legal products that
[SPEAKER_07]: people can actually obtain and be able to
get relief from is something that I've
[SPEAKER_07]: just it's awesome to see lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just so happy about it, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can honestly say I've been fighting for
the last 50 years for THCP.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some of that THCP, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, finally, finally came.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what you're speaking about about the
cultural separation is something that is
[SPEAKER_05]: an inherent problem we have because
marketers from any other line of reality
[SPEAKER_05]: has created their own cultures in the
sense or try to create them around
[SPEAKER_05]: products, around ideas, whereas the
problem they find is that you can't cash
[SPEAKER_05]: in on cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about being real and marketing and
all that isn't about being real.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're trying to impose their wills
and ideas on something that they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: even quantify, that they haven't even
bothered the time to immerse themselves
[SPEAKER_05]: into quantify.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming at it from a product
perspective as opposed to an understanding
[SPEAKER_05]: that a lot of us here risked our lives and
our freedoms to try to keep this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: perpetually perpetuated against every way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And out of persistence and dogged
persistence, we've actually realized these
[SPEAKER_05]: realities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as I say, I don't like your reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to substitute it with my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have substituted cannabis into the
reality of the world through hard work,
[SPEAKER_05]: labor, dedication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brothers and sisters are still going to
jail here in America.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the job isn't done here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have federal legalization,
but the marketers in these small little
[SPEAKER_05]: 10th Amendment experimental realities
where we are, are completely off the
[SPEAKER_05]: rails.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to encapsulate something
they can't even grasp and they won't even
[SPEAKER_05]: take the time to understand or immerse
themselves to a point where they should
[SPEAKER_05]: know a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should know what's, you know,
a collegiate network.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be the ones funding it and
promoting it as opposed to them being lost
[SPEAKER_05]: to the dustbin and left to the side.
[SPEAKER_05]: No offense in any way, shape or form,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how the, unfortunately the
marketers don't know how to market it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same way why, you know,
it isn't sexy going around talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: giving free weed to everybody,
but we still had to go around and pass SD,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, laws here in California,
45 to actually 35, pardon me, to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: still be able to give away free cannabis
because that isn't and wasn't established.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though things have changed,
we still have to continue to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: change, but cannabis culture just needs to
continue to just be itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck all this marketing and all that other
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do you, and all the marketing will be
continued to be ignored as they try to
[SPEAKER_05]: shape it into, oh, this, that,
that way and the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be what it's going to be,
which is why, you know, the emerald cups
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that will continue to exist
because the over-regulation is a
[SPEAKER_05]: whitewashing of cannabis, whereas the
culture still exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still in the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are still going around with male
scales and weighing out eighths and ounces
[SPEAKER_05]: and dealers are still doing well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the underground hasn't
stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just being marketed differently and
terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: United nations actually recognizes culture
and we're going to be working on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: culture as itself, but not this marketed
shit that we're being served.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to get off my soapbox.
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides that, I've already copyrighted
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Oh, that was a long lawsuit between
the owner of friendly stranger,
[SPEAKER_10]: Robin and Mark Emery from cannabis culture
that went on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That fight over the name cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good old cannabis industry, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't copyright the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I copyrighted the concept of cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any cannabis culture belongs to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thankfully that means it's in good
hands, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send all your Bitcoin to Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll sell it to you cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Culture coin.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a time when that was cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, before I forget, can we talk a
little bit about how beautiful the dog is
[SPEAKER_10]: that you guys have there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That Australian shepherd is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just made it from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just brought my two dogs from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been two years away from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super hard, but thankfully we made
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Mookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mookie say hi to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's actually, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a smoothie in front of the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Shetland sheepdog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not like an Australian shepherd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's this size.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will be this size forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has seven years old actually.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be back with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going through some issues like skin
issues and stuff, but we're trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to solve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dogs with breeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when you, when you breed too
much with the dogs and sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the other three dogs we have,
they're mutts and not mutts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you say it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them have any issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the genetic variations and things
like this make them like way stronger for
[SPEAKER_10]: on life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that interesting that we call them
mutts, but then we call the purebreds,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you're like, here, get this dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like four years later, the thing is
like suffering terribly with hip
[SPEAKER_10]: dysplasia.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like grinding its hips on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, what, what the fuck are we
doing in life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we compare that with cannabis too?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the breeding, people breeding crazy
things or no, what do you think was?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Sam probably has more experience
than anyone here, but I think when you
[SPEAKER_11]: exhaust lines, things, you know,
bad things can happen if you start
[SPEAKER_11]: selecting, you know, unknowingly,
you know, I think cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_06]: out-crosser, which means when you use
small population numbers and you only
[SPEAKER_06]: breed within a given small number of
plants that it doesn't do as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It for really vigorous cannabis,
you want to out-cross it cross,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, tie with Afghan, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create the real mutts of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's differences too,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause in cannabis we're looking to breed,
you know, cultivars that probably get us
[SPEAKER_10]: very high or have a particular bouquet to
them, not necessarily how they look.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas dogs were more like, sure,
certain dogs were bred to do certain
[SPEAKER_10]: things, but other dogs like the German
shepherd, had a really nice straight back.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the guy who bred it down,
who gave it that super humped out,
[SPEAKER_10]: like, so it just goes down at the back.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the hips kind of go way down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at old photos of the
German shepherd and what it looks like
[SPEAKER_10]: today, and it's one of the dogs that ends
up getting that hip dysplasia,
[SPEAKER_10]: like the worst out of all the breeds,
because this guy just thought it looked
[SPEAKER_10]: super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like he was just like, this is the,
this, this is how we should breed this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, I think that's kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because we're dealing with
living animals, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That feel and live like for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you, but my cannabis is
living also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's, it's feeling different than a
dog though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat, I don't eat meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I eat salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, I don't, I don't mind
killing the salad to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind much about the Canada
screams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear their screams when I pull up
the little carrots or the little baby
[SPEAKER_06]: corns or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear them screaming like hell,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I just go murder the animals
instead.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's get, you can get into some pretty
trippy philosophies there, like in regards
[SPEAKER_10]: to how you feel about breeding a plant
versus breeding a dog or versus eating an
[SPEAKER_10]: animal versus eating a plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've definitely seen some pretty good
arguments on both sides.
[SPEAKER_10]: I say that people should just be
themselves and do what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only innocence are the areterians.
[SPEAKER_10]: The areterians, the breatharians.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The breatharians aren't bothering anyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, when you stay at your house,
they never eat anything out of your
[SPEAKER_06]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they take a breath of air,
they might, they might be swallowing a few
[SPEAKER_06]: insects or viruses or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's murder.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not too many breatharians out
there though, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a short lifespan.
[SPEAKER_06]: In India, you probably saw Jane,
Jane temples and the Janes, the really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really orthodox devout ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sweep the sidewalk before they walk
on it to make sure that they don't
[SPEAKER_06]: accidentally step on any ants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweeping ants is okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stepping on them is a huge no-no in the
culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've been looking a lot and
thinking a lot about mutations in leaf,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, in the way that leaf leaf
structure has, has kind of formed in the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was wondering if when things like
Australian bastard and duckfoot were kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of isolated, you know, historically we've
kind of like, we've bred these plants with
[SPEAKER_11]: these five finger, these, these,
these very traditional leaf sets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why have we not moved away from these in,
in terms of resin production?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it, do you think that's intentionally
something that certain breeders just start
[SPEAKER_11]: looking towards?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because let's face it, some of the,
some of these like plant cells and these,
[SPEAKER_11]: these, these, these water leaves are just
problematic.
[SPEAKER_11]: So why, why wouldn't we just start
breeding towards better, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: morphology that kind of lends it toward,
lends itself towards extraction.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're not defoliating at week 21.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then again, going back and touching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are doing, people are doing
both.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are doing it for, what did they
call them?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole name of them besides
duckfoot and Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's like fern or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Humboldt seeds are selling from the
breeder guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't see, I don't see any advantage
in growing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any advantage in growing them
other than they look trippy.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I've just never seen like,
you know, in terms of population,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen traits in terms of resin
production from any of these, these types
[SPEAKER_11]: of, you know, morphologies that,
that lend itself to what, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're talking about here in terms of
resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, it just seems over time,
you know, there, there, there should be
[SPEAKER_11]: individuals looking at this at a deeper,
from a deeper perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I know I've, I've been
playing around with it for the past couple
[SPEAKER_11]: of years and I've been some really
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope others are doing it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to be, but I, I sort of gave up
with a world phyletoxy and diploids and
[SPEAKER_06]: triploid and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and there were differences,
but yeah, the freak show is I think really
[SPEAKER_06]: trippy looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: But whether it has any practical
application, I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, likewise.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that, I think there's opportunity
for the right person to, to really work
[SPEAKER_11]: the lines, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm to be honest, I'm more interested
in the cannabinoid interpene contents than
[SPEAKER_06]: anything else I want.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's, that's exactly what I'm
after.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, what I, what I'm trying to
illustrate, I guess, is what if we had
[SPEAKER_11]: less biomass around it and it was,
it was more focused on the resin rather
[SPEAKER_11]: than.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can do that with a, with more of
a, what people call sativa, narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: drug variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But with widely drug varieties,
like Afghans, they often have just as much
[SPEAKER_06]: resin on the leaves as the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So reducing the leaf content isn't going
to necessarily increase the resin content.
[SPEAKER_11]: True.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now from a contamination point of view,
just in water hash, that's what I'm,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's really where I'm thinking,
you know, the contamination perspective in
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to remove some of that material,
maybe it'd be good for, for, for sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think you're illustrating some
really good points, but it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's, it's definitely something I
think about a lot though.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, I appreciate your perspective on
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's, as you know, it's,
it's just, there's, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: people that are publicly talking about
this, this type of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of people doing it
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we first started on it 20 years ago,
there was nobody, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people breeding for cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The minor cannabinoids are pretty easy to
get.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD obviously is easy to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBG is easy to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: THCV is fairly easy to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CBC, I don't think that's so easy to
get, but I bet you can get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, it's fair.
[SPEAKER_11]: With everything that's going on in
Afghanistan, do you think Sam,
[SPEAKER_11]: from your perspective, seeing all these
changes over the decades that you've seen,
[SPEAKER_11]: do you think cannabis farming will be,
will still prevail in that region?
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly cannot predict what the Taliban
is going to do because they've been on
[SPEAKER_06]: both sides of the line of drug dealing and
taxing drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, they, they said they were
suppressing the opium growing,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they were taxing the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't believe anything they say,
and I don't know how anybody can
[SPEAKER_06]: rationally predict what they're actually
going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do any of you follow like Baba's work,
Baba87?
[SPEAKER_02]: You all follow him?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got actually very worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was even talking to Kim and Demkinoli
too, because since like Taliban got full
[SPEAKER_02]: on power and power, he actually hasn't
posted anything on Instagram and haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: said anything, but this last week he
answered for the first time so I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if anyone here is connected with him,
but it looks like he's still here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world with us and feel like they're
watching, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he didn't give much information on like
what's going on or like where is he or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, just wanted to share
with y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if any of you like, I've got a
street address, just ask me and I'll send
[SPEAKER_06]: it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually Himalayan connection is in the
chat, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now saying Baba is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a very, it was very,
very happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cheers to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anybody's street address.
[SPEAKER_11]: It counts out to Indian land race
exchange.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the work that all of you are all
doing collectively is very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank you very much for doing that
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm glad to get together on a Sunday
afternoon while it's raining out for a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of hours of hash church.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a stop at 11 today.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's anything anyone in particular
wants to bring up or talk about,
[SPEAKER_10]: or we can just let the conversation
organically evolve and call it a day at 11
[SPEAKER_10]: o 'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everybody needs a blowtorch to
sanitize their tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying we're going to use flame.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one way you can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also put it in a, a peroxide or
bleach dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Using a bleach dip is what we've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we're using both of those will
destroy viruses on contact heat and bleach
[SPEAKER_07]: various dips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So bleach and not isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of people were just using an ISO
dipping in their scissors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I honestly don't know what's better
ISO or bleach, but I've used bleach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never used ISO, so I can't speak for
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say bleach.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_11]: ISO is not known to kill the virus from
what I understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, Colin, that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we got to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is important that people,
they're trying to use ISO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for really saying that it's not
going to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's really reinforce this.
[SPEAKER_07]: People got to use bleach.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got to make sure their scissors are
clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if possible, keep them tied to their
strains until they know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'm reading, what we're saying,
you can have a plant that's infected,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I might not see it for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's, there's some bad actors as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: There, there are plants that, you know,
like Chem D has a variegation to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it may seem like it, but you know,
we've, we've extensively tested those from
[SPEAKER_11]: other sources around and we haven't found
it on that variety quite yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would say also, make sure you,
you're, you're, you're using clean water
[SPEAKER_11]: to, to just water your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fusarium is a big problem right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And other, other types of things like
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will actually, that could
actually produce and bring out plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: bring out the virus in plants that are not
showing the traits.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're plants that are, you know,
for instance, we have a plant that was,
[SPEAKER_11]: that was, that was brought into us and it
didn't show any traits of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you grew it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not great.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can extract everything extracted fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you tested a sample and it came
hot, came back hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so these are the things we've got to
work through.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's other plants that are actually
resistant to this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we then I think that's the next step
is to start isolating and understanding.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which plants are resistant and how long
are they resistant?
[SPEAKER_06]: One way you can tell is for example,
in the grape industry, when you buy grape
[SPEAKER_06]: stocks to plant a new grape vineyard,
it's all certified virus free.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same thing with strawberry clones,
strawberry starts from Driscoll.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all guaranteed virus free.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the future, that will be the case
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people buy, you know, if they're
buying 50,000 or a hundred thousand clones
[SPEAKER_06]: each year, they want to get the same clone
and they want it certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want it certified virus free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret is the only one selling virus free
currently that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will be more in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Logical supposedly issues that can,
you know, infect plants through cloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been perpetuating clones and
these problems for decades, which is why
[SPEAKER_05]: it also takes so long for them to pull
these things out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they're so deeply embedded and it's
in the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have to pull it out even before
it's in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's even more than that
because I found 27 viruses that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: IDed in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them cause symptoms,
but they were transmittable and there was
[SPEAKER_06]: 27 of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I know that there's a whole bunch
of other bacteria and fungus and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's got to be a little bit bigger than
the number you said.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what's being quantified
currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone in the chat more knowledge,
more experience, more expansion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone in the chat just said,
doesn't most nurseries have a lab testing
[SPEAKER_11]: for this?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not most labs do not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, most nurseries do not have a lab
that works with them for these types of
[SPEAKER_11]: iroids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's problematic.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, that's why we all need to bring
better guidance to the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we all have some sort of ideology
around what to do when this pops up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most nurseries honestly don't even know
the 27 viruses that have been found in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't even know how to identify those
viruses and what to look for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even really what you're growing and
like this, you really got to look for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you start noticing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there are, yeah, to identify is
the next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that there's these viruses now
being able to identify them and which ones
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to affect the yields or resin
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they have no symptoms,
it's really hard to identify them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes there can be three or four
of them that are symptomless, but combined
[SPEAKER_06]: they do have symptoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it won't be until they hit a growth
threshold that they actually trigger and
[SPEAKER_05]: those viruses activate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have different ones activate
across the spectrum of your garden,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on where it is in the isolation
that's actually taking place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, it's serious.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can all put this back too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can rid the plant and there's a lot of
studies showing that it's actually showed
[SPEAKER_11]: back up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the deeper thing for me that
just gets, you know, look, I'm a clone
[SPEAKER_11]: kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I came from a clone era.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you eliminate it, it's gone unless it's
reinfected by a contaminated tool or an
[SPEAKER_06]: insect or something else reinfects it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there could be nematodes that
are infected.
[SPEAKER_06]: There could be various things that are
infected.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you truly get rid of it,
it's gone until it is reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you believe that it has to be
reintroduced?
[SPEAKER_11]: It had been suggested to me before,
Sam, that it could come back from the
[SPEAKER_11]: tissue because it's a virus, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, in theory, I guess that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then if it comes back, that means you
didn't get rid of it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, even more, there's more layers
on layers, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that we can go through the
process.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be a 12 month process to
understand all this or any of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll keep you updated as I go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there's someone at SEGRA,
you guys can introduce me to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're open to talking about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same page here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to just chat with someone
about understanding what they found and,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably Ian would be the best person for
you to talk to.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he would, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the problem with SEGRA is they
have a lot of time, money, and energy
[SPEAKER_06]: devoted to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't want to share their insider
tricks so freely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they will share some of their
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Still worth chatting with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you have access to a company that
can clean your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, even at all else, guys,
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have some stuff dropped off
on Monday at a place over here in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Fraser Valley to start getting some
strains tested and start identifying some
[SPEAKER_07]: of the symptoms we might be seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then talk more with you guys about
some of these viruses that are really
[SPEAKER_07]: infecting some of the strains that are
helping a lot of additional patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really the killer is that a lot
of these strains that are being infected
[SPEAKER_07]: are really the one of the main strains
that are being used out here, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody else has their main key
strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually being hit here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the main houses with the main strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing is most people are
just going to call it because if you're in
[SPEAKER_11]: the regulated markets, it's the single of
the week in the music world, but it's the
[SPEAKER_11]: flavor of the week in the cannabis world,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're constantly playing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that are being passed around.
[SPEAKER_11]: But some of these plants have been around
for 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would hate one day to find out
the California orange has hot blade virus
[SPEAKER_11]: and I can't fix it, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my biggest concern, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care about these newer things that
we're giving out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be fixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sager will grow it, take tips from the
tip, tip, tip, tippy part, grow it again,
[SPEAKER_06]: do that several times in a row,
and it comes out clean and virus free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for me, that's my big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been running my same strain since
2005.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I fear that I may actually have that
disease because it was spread through
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody that I know I have maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'm like freaking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to lose something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of other people have those
strains that they rely on and that they
[SPEAKER_07]: use every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they get this disease, they might
lose what they value so much for what they
[SPEAKER_07]: need.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep your grow room clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep everything clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't pass around dirty cuts and try to
use QPCR when you can, kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not very expensive to get these tests
done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you test your stuff and don't
unsuspectively pass things around.
[SPEAKER_07]: $30 or $35 to get the leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to end it with a small
video that I put up on Instagram the other
[SPEAKER_10]: day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone was just asking about it in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is Verdant down in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they grabbed one of our craft units
from Whistler Technologies, this like
[SPEAKER_10]: little compact, not super little,
but much smaller than most of the hash
[SPEAKER_10]: making equipment we make at Whistler
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just thought it was a tight fit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tight video.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Carolina, who went down there
and filmed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to share my screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a 40 second video.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very short, but worth sharing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy Hash Church, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're crushing it over there at Verdant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally and figuratively.
[SPEAKER_11]: The market is walk us through this
machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the filtration there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks clean to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we all know that sounds so well,
the spoon hitting the freeze dryer tray.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't hear you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do one last dab before we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask you to walk us through
the machine because I feel like I know
[SPEAKER_11]: what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I all of a sudden said to myself,
maybe I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, I'm going to bring like
Daniel and maybe one of the engineers on
[SPEAKER_10]: here soon, like in the next couple of
weeks, and they can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that collection piece right there
is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're loving it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sent us pictures of them like hugging
it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm going through this hop,
latent viral disease right now through
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody around me, every house that I go
to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's gotten infected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's being tested lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a ship storm around me.
Sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's destroying places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started talking about, we heard about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then as we were being safe about it
and trying to be so safe, it still
[SPEAKER_07]: happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like separating scissors, everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were using ISO.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that was the big thing right
there, Colin and Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think bleach has to not hit all of these
places.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to make sure that happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: To a lot of people I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go buy a bunch of bleach
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best places that are doing tissue
culture and stuff, they have Bunsen
[SPEAKER_06]: burners that are burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they put the tools under the Bunsen
burners in between.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill it with fire, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill it with fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on that note, peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a great night.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.
