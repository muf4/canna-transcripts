[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at Medical Seeds here at the
Spanimus 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're with a bubble ambassador here,
Javier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to show us his herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his bubble hashes here,
his earls.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got it all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to take us a little bit through
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're showing me the Canadian Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Canadian Kush is a genetic I created
for the European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring the genetics from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Kush and special Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elite clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm one of the professional
growers in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three years ago, I grew in the second
place in Sativa, California, 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I changed my fucking elite clone with
a different clone, a different grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did
[SPEAKER_01]: you do something different on your own?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in Spain, in Europe, the Kush is a
new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely like BC Bud, LA Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just straight up some nice
Kush, beautiful Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a genetic I present in the square.
[SPEAKER_02]: I present in many cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I win three or four cups now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I win this year in Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: When
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you, I was like, man, I only meet
maybe a few guys like this if I'm lucky,
[SPEAKER_01]: per event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like over four days or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute I met him, I was like,
dude, this guy's a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's doing good things in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my new creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: My new creation, the regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is regular, not feminine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first strain I create in
regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one at one, because I want the people
selected more different genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have the real Navy case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this clone 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's the real case.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Amsterdam, it's a really difficult
plant for growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16?
[SPEAKER_02]: 16, 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you make seeds, maybe two weeks
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I cross to Deep Chang for cutting the
weeds for flowering.
Deep Chang.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Hill, Deep Chang?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Chang.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You selected?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected one man, Deep Chang.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected three or four different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, this is Deep Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's number three, short.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Spain, corto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corto, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Deep Neville, strain three,
large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is kind of fruity and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang, dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's reminiscent of almost what I saw
years and years and years ago when they
[SPEAKER_01]: claimed that there was the UBC chemo,
or the BC chemo, like the scientists or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it dried, it was almost just like
ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't really break it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Deep Neville three, corto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm my favorite because I like more the
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's more longer, it's more sativa,
more cases.
Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: More exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut out that time, you cut out that
time, you use that turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those flavors, you know, the turpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the English word for the smells and
the tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go long, the hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get those spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfume or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acid, a little bit acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is number 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: I select because half so much crystal is
so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was your hazed one and this was
your crystal one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but this is the same Deep Neville,
a different genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got them jarred up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got them in some really nice jars and
well, like professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, the guy isn't professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice resin, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always awkward if someone shows you
something that's not like, you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to lie and tell people like, that's super
awesome when it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really superb, like fucking primo
herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know for a fact, if I made hash out
of this, it would absolutely be fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, the smell, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that, cameraman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that some good shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're getting into a more hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: More hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure is like sativa soup,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is much more sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that spice is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like campfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever had smoke in your clothes,
how cool does that smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last minute on the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the Deep Neville number three,
L, which I'm guessing is long ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the queen of sativas,
the medical seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2046.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows to Maryl Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows to Kali Mees before 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wore it with the older genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was even more heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from 97 to 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last seconds on the battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stop it and we'll cut back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the actual.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of a genotype Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a strong smell at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a strong smell at all,
but definitely looks like a decent purple
[SPEAKER_01]: herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not usually a huge fan of purple herb,
but as a photographer, I love the aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: of fall colors in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we're getting to my favorite
personal part, which is the water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the first, I think the best part for
the final.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to show us his oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to show us his extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Javier does it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping to get him a little bit on
the dry set, to show him a few tips on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to clean dry set to 99% pure gland heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the next year I'm going to
come and you're going to have a whole one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these full of dry set, all these pure
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are your go throughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to show us these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make the different styles for the people
who know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For try the different strains,
how is the best different process for the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I make, for example,
the griega.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good for solder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I make a butter, it's more
wax that I prefer coconut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The coconut butter in Spain say when it's
too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in Spain, no, it's wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's miguita de pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miguita de pan is white bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part of the bread is inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fresh plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even make oil, but I know resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight pan, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, I prefer make butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you can smell the turpenoise and how
smell the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 100% I like more smoke bubble house
and mechanic extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love mechanical myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer finger house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right off your own fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's earned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I smoke, but it's really strong
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I learn, after every different
process, I know the gas is inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, I say, it's the laboratory,
the specialist say.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tested by the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you showed your textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer more my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are his varieties of bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how Javier is very much the
perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to categorize and just nice,
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all the packaging, the dual and
triple packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pressed, some powderized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double high five from the bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but some people like more press and
some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have all the people covered right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, I don't know, you want to
try something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I did bring a D-nail,
but I also brought a bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just easily pull the bong out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a screen of any sort,
we might have to drop a screen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can do that, we'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do jabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to heat it up with the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I hope I brought a jabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a little bit of aqua and the
bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have enough, but something
better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, champs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the treating yourself dash champs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking over from Marco Renda and John
from Skunk, and I believe the guys from
[SPEAKER_01]: Champs are co-working the event,
and that'll be in May in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it'd be great to see you there
with entering some screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we're going to take a dab or
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pull something out,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the
[SPEAKER_02]: powder bubble, what I like to do is I
usually take a little dabber, and I
[SPEAKER_01]: usually have an electric nail,
so I'll heat it up on the quartz,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then literally just stick it in there
hot, and the powder just sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to press it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bowl is like $280 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bowl is like a couple hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it dry, quartz is hard to
blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I do okay there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I butcher your language?
[SPEAKER_02]: We make in two languages, in Spanish and
English at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to make... It's important
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photo essay style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technical and too much photo because the
people... No, no, you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have too many photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for example, this is the index.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The risk, therapeutic, mechanical
extraction, and chemical extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduction, for example, the first...
Warning signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warning, warning, warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowledge, teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in Spain, we have so much
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and if you're going to teach people
this sort of information, it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: that you teach them the safety first,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information about the heats, information
about the risks, the solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: The different system for safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the carrots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell from the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and I'm obsessed with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first part is the medicinal
extraction, like a team food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you made all, most of this is all you
and your photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my work, the last thing,
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that, it looked great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for salads, for massage,
for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the bottle, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Simpson, oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, after the next... Do you do
some explaining in this book on the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I explain a little bit about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the next step on showing all these
steps on the safety and why are people
[SPEAKER_02]: using it and what is it doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I show the different methods of extraction
and the different methods that you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, the creams and everything,
the different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I study about everything, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I study more than when I'm young,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the wheat in the bag, like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You call it dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after with the... In the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality, great quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole process, you start to finish
with the strainers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make the different techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is with machine, with cow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, this looks like Skypan Sands
almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get that from?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Mendocino purple goose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the... When I make for inside in
the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the sample.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this one recently, one like it
that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you're playing with your
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a hit while he's
talking, because I still haven't taken
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fed a couple out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found you out, but I'm kind of full.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you guys again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to sit over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can both sit over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to both be... Well, okay,
I'll sit here for now, and then I'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: a few spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aftertaste on that is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fruity candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some crazy fruity candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the YY or EY.
[SPEAKER_01]: 73 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let me know if I can lend you a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say you want to smoke the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash will pick the hash out now.
A lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can honestly say I'm not sure that I've
ever personally seen this much extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: information in one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last information is about the VHL,
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturn, Ponycom, Moonrook.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make soft-steak extractions with
harpoon, and it's so meditationally
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who are you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make ice cream with you, but a long time
ago, I win so many cups, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: who are you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see you in Canada, it's like an
ISE.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a more exciting personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to share the information with people
like yourself, who I always have called
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they go out in the world,
and they just share the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is enough to inspire people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who walks around with a thing like
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an inspiration to any hash smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know many of you will be watching this
on Bubble Man World.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please comment if you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a hash collection like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all need one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why guys like you and me,
where we do this and we inspire people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know more people are going to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people see this video, they're going
to go do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people read your book, they're going
to know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they watch you win all your cups,
every year, people are like, Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy some seeds from Javier.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people told me how you make it,
but I explain everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still?
[SPEAKER_02]: I explain everything in the book,
but the people say, no, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, promise you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always think that we're keeping
back on secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I present everybody's secret because I
don't want insight in their fucking cups
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to teach the people, the people to
make really good change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more substance behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more important than just winning a
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to leave here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to attach myself to this thing the
whole time I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Span of this 2014, Javier from Medical
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you again soon.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
