do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am over here at high integrity glass
art For those of you that aren't familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: and as always he's got Some epic piece of
glass out for me to enjoy I did do a video

I believe it was and this is of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership gates in depi Tuca,
so it's got the two spots right here
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally designed it was going to have
hoses Rolled from high integrity glass art
[SPEAKER_00]: requested some customization and got these
mouthpieces done So I'll show those up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera later so you guys can see the
quality in that so you can have the two
[SPEAKER_00]: Rips at once and I've got some West Coast
concentrate here that I'm going to dip
[SPEAKER_00]: into something new I was going to try the
three times crazy Just getting up actually
[SPEAKER_00]: not even up on the website Although by the
time I edit this video and share this
[SPEAKER_00]: video it could potentially be up by then

so just do a little Just do a little rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: dab with a turp dip Three times crazy out
of the tuca Got to show you some close-ups
[SPEAKER_00]: with the camera The quality of the marbles
this little universe marble the gates is

Explosion and a little red ruby Mars like
[SPEAKER_00]: planet floating at the top as you move
yourself around you see this variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: planets and Galaxies showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nothing shy of epic between depi
and gates and the big Base is covered in a
[SPEAKER_00]: collage of marbles done by the two artists
to nothing short of perfection and Got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little drop down in here with a D nail.

nails built right into the table Really
