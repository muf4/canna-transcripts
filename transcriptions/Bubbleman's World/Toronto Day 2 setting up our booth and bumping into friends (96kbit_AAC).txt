[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man and John here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got to the convention and we're
setting up our booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Green Planets right beside us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Tater and Bubble Bags are in one long
booth and everyone's just chaotically
[SPEAKER_02]: putting shit together right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a little pan on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not us, hey John?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are building three-dimensional
frames and shit, boxes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: John and I are a little more low-key.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the Mettaners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys here in a bit once we
get the booth built up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: John and I are getting a little closer to
making our booths look good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of coming along fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, big thanks to the weed guy,
Mark Cloakey, who did up these posters for
[SPEAKER_02]: us of our photographs of Medi Kush buds
and Skunk Man Sam's Dry Sift and Remo's
[SPEAKER_02]: UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got pictures of the Zombie Kush and
Ripper Sea at the front of the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of doing it up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just actually now finishing up one
of the last things we do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically putting my bags on display.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's got the Mettaners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're mixing those all throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's build-up day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no business being done today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's just building all their shit
and we're no different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're gonna go get that D-mail
though soon and bring it back down here
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be an exciting day today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been setting up with a few people,
but tomorrow, industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys will be here Saturday and
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're looking forward to seeing
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely come by the booth and say hi to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to show you the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to show you the techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got all the screens on point here
for dry sifting both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the large ones here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the bubble bags and the
Mettaners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you need to get your herb
broken up, washed, cleaned, dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got you covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: John and I are gonna finish up here and
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta medicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoke them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're gonna leave them just
sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like leaving a bong pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just reached over right there and
grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sitting there relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've got his party is going to be
at Vapor Central.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and get a ticket for that if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put mine down, but I didn't pack it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is the key with the trippy
stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people say they don't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work when you work.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you need it to work, believe me,
you can get this thing to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trippy salute.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alibaba, Luke from Paradise, and Jay from
Twister, John B.

showed up in Canada so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twister, Mettaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if it don't bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it don't bubble.

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Johnny's in there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that's going to be on expand

[SPEAKER_07]: Brief interruption there, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you got a hug?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need one of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you got six entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 10 in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a keener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going out to puff some concussion,
so we'll be back for another vid,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, anyone that wants to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that wants to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we got a little mic here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll bring it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll bring it over.
[SPEAKER_06]: See what we can get.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to show the people that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, then I got to see it next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to tune in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
Focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
It's quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolute awesome quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Astrobot from TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it myself with the inspiration of
guys like both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go first.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you know, I've been on a diet
from... Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that feel?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weed is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: V for
hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's not every day that Remo just is
your cameraman.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that little bit of bubble on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: John?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: John, he's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaporizing at the Champs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the training show cough begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't burn that herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We vape it while we're at Champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we'd be outside, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go outside if we want to smoke
joints and big smoky, fumey bowls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome hit, John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can roll a joint and go outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be acceptable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go set up our booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming by for a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're 519 right across from Ross's Gold,
right across from Serious Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come and check us out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have dry sift that we've managed to
keep in a sandy form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Traveling across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's house, I go to them like,
can I borrow your freezer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I borrow your freezer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Making room in people's freezers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a fridge in our room, and I've got
my little bit in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've kept it in powder as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pull out a piece,
sort of like a little piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next day, or maybe even half
the day, I'm going to pull out another
[SPEAKER_05]: piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then by Sunday, you'll see the
difference between sort of greasy and how
[SPEAKER_05]: it feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It presses in a quarter of a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a piece that was white, fluffy
powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just went like this and opened my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pressed and goopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like toothpaste in my fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a spig steel pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got all kinds of...
[SPEAKER_05]: Fresh frozen that we're going to like
press out into pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll press it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check us out at our booth here at 506
and 407.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see Remo walking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a booth, do you,
Remo?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green Planet's launching my product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right next to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be hanging with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find all of us very nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hope to see you all here at the
Champ Show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great time, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get Mr. Remo in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, camera person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll a joint down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mention that one more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis doesn't kill brain cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, if you're having a stroke,
it doesn't hurt as recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what it does is the cannabis helps
protect your brain cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually puts a protective coating
around it so you lessen the brain damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a tip.
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard it here first from Remo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I learned about strokes from Dr.
Allen over recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that guy's great, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I learned all about strokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, crap for us, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the giant trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you see your resin growing on the
back there on the back wall?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you grew those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize those.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got that purple look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: UBC chemo cush right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we'll get a big shot of you
under that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got something to show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got that purple to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my entry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rockstar, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockin'.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brought some purple bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should crush that over some
screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's crush the whole thing over screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say, Remo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to crush all your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you dabbing up, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a dab of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my, I believe it's the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be some Meti Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mind if I shoot a video at the same
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to turn my camera off right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you that want to watch
the continuation of this particular video,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Urban Remo channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Urban Remo channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Bobo.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a nice bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks fucking great, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've done a great job here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks great, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you with the tricone background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that tricone background because
that's truly what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we want, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a good day so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got here
[SPEAKER_04]: about five hours ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a long day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a long day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow but steady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are happening here at the Champs
Treating Yourself Cup Expo here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check it out tomorrow for businesses
if you're interested in wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check it out on Saturday and Sunday
for just the walkthrough if you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got here with John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on the eighth floor of the
Intercontinental Hotel and they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice little sort of styley little spread
here, don't they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if I can change that light a
little bit and just go... So what are
[SPEAKER_10]: these little guys?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, ahi tuna.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even notice that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some fresh fruit plate here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some hummus style, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some on... Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more true to the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got these ahi tunas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some nice fruit plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little tomato stuffed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like aubergine, almost like an
eggplant with veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a nice cheese plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemonade and cucumber water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then come back around this side.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we got?
Samosas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, and little sort of burritos.
[SPEAKER_10]: Burritos.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some kale there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all these sauces.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are sauces.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know about you, John,
but I haven't eaten breakfast or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was here for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we set up our little camera in
the corner and go have a seat right over
[SPEAKER_02]: in the corner there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're here on the eighth floor of
the Intercontinental Hotel and we showed
[SPEAKER_02]: you the little spread that they have put
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes out throughout the whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a preferred guest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got selections of the ahi tuna with
the stuffed tomatoes and hummus,
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese, and veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mini samosas, both with tamarind sauce and
with chutney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to dip in.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about you, bud?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't eaten all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: So stoked on these mini samosas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to say, Turama's treatment's
pretty good on this trip so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most excellent.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess John and I are going to finish up
our little snack here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We hit the trippy stick a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got to head over to the...
Coalition?
[SPEAKER_12]: The NMR Coalition Against Appeal.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're having a fundraiser tonight at
Maple in the Lake, so we're going to head
[SPEAKER_12]: down there after this, go upstairs,
get the detail, and head on down.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you when we get down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: John and I are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the wind taken out of our sails a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were on our way to our dinner,
or not our dinner, sorry, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: fundraiser for the NMR Coalition Against
Appeal, and we got in a cab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cab driver didn't know where it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like literally... I remember
looking at his GPS when it said he was
[SPEAKER_02]: showing Lakeshore Boulevards in New York
City, 500 miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, the 91 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 kilometers was the closest one that he
got, which is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like 23 kilometers away right now,
or 23 miles away, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we drove around for a bit,
got him to drop us off because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: insane, and now we're back at our hotel,
and John, let me load you up a bowl,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90-micron?
[SPEAKER_02]: Down here like I always do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it was a long day setting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took us seven hours to set our booth up
and see all our friends and kind of get a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of videos for you guys to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I guess right now, John and I
are just going to have a quick little rip
[SPEAKER_02]: each.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head down across the street
to Jack Aster's, go grab ourselves a bite
[SPEAKER_02]: to eat, and then we're... Yeah,
we haven't even eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought all day, I thought,
that this thing was a dinner, and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: never ate, and then we realized that about
seven o'clock as we were going to head
[SPEAKER_02]: down there, or I guess seven o'clock...
Yeah, it was eight minutes after eight
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight minutes after eight, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all these wrong times,
so... That's because you're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: your computer, and your computer says
Vancouver time, and we're in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone says Toronto time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that little hit after running around
and not being able to actually hit a
[SPEAKER_04]: D-Nail and do actually a true rip,
because we were just trying to get there,
[SPEAKER_04]: just changed everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just woke up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like, oh my gosh, I needed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's truly what medicine's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure you just witnessed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was bagged after that hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were laying on the bed 10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think you were going to move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like that cab driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just everything today, those banners,
putting up all those wicked signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that was a bit of a bummer,
and you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I follow this in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when there's events that occur
that are telling me maybe it's not right,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it's not working out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned as I get older to not force
those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it is a real bummer that we don't get
to be there for the coalition,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not going to stop us from
supporting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to stop us from asking for
support from you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to keep on fighting the
good fight here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say we go grab a bite,
and then we'll do maybe a little city,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll do some rips around outside in
downtown Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to walk across the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to walk back across the
street, do a rip, and then walk into the
[SPEAKER_04]: hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just around Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that qualify?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're going to do then.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we are, indeed,
without the tripod.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a unique way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should film in front of the
mirror all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going down fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like 12 floors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're heading up to Jack Astor's if you
guys want to join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you this late tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: This restaurant's pumping, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: It always is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was going to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go check it out outside,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to get the fresh air of walking
half a block.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the city, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really got to point the camera
straight up to catch the skyscrapers in
[SPEAKER_02]: this city.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we should have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at these two characters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here with local BC head shop owners,
Ignite, Brandon, and Rhiannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you guys going right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up there at 1540.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dab tonight in our room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Shrimp insolvent list.
[SPEAKER_11]: One hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: What number are they?
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 what?
[SPEAKER_11]: 1301.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1301.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1301.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are our friends from Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the kind of life that we live.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good folks from Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are our friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to run the CCHQ, Mark Emery's
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran it for many years, and they did a
fucking great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they got their own shop called Ignite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a couple of them in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're looking at opening another
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, they do great business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good fucking people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to dabbing with
them later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like the party's on, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we are right across the street
at Jack Aster's.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here we are at Jack Aster's.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's our dabbing park.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be dabbing over there after our
meal, potentially, although there's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: one right over here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just up here and around the corner,
there's a good little park here setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we can do an outside-inside
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the streets of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can plan to see the CN Tower in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be Toronto, so that would be
the best part about live camera work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live camera work, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do a dab in the
restaurant, but the lady that worked there
[SPEAKER_02]: honed in on us pretty quick without
pulling even out the rig or the torch and
[SPEAKER_02]: just was like, I had my ball of bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this here, this is just my
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, oh, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we familiar?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she said, oh, not in my
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that stuff in my restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to explain to her that it
would be like, seeing any medication from
[SPEAKER_02]: any person that was using any type of
medication, pills or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I explained to her that I just had it out
for a brief minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't stink up her restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, yeah, that we should be
allowed to have our medicine wherever we
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're out in front of her restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just across the street right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right within her view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope she's watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you hold that up for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe that she was actually,
she watched Bubble Mountain World.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she honed in on us right away because
she's actually watched us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a secret puffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing that she knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unbelievable that she knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't pull out the dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the pipe out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how did she know?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did she know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that hidden camera to see what you
guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are on the streets of Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Flav421 for this awesome gift
of a pipe front for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you call skill while dunking a
dab of bubble hash in Toronto while after
[SPEAKER_04]: eating you need to medicate.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_11]: You thought that was 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will dunk you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunk you, as they say in Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to turn it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you got, you need two hands to
turn this torch on.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got the wind down right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm torching it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that was a great hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's drooling in the window over
there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're about to go hang out with Brandon
and Rhiannon after this dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head up to our room and
have a little dab session with the Ignite
[SPEAKER_02]: Pet Shop owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friends.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best places I always go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to see them walking across the street
as they're going to have dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, hey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not how you turn it off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like me to do it for you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how you turn the torch off.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on the back.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll put your dome on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll dunk you belly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make you like a little bit of a,
a carbation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little pipe indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff and tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll catch you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look who stopped by.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: What time?
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought the night was over.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were supposed to bump into Brandon and
Rhiannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw them on the, on the road outside on
our way to Jack Astor's, which we thought
[SPEAKER_02]: we would do dabs inside the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the lady that runs the
restaurant honed in on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe she watched bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but she was definitely like,
she was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Oh, it's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, Oh, I don't want it in my
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just imagine I'm a diabetic and this is
insulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is my medicine and I'm not using
it in your restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just actually putting it away and
it's not stinking the restaurant up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to be able to tell people in
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just on the patio out of the
drain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut down vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one said anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I saw her looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were inside the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a blow torch and a little pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my pipe out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beside me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: The torch is sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got one of these balls up with hash
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got specks on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I actually replied, it's my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, are you familiar with bubble
hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have that in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have that in my restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, Oh, I absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't smoke in your restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went outside and smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met an incredibly kind security guard
named Cohen, who stopped and chatted with
[SPEAKER_02]: us for maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, he was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sent us to the place to buy water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent us up the street to Neil's,
the guy that runs the corner store right
[SPEAKER_02]: around the corner from Jack Astor's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was super cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be watching your guys'
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, he's watching Bulb Man's World
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you go there, when you go to the
store, which is right, you walk right to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Astor's and you turn left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go right to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see his store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just towards the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tiny corner store on the
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his name is Neil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely say hi to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super nice guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like meeting people walking around in
downtown Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we've landed, we randomly bump into
people and we're like, yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: we smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, we were on the airplane and he
was going to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: This lady sat beside me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden I started talking
about cannabis, the anal cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's coming back now.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I've now baited her.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've reeled her in, mark six down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh yeah, well, we do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of a sudden, my son smokes butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was bummed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not thinking of smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she said, I don't mind about the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems she wasn't really into the
butter thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't know exactly why.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just thought it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like, confirmation,
mom, it isn't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't like it because it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chemical exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's potentially some bad things that are
in, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We turned her on.
[SPEAKER_02]: John gave her his card and I gave her my
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully she'll be turning her son on
to water extractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part was that we got off the
plane waiting for our luggage.
[SPEAKER_04]: She came over to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this show will be getting uploaded
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one we're filming right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow's the, um, business to business
wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in a business, come by,
we'll still be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on Saturday for us, we're going to
pick a time where we're going to crush
[SPEAKER_04]: that weed over the screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some really nice jars of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: John has around the corner here that we've
showed you already.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, the watermelon astro boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be crushing that up over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll finish at four 20 and we're going to
finish at four 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's going to take a little
bit, we've got two big bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to, you know, slowly work it
with a card out, card it up nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll spend some time between one and four
20 and a four 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be hitting dabs with full milk,
watermelon dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to bring the steel bar over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a piece, a little piece of two by
four.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can heat the steel bar up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although you don't need to heat the steel
bar bar up for barb, but for the water
[SPEAKER_05]: hashes and stuff, we can heat the steel
bar up and then put it in parchment paper
[SPEAKER_05]: and we can make some super thin because
we'll have the cooler.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, I have oil slicked parchment
paper, but we can even use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen the raw parchment paper yet?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can even use these as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: On top of each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are like, uh, you can cook cookies
and stuff though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, you can press hash in these
really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally just roll over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have those like one on top of each
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put one on top of the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a great video.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're doing.
All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medley.
Medley.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like a medley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sitting over there and not getting
any of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to go over to the vape on the
lake, but I heard that the gardener is
[SPEAKER_05]: down to like one lane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a nice busy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that we're all kind of close
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, with the next one, we'll plan it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all be like, like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was like, we went for oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for watching guys.
