[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every news agency on the planet's been
through this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a story that I saw on the
internet one time, this museum in American
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest, a dinky little town.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this stake in their museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't been open for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gathered all the local dignitaries
and the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brought them all out and opened up the
safe and turned out the safe was full of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people in the room cheered and
clapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who was in the room,
but as far as I can tell in just about
[SPEAKER_00]: every scenario that you get into,
anybody speaking about something,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tell you marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody cheered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years, and certainly in this
media, they all talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of a genius Mark is with
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you a little story about
some business that we did one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not very often, and I don't think
other than this one occasion, did we ever
[SPEAKER_00]: sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they needed a pound a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could not have been sketchier or a
crazier thing for us to be doing.
