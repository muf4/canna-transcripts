[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Hell's Angel O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell's Angel Bank O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in this paper and smash it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little lemon to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Hells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to go do one quick tour of
the DNA shop here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can get a better light on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Salt CoLab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an oldie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be going back close to 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we're at the DNA shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known these cats for about 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 13 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met them at the first cannabis cup about
10 or 11 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the herb industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of DNA's trophies.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shortage of trophies these cats got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, it's time to go hit some Hell's
Angels O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bank O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.
That
[SPEAKER_01]: was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backstage, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA show.
Mine
[SPEAKER_01]: is GTFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like an Arnold Palmer,
but if you had strawberry Arnold Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like a lemon strawberry tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have
a good one.
Thanks for watching.
