[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for such a long delay in a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still have some footage from
Jamaica and a little bit of footage from
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I managed to pull off a couple
of hash churches while I was deathly ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still hear it a little bit in my
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've barely begun to puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give a shout out to our
good buddy ConcentratedX, who I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: on Hash Church last weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his logo right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that haven't seen it,
he can be found on Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you his actual address so you
can find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather you have it accurate than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's his Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's given me some really nice
kickdowns in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful cuts from DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry banana cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got some god bud that he sent to
me as well and some beautiful rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, that's not what I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the latest package
that came in from ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to photograph it,
but I thought it would be really cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you actually opening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice water extraction bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like his packaging and the way
he's put that together there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say he's got DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reserva Pravada, I believe, said it was
one of the most unique tasting sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels that he ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little bubble man on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to you ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to open that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to photograph it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to smoke it here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let everyone know how that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sent me a little god bud
flower resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic god bud flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also nice little packaging that
he's got there going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you could probably hit him
up direct for these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic pink kush flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, some bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a .5 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's his G mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made from a bubble hash mix of various of
the strains from our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: G mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% solventless extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got some nice little packaging
going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sealed it up real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm quite excited to open it up for
you here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we will do the rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what this is all about is this
sour diesel bubble hash that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get my dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always got these nicely sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always feel kind of bad that I have
to break the label to get it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like it's basically it
always looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've opened it, I haven't been able
to open it much smoother than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go for that first smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really unique bouquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like absolute fire in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you guys can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to get in there with the
macro lens in the real near future here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, does that have a really nice deep
sort of earthy fragrance going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very unique for sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I think I'm going to do is I'm
going to stop the recording here for a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick second, do some wonderful
photographing on this bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll smoke it, maybe do a melt video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll see if we have time to hit
up these rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I managed to get some really beautiful
photographs of that sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess really now it's a matter of
taking a nice rip of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely ready to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always seems even more beautiful when
things are stashed away in half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the hash for you guys to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camera's going to grab that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice smell too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a small dab because I'm
not in a position to be taking any huge
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs right now as much as I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take a nice reasonable size dab
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off some pretty darn fresh tasty quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's for you ConcentratedX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you so much for your
generosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you guys can check him out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fulfill this video with all
the macro photographs at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess there's just one thing left to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's puff this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really unique flavor to it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that's overly recognizable as a
sour diesel to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what wonderful tastes again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost reminiscent of the strawberry
banana but different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite different in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad that you're out there out east taking
care of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making up the good water hash and the good
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your generosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone enjoys this little short
video and we'll see you real soon here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly sentimental media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
