[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is indeed Puff Wednesday, but before we
get started with Puff Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been called out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been called out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to make a batch of full-melt fresh
frozen bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we have ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have ice and water in my hand,
I'm making hash, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true, this is a terrible waste of
ice, but it is for a really good cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an amazing cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little bit of research on ALS
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put into the comments of this
video where you yourself can donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gonna call three of our friends
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are calling out... Well, we're gonna
start off right now with Urban Remo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Grower Remo, we call you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also call Matt the Great Gardener out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, last but certainly not
least... DK.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K, we're calling you out for the ALS
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I are gonna do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the ice and the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to dump one on my head
first?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you taking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't fucking like even pick this
one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for D-Nail Rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refreshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cleaned your hair up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so soaked as I am, I think I'm
gonna get a rip here without too much
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also look into cannabinoid therapy
for any one of you that has been diagnosed
[SPEAKER_00]: with ALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know much about the combination of
the two, but I sure know that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, phytocannabinoids seem to
sure do a lot of good for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee it's gonna help you in some
way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll alleviate pain, help you shit
better, who knows, but it's guaranteed
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, that was our challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope the guys we called out,
you have 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
