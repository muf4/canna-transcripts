[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to puff Wednesday second Wednesday
in a row, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made it Johnny B's in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Johnny F and B for for those of you
that don't know I'm not gonna be dropping
[SPEAKER_07]: f-bombs today the way I did last episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I dropped 20 20 Well, I made a
game out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you watch the video it said take a dab
every time I say yeah, I know Okay,
[SPEAKER_07]: so today's episode is a quick it's a short
one We're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've headed down to to pork equivalent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is why I grew up actually We're
in pork equivalent right now We're about
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 minutes away from each of our houses
and the reason we came here is because I
[SPEAKER_07]: said to Johnny Is there any like hash or
solventless oil available in the legal?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know stores yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he made a few phone calls I got on
the phone and I'm like calling around and
[SPEAKER_06]: of course I called my old buddy right and
he was he was like we worked at the Green
[SPEAKER_06]: Cross Society like he's like he was the
hardcore dabber and I'm like dude I
[SPEAKER_06]: Got you we just got something like no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why I call I go I'm making
a call right now because this is this is
[SPEAKER_07]: just not That this is should we go in and
talk to them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're gonna go talk to him soon So
what I wanted to tell you guys was I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty sure it's gonna be Whistler medical
hash It's been pressed into rosin and is
[SPEAKER_07]: now a solventless oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously listen We're not gonna be
commenting too much in the store at the
[SPEAKER_07]: price because this is the legal regime.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna Be outrageous buying stuff like
this from the black market cost eighty to
[SPEAKER_07]: ninety dollars Wholesale so I can only
imagine when it's got a cost in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not gonna make it Yeah, we're not
gonna make the whole purpose of the video,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you'll be shocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll show you but yeah, we're here in
pork equivalent We've got the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: store right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the funniest thing is if Johnny moves
out of the way a little bit You'll see
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a policeman right there right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a cop parked right here So as I
pulled into the parking lot to buy some
[SPEAKER_07]: legal hash oil I see cops and I don't even
have to worry about it So this is one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the good things look John was even saying
when we got here that when he was 14 15 He
[SPEAKER_07]: used to sell herb just down the street and
I'm sure at that point in time It was
[SPEAKER_07]: scarier.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to worry about cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't want to get your shit taken
away And so this is kind of accessible to
[SPEAKER_07]: those like John and I who don't have
access to To rosin on a regular basis that
[SPEAKER_07]: now they can come and kind of get it if
they're a multi-millionaire and they can
[SPEAKER_06]: afford it Right, so we're gonna head in
I'm gonna grab the camera we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_07]: in we're gonna see you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it All right, so burp here we are
And our guest our host Welcome to burp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is beautiful Just avoid any and
all people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this looks good This looks good
[SPEAKER_05]: First time in the burp Nice man,
just taking a sick product shot Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm appreciating the cultivars and you
know that letting you know what it is and
[SPEAKER_07]: the terpene at least a couple of the
Dominant terps is usually what we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: display if something has a high percentage
I have seen a couple three terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: currants, but it's relatively rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see Just like I haven't been
in too many of the legal shops We're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do it a little differently a
little better in form they give us a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of literature to read so we know our
Terpene profiles and our strain types
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful I like these little jars and
where you get it pop a cork pop a cork and
[SPEAKER_08]: smell a smell the earth Absolutely,
they're a little bit different than your
[SPEAKER_08]: average.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've got a feathered cord to make
sure they're still secure Oh beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful Everything we keep fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna be doing some smell jar removal
today Houseplant Seth Rogen Let's see what
[SPEAKER_08]: it looks like looks pretty cushy How is it
it's decent 91 Ken dog cross Say k-47
[SPEAKER_08]: purple punch looks nice The finest flowers
I've seen yet they also do the wedding
[SPEAKER_08]: pressure of course purple punch cross
wedding cake
[SPEAKER_08]: We take pride in being the upper echelon
we're trying to provide for all those
[SPEAKER_08]: black market users that are still looking
for the quality that they're Hey Johnny
[SPEAKER_07]: come over here so I can film you guys
without getting anyone else in the
[SPEAKER_06]: background So this is what's awesome We
first met each other at a place called the
[SPEAKER_06]: Green Cross Society And what we think was
that different strains for different pages
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where I started my testing is
so really realizing how cannabis was a
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine is helping me every day with
doing the
[SPEAKER_08]: Strain specific needs now that I'm not
allowed to speak on a medical half,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we still provide that knowledge You're
clearly a connoisseur Oh chronic or 100%
[SPEAKER_06]: That by just you were explained to me that
you actually went after those connoisseur
[SPEAKER_06]: strains I can't believe the campus you
know, I've seen a lot of league we like
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been testing to solve for a year the
water to me like like I don't know the
[SPEAKER_06]: first thing you said he's like hey,
do you have any over that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, because you already knew it
was needed moisture content is Dude this
[SPEAKER_08]: frostbond still looks killer too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything by broken coast is next Level
they of course hang dry 21 day curing
[SPEAKER_08]: process.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how was it?
[SPEAKER_08]: On a bi-weekly level we want to do things
fresh yes due to BCLDB and federal and
[SPEAKER_08]: legislation and provincial legislation I
have to choose a certain camera destroy
[SPEAKER_08]: all this product the one part of my job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I must say the word hate Wrong word,
but I don't like this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it depends on what your definition
of destroy is Well mixing with kitty
[SPEAKER_06]: litter and bleach I'm gonna slowly make my
way over to the rest of these buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna keep talking We we're gonna
get to the rosin, but they've got so many
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold which came out for flowers from
Whistler the Acapulco goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some organic
[SPEAKER_06]: And just an OG you're telling me certain
things I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna buy it and that's my job is to
ensure we have the best availability for
[SPEAKER_06]: what's available these days on the Right
from leaving like we call the skills are
[SPEAKER_06]: very transferable the grain market We
didn't call it the block.
[SPEAKER_08]: We call it the grain.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It always has been I have one of these
boxes a very positive transition for us
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still educating everybody on a daily
basis providing what we call now strain
[SPEAKER_08]: specific needs different strains for
different pants Well, what what do you say
[SPEAKER_07]: we buy some live rosin there Johnny?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, I'm going all-in.

[SPEAKER_06]: I got some pine.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not the death bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the G tech the black market Okay,

[SPEAKER_08]: best flower I've seen on this market.

[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna buy it If it's quality,
I gotta buy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that's fine.

[SPEAKER_08]: be really hopefully really delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had a chance to test it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So being What's happening before anybody
else Absolutely, my job is not only

adult proof really tough packaging dope at
[SPEAKER_08]: the same time We're gonna have to take
this outside probably get those cops
[SPEAKER_07]: outside to help us too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could probably get right This one dude,
this one is next level A lot of the groups
[SPEAKER_08]: are actually focusing on the genetics but
having the tools and using the property
[SPEAKER_08]: are two different things and they do a
great curing I understand the purple
[SPEAKER_06]: punch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_06]: In the hospital Exactly exactly exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been wanting to try the purple punch
since the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm glad you're getting some Yeah,
Johnny be an angel that a lot of genetics
[SPEAKER_08]: across the purple punch now, of course
Mimosa made the best known with Clementine

[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, do you want to try some of that as
well jealous?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do wonderful and I'm gonna get the
chocolate
[SPEAKER_06]: The best thing about Roh is he knows my
flavors He knows what I like and he knows
[SPEAKER_06]: what's made me tick He's he was there when
I was the beginning when I was eating the
[SPEAKER_06]: chocolate with Dr. Hormy made when I went
in the cushions and the Concentrates and
[SPEAKER_06]: then when I started smoking the sip when I
met you we're always meeting around the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole time So he's done and knows what
kind of works for Johnny B in a way
[SPEAKER_08]: Take pride in being able to offer up the
best service we can as you'll see a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: other dispensaries Focus on having a
tablet or more working on the digital side
[SPEAKER_08]: of things where we like to work with
everyone as an individual focus on their
[SPEAKER_08]: needs directly Walking in here was just
relaxing and comfortable like a true
[SPEAKER_08]: experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I like what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the space.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely nice and big and open.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're waiting for legislation to change so
we can sell our apparel, but great things
[SPEAKER_08]: happening already in 2020.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna be a fantastic decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we start processing this year for
our company So hopefully we'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: producing some products for your shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excited about that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you guys stand for what's the upper
echelon as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really pumped for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I love hearing what he's
saying the upper echelon Like that's one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing we always talked about was having
that killer and having that that Place
[SPEAKER_06]: where you can go and get that that quality
that we've been looking for we need
[SPEAKER_06]: screaming for in the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm I can't tap it, but we'll pull out
the card.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going for the big car.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just gonna go
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever you're ready gentlemen should be
prompted for you there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's your cannabis test Yes,
the excise number very important with
[SPEAKER_07]: everything We'll have to pull those off
maybe really nicely John and I got about
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 or 40 of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send it to a skunk man Sam He wants
perfect ones in the very beginning from
[SPEAKER_07]: each province.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Manitoba so far from here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like a bag?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will love a bag It wasn't packaged very
long ago, so it's definitely that's what
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really really
[SPEAKER_06]: With the flame We're gonna find somewhere
that's legal for us to use this We're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to his house Okay, so I can return
this if I don't like it or no,
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't like it No, but if it's
substandard with the problem, of course,
[SPEAKER_08]: we can damn we don't have no John Perfect,
but I think you'll be very pleased with
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me and I already know I'm gonna
be for the first readily available
[SPEAKER_08]: Concentrated extraction on the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a double number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you really appreciate it All right,
Johnny B, let's get this hat let's get
[SPEAKER_07]: this party started well, we're back and
John's buying more stuff I had to get
[SPEAKER_07]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a tweet chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me check this out Indica cannabis
infused milk chocolate I'm all about the
[SPEAKER_08]: animals He's gonna call me now In the burb
throwing out the cash now, you don't see
[SPEAKER_06]: this this much this is very rare
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I appreciated the chocolate that I ate
markets dosage I am fine in the
[SPEAKER_08]: nanotechnology especially the beverage
lines becoming readily available the
[SPEAKER_08]: emulsification program the way it mixes
with our own bloodstream and our
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid system I make it that the
10 will be more like a 30 to 40 milligram
[SPEAKER_08]: the people are used to it that they've
been told the 40 milligrams so sure just
[SPEAKER_07]: wait until it when you When those
companies move away from liposome based
[SPEAKER_07]: technology and they get into mesial Which
is just a different structure of
[SPEAKER_07]: surfactant that goes around the molecule.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even more bioavailable It's actually
kind of frightening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's why it would be fine with 10
milligram doses People just don't
[SPEAKER_07]: understand how efficient we're about to
get They're eating like thousand milligram
[SPEAKER_07]: chocolate bars that maybe aren't really
decarb decarb properly They're not really
[SPEAKER_07]: like the most bioavailable and they think
Like you should try like a hundred or
[SPEAKER_08]: fifty milligrams of just something that's
actually been properly You know what a
[SPEAKER_06]: high-end chocolate bar cost you 25 so
infused chocolate for under 10 How many
[SPEAKER_06]: mgs, I don't know 100 total or something
So I'm gonna have to eat a lot of sugar
[SPEAKER_08]: you are sugar-free xylitol when becoming
available over the month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I gotta come back
[SPEAKER_07]: And there goes the man All right,
so we are back now if you can't really
[SPEAKER_07]: tell we're at the world famous cactus club
cafe Yeah, this is one of our favorite
[SPEAKER_07]: restaurants, but we're right, you know
because of this ridiculous scenario in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada where you can buy Cannabis you just
can't fucking do it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't smoke it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: No So you're legally allowed to smoke it
where people are allowed to smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be good It's over 10 feet away
from the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a little table here set up I got
the temp tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the mother shit Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open our rosin Are you gonna need to
crack that if you want?
[SPEAKER_07]: Crack that You go there you go,
oh we're saving
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this this is cool show that to
the camera up close Okay, so here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna press the side and it's gonna
slide open so really up close like show So
[SPEAKER_07]: there's the case now this stays in there
stays in the case It doesn't come out of
[SPEAKER_07]: the case for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this is just some
hilarious ridiculous scenario I was told
[SPEAKER_07]: he goes he's like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just turned it Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it turn if you're turning it to come
on?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing this together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it opening though?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it opening?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll let Johnny deal with it and
then I'll give him a hand if he needs
[SPEAKER_06]: Please keep jar Affected within the box
push down and twist open That's doable you
[SPEAKER_07]: can do that and I hear it work dead So
that you smell that dude, that's fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's straight fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually pretty surprised that I smelt
it right away I'm actually pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: surprised that the beautiful color is a
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God Let's get you what you've got
the dapper there Looks great Surprising
[SPEAKER_07]: actually, we're impressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get a picture with my camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're both taking pictures That's a
free matches Like that that's that's he's
[SPEAKER_06]: got the iPhone 11 so it's definitely got
better pictures
[SPEAKER_07]: Great go ahead Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fix Do it this way maybe so we're
on the camera like you can take your
[SPEAKER_07]: picture, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you see I've got the problem Because
of all right, let's do this 763 750
[SPEAKER_07]: These hitting reps you're the first legal
rosin in Canada
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen two people so happy
like the smiles on your face I'm waiting
[SPEAKER_06]: for you to tell me what it was like Okay,
so that's the flavor What culture are we
[SPEAKER_06]: hitting here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tasting a little bit of that But they
must sell it as a cultivar don't they
[SPEAKER_07]: solvent free full spectrum cannabis
extract I taste I taste I taste don't
[SPEAKER_06]: mention it right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god I taste a new can in there and
something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the flavor that I'm getting right
now Well, I'm about to join you and see
[SPEAKER_07]: what kind of flavor I can get off Oh,
look at that bottom rocket Just getting
[SPEAKER_06]: that happening is the hard part it is it
doesn't have a lot of no You expect you
[SPEAKER_07]: like it almost like an oil Well,
I mean this isn't oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't I just didn't I didn't really
know what I Expected I've told that it
[SPEAKER_07]: would be something that because it was you
know fairly expensive that it would be
[SPEAKER_07]: something that we were still actually
wanting to smoke and happy with and I I
[SPEAKER_07]: trusted your friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've known him for a long time He's not
just trying to make a sale and if he says
[SPEAKER_07]: it was fire I was like, okay, it's fire,
but I I didn't know if it was gonna be
[SPEAKER_06]: fire and he's like right away when I call
these like dude you guys are gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: The color looks great the flavor is there
the taste is there I'm definitely gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: have to double down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm gonna double down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't take a huge I didn't want It's
like see he's about ready to get just a
[SPEAKER_06]: hit of his life from legal I mean not the
hit of his life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna be afraid that to be able to try
something he's ever tried for which is
[SPEAKER_06]: legal Whistler Mountain bubble Which was
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, that's yeah, that's dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's all in part because you said dad
we get out on camera now it was dank like
[SPEAKER_07]: One more for Johnny B one more bubble be
So, yeah, that's kind of wild
[SPEAKER_07]: Now There's always gonna be a division is
it extremely expensive, of course it is
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we gonna hope and and and make sure
that things become less expensive?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not ideal for people I
mean don't get me wrong right now The
[SPEAKER_07]: black market price of rosin is really too
expensive for most people to purchase it
[SPEAKER_07]: between 50 and 80 dollars a gram There's
not a flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Yeah, yeah, but there's hash rosin
as well for those prices But it's still
[SPEAKER_07]: you can get it is what I'm saying Yeah,
and what I'm saying is it's not super
[SPEAKER_07]: affordable for people to be able to buy
that We'd love to see it at $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was this was almost $200 a gram But
we did it for a video.
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted to see a what was available be I
gotta say It's definitely great rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean this rosin will get you lit time
and time again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure you know I won't be going and
paying $200 a gram for every gram of rosin
[SPEAKER_07]: I spend that's absolutely outrageous,
but You can't blame the store.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can blame the government and you can
blame the system that's in place right
[SPEAKER_07]: now, but the bottom line is Being able to
walk into a store like that and pick and
[SPEAKER_07]: choose your edible your flower and your
solventless hash oil to me was a pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: cool experience and I'm glad that we got
to do it Johnny
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell the camera what's the I said says
here it says total THC 650.7 mg total THC
[SPEAKER_06]: 650 70 THC Five five point five point
three milligrams I'm kind of curious
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little warmer of a temperature
maybe a little bit hotter I like I like a
[SPEAKER_07]: hot down then we're gonna take you guys
into the Cactus Club and we're gonna eat
[SPEAKER_07]: probably won't be able to film too much
But we'll show you guys the food if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: from BC or anywhere in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's there's a bunch of these places
across Canada I think Manitoba Toronto and
[SPEAKER_07]: Calgary Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want to go
maybe around seven?
[SPEAKER_07]: 710 is always used to be my favorite but
680 seems to be the one that's well By the
[SPEAKER_07]: time you put that in and it says 7 to see
how fast it's dropping.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're already at 690 It drops fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go to Johnny B Hitting that dab
Like he should be Dude, I'm super
[SPEAKER_07]: surprised at the quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm upset with the price, but I'm pretty
stoked on the fucking quality You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's crazy That you could just buy like
