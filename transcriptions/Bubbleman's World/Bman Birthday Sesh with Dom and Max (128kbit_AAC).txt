[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do a video, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to set it away or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that goes under there like that,
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here with Max and Dom from the
Sunrise Wellness Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is my Earth Strong, my 44th
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they happened to pop over for a little
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, I guess you were, was it you
cleaning the dry sift off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I cleaned up some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Teflon and then brought over some more
09 cookies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, two cultivars that I have had only
from these gentlemen in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: both the 09 and the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had another Wi-Fi 43 or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DHN's Platinum Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wi-Fi 43.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was proper too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Sasquatch guys,
by the way, for sending all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: little dab mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handy little dab mats for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a birthday sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm guessing that's Matt and Joel
that put that in there or Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I guess we were just going to
sit around, have a little sesh,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit about this sift that Dom
was playing around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the sift that's on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the pine tar Kush from Johnny B
that I cleaned I guess last week or the
[SPEAKER_01]: week before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, let's have a couple
of bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press out a little of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lovely when it just presses in your
finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
Proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know it's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a little overdressed now that it's
getting nicer out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I've got to put the big jacket
on, get the hip on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's getting warmer and I'll maybe be
taking it off in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the near future, I'm going to start
this party off with a little turp dip as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of just sitting around
talking about hash, getting lit and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about potentially a terpene party
actually, something that I'd been thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about for the last little while through
one with Tony in Barcelona, I guess a year
[SPEAKER_01]: and a bit ago now, the first terpene party
that we threw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Karma's bitch is what's going down
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this glass to move, move this over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice size dab of the pine tar Kush and
yeah, Karma's bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll really change the effects of this
sort of narcotic and heavy, strong,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what you'd call the indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard not to make that sound after a
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: How tasty was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like what we were talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential gathering, the blue river
gathering it terpenes can really can
[SPEAKER_01]: change the way you gather and puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I like the micro dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the many different colors,
flavors, vibrant flavors coming off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a different vibe throughout
the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I felt like in Barcelona anyway,
that I went for four hours straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't make it out there this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at La Colada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just clean this up for you there,
Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already way dirtier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to go turped up, turped up,
turped it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just do like a little dip too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find, cause if you do too big of one,
it ends up kind of overpowering it and you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really get the best, the best of the
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's better just to kind
of do a moderate one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really get like, more than enough
flavoring just with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I even, you know, went as far as
saying that it also felt more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_01]: often when I took much smaller dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then I, you know,
I could also almost like the way I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: people drinking wine throughout an
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just go and go and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, the people I was
puffing with could go and go and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I can go and go and go
regardless of what's being puffed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the rest of the people that tend
to, um, just get burned out, get tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really conducive to hanging
out with people in the evening,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the city, the way you went
for a concert or any other type of
gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all this stuff moving around on
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like musical cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a delicious dab though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of like a cherry taste from
the Karma's bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that RD one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a dip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you dipped?
[SPEAKER_01]: I dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed your dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite the dipper Max is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a ninja dipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, potentially we were talking
about, well, you guys have two locations
[SPEAKER_01]: for sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one on Broadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got our newer one, which we've had
open for a couple of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're on Kingsway,
Kingsway and Rupert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently it's a good size space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been there yet, but we were
talking about the potential on throwing,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, a gathering of, of Charisi
people, a blue river event, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: A private party where we really promote
the use of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can come in with their different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll have distillate companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll have hash companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just to be able to try the
different terpenes with the different
[SPEAKER_01]: products, you know, in a setting that's
sort of a little bit different from your
[SPEAKER_01]: average gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people, for instance, have not tried
15 different cultivars of terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout an evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that might seem to be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, like, I mean, we have a shop
that carries all the different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, even we, like, I personally
haven't even tried as many as I do when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when we actually get more of a
chance to sit down and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just like, it's not,
it's not something that, um, that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily go, Oh, Hey, I'm going to buy
at, you know, at that, yeah, 10 of them at
[SPEAKER_02]: that retail and be able to afford to just
try them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this gives people a huge
opportunity to really get like a taste of
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavors that there may be wondering
what they're like, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to kind of get into,
but wouldn't normally be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, you know, for a gathering like
that, I like the idea of having really
[SPEAKER_01]: good food and really nice fruit and
juices, you know, being able to give them
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice t-shirt at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have something to take home with
them to be able to try a dozen plus
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some live music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are in BC, yeah, come check
Vancouver in particular, right in the
[SPEAKER_01]: comment section, what you would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a little terpene event at the sunrise
wellness foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely, uh, I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a, that was a Karma's bish
that we just did there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pull out Jack Frost,
you just don't put it back without.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's hard to keep that one in my
stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Jack Clouseau from West coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try a little Jack Clouseau.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pink kush cross pink kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Louise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky you didn't get that in the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so lucky that's stayed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting at about minus one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the hash is really, real explosive
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was expecting it to do that,
but not with such ferocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jack Frost was my original first
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jack Frost that we hit with the master
scout rosin was like psychotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it was the first real
synergistic hit that I had of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was next level, but it was not just
dipping some hash in a little liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ever changing until this one's well
used because the colors changed on it.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably that color because of this,
if you hold it up with a different
[SPEAKER_01]: background, it might be more yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been dipping a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it looks like the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, yeah, definitely pulls the color from
the seats though as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that taste good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that's, that was the Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell of that is unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a jock with a Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack jock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually gonna get you one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, listen, that was beyond nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for you next to hit it and
try to play it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's not everything that I just said
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because holes might be easier for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might just have to, the best way is
you almost have to, it was the best route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warming up with your hands a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your thumb over top of the thing when
you're cracking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise that shit comes out 60 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get like your like hand right in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ro had a vial of the strawberry banana
from concentrated X that was like in this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge glass vial like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like all of it was in the
bottom melted into a puddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, do you want to try to get some
out of there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just smash the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Frost is about to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how good that tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's everything good about cannabis
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's exhilarating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, um, it wakes you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the taste is still so
strong on my lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cross on Jack Frost again?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd have to look it up to not
get it wrong, but it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely one of the, the Jack career.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Block cleaners the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's also got the Jack's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what he thinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how delicious that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sapphire is no joke either.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is a preserver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the life preserver, the turf
preserver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's off the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's off the charts, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a flavor explosion just happened
in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would like to say that is
important is that it's so on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing fake or weird about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing overwhelming about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just super on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are levels to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been like three minutes since I got
mine and I can still taste it on my lips
[SPEAKER_01]: and my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I exhaled it, I was in shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize how ridiculously awesome
Jack Frost is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, I truly didn't like,
you know, I didn't have it in my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost easier not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't have it in your personal
stash, it's like, you can't be knowing how
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome that is and then go to work and be
like, fuck, I need to buy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To tell you the truth, I don't think I
ever really was using it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about little dabs with a little
bit of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's the equivalent of you just got
turned on to putting pasta sauce on your
[SPEAKER_01]: pasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it doesn't mean you won't
go back and have some pasta sauce or pasta
[SPEAKER_01]: without pasta sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people say, do you put it on every
dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't put it on every dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I remember I have it and it's
right there, does it go on a dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes the experience too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can just noticeably feel the
different effect coming from it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pure, it doesn't have a weird,
like something different vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like you can, you, you feel that it's
coming from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like your body knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp Reborn here today on... How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack's Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the... It takes you a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't answer that question anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out pretty like, like you don't
taste it the second you blow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, to me, it was like
limes and lemons and like fucking just
[SPEAKER_01]: like...
[SPEAKER_02]: And like bits of grapefruit almost in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intense grapefruit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodness, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the Terps too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue River Extracts.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Americans, BlueRiverExtracts.ca
and locally in Vancouver, Sunrise
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the exclusive Blue River Terpene
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to order from the
computer, you want to go in and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: people and maybe, I don't know,
you guys probably aren't opening them and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting people smell each flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to leave them sealed for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're paying premium for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do get to... You get the service
when you come down, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to pick the one you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not subject to UPS or Canada Post or...
They actually have so much smell too that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can kind of smell just by cracking the
bag without even opening the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, smelling too is not to test
these by any means because the smell and
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor, although they do sometimes
line up, they do not always line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jack Frost is a really good example
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely different from when you
smell it to when you taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty drippy actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one should we dip into?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one should we dip into next,
fellas?
[SPEAKER_01]: God, was that good?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what was good when you're
thinking about doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a sound and play like a song on
the radio that they really like and at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the song, the DJ will just cut it
and turn that song on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Lemon Tree also has wow factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Tree has wow factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of Clementine Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like a little bit of a cherry
Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony's been cleaning up with that
Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just won another gold drop Clementine
vape pen for first prize at Hemcon or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely some good flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't mind getting that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to have another rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing next?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Teflon was the sift that I cleaned
up just using plain old static tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it to about maybe like a 95,
90 because we were going to press it into
[SPEAKER_00]: some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the West Coast guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it puff as just the pure dry sift?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't super melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been meltier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very close.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you unveil things, sometimes they're
not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like maybe a little bit more carbon
in the trichome than what's necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I'd rather press it into a
rosin, have it melt really nicely,
[SPEAKER_00]: get all that flavor and no char.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to do that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even more than that, I'd rather the
grower be aware that they didn't grow six
[SPEAKER_01]: star and that we made the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them and say, listen, if you did this
properly, it would be like this over here
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's like the often the path
that people don't want to take that path
[SPEAKER_01]: of being like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like super, super great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just, it wasn't, it might be a
few things you want to pay attention to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe a cultivar change for
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always looks, you know,
and things can always be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been open to suggestions
because everyone's a student and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still learning no matter how many cups you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was real nice too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clementine's another like, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for skiing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite as like, not quite as loud as
the Jack Frost, but just still very much
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good birthday dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wanting to come up here and have
some dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you guys made it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can keep here, whatever ones you decide
to take nice and clean for now,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than full of oil circles before you
get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should give a couple of these away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how or why, or what,
what, what can we come up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone answers in the comment box,
how many grams of sift is in that jar?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess how many grams of sift is in this
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can guess, put your number in the
comment section and I will mail you one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't know if it'll be this one
exactly because I'm going to give one each
[SPEAKER_01]: to Dom and Max, but there'll be four left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really leaves four chances to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll take, uh, the two closest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take the four, the three closest and
the number that gets it, or just the four
[SPEAKER_01]: closest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nobody gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone gets it right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess the amount of hash in this,
uh, in this jar guys and put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get yourself a fine
Sasquatch Rosin Dab Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for glass glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who doesn't like free shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a clementine dab and the sun comes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's, uh, delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three big rippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to lay back and relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take my jacket off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say it was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the, on the verge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we do end up throwing this party,
we will let you guys know through social
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your guys' social medias that
they can hit up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Sunrise Wellness Foundation 4.0 and
Sunrise Dot Wellness for the product
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks that people try to get,
and you know what the worst thing when you
[SPEAKER_01]: say in this industry, it's not Instagram,
it's people in this industry getting other
[SPEAKER_01]: people shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, yeah, that's the other
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sun's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, we've covered most of our
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few really good birthday dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some good birthday dabs and,
uh, yeah, we're going to keep it short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for watching Bubble Man's
World.
