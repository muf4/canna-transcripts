[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just simply put we're gonna keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna do a little wet washing We're
gonna run a set of the bubble bag
[SPEAKER_03]: originals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some fresh ice I've got some
chilled water down here and I have two
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh frozen Piece of ice kind of trick me
out there for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll just keep that ice Smells
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got some fresh frozen Astro boy,
and I'll come up And show you what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dealing with here Let's see if we
can get this to focus on that camera for
[SPEAKER_03]: you good Really really nice nuggets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear jibs telling me break those
down a little bit more bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry jibber I'm breaking these down
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is extremely frozen material.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in the freezer for a couple
weeks now And it's a good amount,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is actually a couple of
plants this time so could be anywhere from
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 to 60 grams of dry plant matter nothing
nothing monstrous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just growing small plants But it
should be a nice amount to run for a batch
[SPEAKER_03]: of There's actually some substantial
amount of nuggets here So just a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling out a bag So just a matter of
pulling out The bag that we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: mix in of course last time you may have
seen that I have the standard barrel
[SPEAKER_03]: shaped Which was a design we came up with
quite some time ago in conjunction or not
[SPEAKER_03]: conjunction, but in sort of After the
pyramid design which was designed by Acme
[SPEAKER_03]: my manufacturer He came up with along with
our help the design of two other bags So I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we're gonna go with this one today
Can't believe how sticky my fingers are
[SPEAKER_03]: from touching this bud right here so Let
us tease part of me wants to use the
[SPEAKER_03]: barrel shaped as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go Let's just do it a bunch of this
bud in here and get this washed This is
[SPEAKER_03]: just like top grade, but as good as the
material gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it right here Perfect size
material a couple of the buds are a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit big and once I get them all in here If
I don't drop them all on the floor prior I
[SPEAKER_03]: see Get back into this and break up some
of those flowers that are a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: larger than they need to be Careful Do not
let this I am kind of insane You know I do
[SPEAKER_03]: this so you guys can see I do it so you
can enjoy the view But ideally you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be doing this out in the Sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I'm rushing It's why I'm working
very fast if I was in a cooler environment
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lab setting I could have up by lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean a hash lab by no means is that on
par with an analytical lab
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, nice big nuggets in here getting
broken down into popcorn size They're rock
[SPEAKER_03]: hard nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is part of the the real enjoyment
tears feeling how hard these nugs are even
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Sun And although they are getting a
little bit sticky now just on my fingers
[SPEAKER_03]: So be a real joy to run so well Ice cubes
never a shortage of ice cubes when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: running bubble please use as much as you
can This is a mixture of homemade ice and
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of store-bought ice but the
homemade ice is Gnarly solid sharp little
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces that I jaggedly There's an enormous
amounts of these pieces of ice These are
[SPEAKER_03]: very effective ice cubes when it comes to
fresh frozen I find I love the density of
[SPEAKER_03]: any type of Dark ice that is opaque and
can't really see through it not quite
[SPEAKER_03]: clear, but more cloudy Get that done up
Sit that there and we will load up our
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble now with some chilled water This
out of the way All right, so nice chilled
[SPEAKER_03]: water This water is probably a solid four
degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean cold And so we'll drop that in top
of there All right top that up a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit Okay Simply put It's really all she
wrote guys It is that easy make sure when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're starting that your nozzle your
drain is attached I mean you want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that even before you pour the water
in obviously I'm gonna go for probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: six minute run on this batch
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys the bubble now literally
just finished mixing it mixed for about
[SPEAKER_03]: six minutes and No time like the present
to get the resin Out of the water and how
[SPEAKER_03]: do we do that we start by draining the
resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the bag sitting down here below.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gravity fed unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So gravity works in your favor here once
again It is the gravity that's helping you
[SPEAKER_03]: separate the resin glands from the rest of
the material by the resin being so dense
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still affected by gravity in the
water while everything else of course is
[SPEAKER_03]: not buoyant it floats This is part of the
magic of water extraction so Not only am I
[SPEAKER_03]: going to filter That material through but
I'll also use a Little bit more water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still got a little bit of cooled
water here, but fill this up Never a bad
[SPEAKER_03]: idea Get a little bit of water in the face
ballpark parcel Here we go a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: more We will of course do a second batch
and What I'll be doing almost ASAP is
[SPEAKER_03]: taking this material getting it into the
freezer So that's done
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Get this guy freezer Pass this
on to my assistant All right, so we get
[SPEAKER_03]: the bubble now off the table Get it into
the shade Because we will be running it
[SPEAKER_03]: again It's ideal if it's not sitting in
the Sun I'll probably run the second patch
[SPEAKER_03]: ASAP so Get this guy up here I'm gonna do
one bag at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my tools and a bunch of ice here
keeping the ice cool for when we get to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Microplaning or the dry sieving I
should say All right, lots of contaminants
[SPEAKER_03]: in this bag Leaf and such that managed to
get through The bag well so Pull up my
[SPEAKER_03]: spoon Just sitting here completely covered
in ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How awesome is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know your spoon is cold when?
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome Back up and Not using the spray
bottle today could have I suppose but Just
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna do a real real quick Extraction
today here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not messing around Usually John and
I are giving you guys full explanations on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything Sirens in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope it's not for me Make sure you get
these bags very very clean It's an
[SPEAKER_03]: important part of the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to crimp out on the bags
And properly dried This is the first thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that will wreak havoc to your bags putting
them away dirty All right, very small
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of 190
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't expecting I probably ran a total of
60 grams Through the bags in that throat
[SPEAKER_03]: in that frozen bud that you saw there's
just two plants my plants aren't huge They
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have much over 30
[SPEAKER_03]: See in the pattern here Keep the resin
cold and get it collected before it heats
[SPEAKER_03]: up on the screen It picks up just
perfectly Perfect Help
[SPEAKER_03]: with the bucket is I can't say enough
about it to help this little sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble bucket thing is your tool to help
you Is definitely going to come in handy?
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt about it All right, let's start
getting into some smokables here Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: nice nice to see a little bit of 120 It's
nice to have that little Bit of water in
[SPEAKER_03]: there it really allows the resident to
come off properly without grinding into
[SPEAKER_03]: the screen This resin is saveable we'll
wash the resin on this bag the 120
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice that it's such a hot day that this is
enjoyable To have the water All right the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90 I always like to see a little bit come
out of this bag I like the way it's
[SPEAKER_03]: holding the water unlike the other bags
Bad sign anyone that's made a lot of water
[SPEAKER_03]: house knows that when you pull that bag
and it doesn't release That's generally a
[SPEAKER_03]: better sign than not Of course,
we're using just baby amounts here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you the amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want it to sink And show you these
huge pulls which I can do with 20 gallon
[SPEAKER_03]: bags no problem But I'm trying to show you
guys what it looks like if you run a small
[SPEAKER_03]: plant from your crop There we go beautiful
90 micron just a little pile no really
[SPEAKER_03]: probably no more than a gram But quality
of this gram or two Will be extremely good
[SPEAKER_03]: in fact this one I Will choose to see
almost immediately The other ones are
[SPEAKER_03]: still what wet and watery so that's good
Don't want to let this resin deceive you
[SPEAKER_03]: it will stick You would not believe
particularly if you get it warm Right now
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very cold in this bucket,
so it comes off real nice If I sat this
[SPEAKER_03]: bag out for any amount of time in this
heat If you give you an idea, it's not an
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely hot day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about
[SPEAKER_03]: That's holding pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty greasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it in the shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit cold
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do the 73 and then we'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, we're left with a nice little
pile Just
[SPEAKER_03]: blowing the foam off of it so you guys can
see what we got there nice little pile of
[SPEAKER_03]: 73 And the water present really makes it
easy to scoop it off and to place it back
[SPEAKER_03]: on the screen All right, so rinse that in
there rinse this in here Make sure that 73
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket is rinsed so easy to make the
mistake on getting over excited That you
[SPEAKER_03]: forget about your dirty bag Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we're gonna take the bubble that we've
taken so far that we've pulled We're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it inside with you guys,
and we're gonna show the sieving process
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come out and pull the last two bags,
and then we'll do the sieving on that And
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be done one more video on how to
make your own water extracted resin Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I've got my pizza boxes all set up my
190 through 160 my 120 my 90 73 my 45 and
[SPEAKER_03]: my 25 I'm usually able to make do with
these Size boxes because I'm running
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller batches the resin still nice and
wet so I'm not overly worried about it the
[SPEAKER_03]: strainer The strainer is sitting in ice a
Nice big amount of ice to sit the strainer
[SPEAKER_03]: in so that when we get to that it's cold
I'm gonna grab the spoon and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: start straining Okay, so we are going to
scoop out the 70th or the 90 I should say
[SPEAKER_03]: it's Just that perfect flakiness right now
comes off On the spoon nice you get our
[SPEAKER_03]: strainer out And then we will start
straining this gummy goopy resin through
[SPEAKER_02]: here Well that's definitely not working
that gummed up worse than anything I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever seen All right, so we had a major
upset the resin gummed up worse than We
[SPEAKER_03]: thought so what we're gonna do is when
this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was a little deceiving We will
still collect the resin nothing is lost
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will let this dry by micro planing
it And this is a great thing about micro
[SPEAKER_03]: planing and how it can sort of back you up
So we will freeze the resin we so far have
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're going for the first
Freezer method you can see I basically
[SPEAKER_03]: pushed half a gram of that resin into the
strainer no loss This resin will dry
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly I will allow it to spread
throughout the strip the screen and it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: just crack off once I've heated it once
I've warmed it up so No worries on that it
[SPEAKER_03]: won't be lost, but definitely I'm sure
many people have seen this sort of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: and thought oh my god I fucked myself you
did not it's a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunate move, but it'll come Off it'll
dry and it'll crack right off beautifully
[SPEAKER_03]: so nothing lost We'll be back in a bit
once we've got this ready to Microplane
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that stuff was a little
stickier than I anticipated it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: Acquire a microplane of course I'm in too
hot of an environment too So these are the
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of mistakes that you'll come up
with if you work in too hot of an
[SPEAKER_03]: environment So it's great to show you guys
this because I know sometimes people are
[SPEAKER_03]: completely baffled and confused how these
things can happen to them Here we go nice
[SPEAKER_03]: big 45 pull on that astro boy covered up
the screen real nice so More gooey gooey
[SPEAKER_03]: gooey resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we got to do with this we
get it off We collect it Coming off real
[SPEAKER_03]: nice and then get it frozen for
microplaning really nice pile of 45
[SPEAKER_03]: micronite Easily three grams just on that
So it's good I'm sure you know last time I
[SPEAKER_03]: was getting four four to five grams off my
yields and I think because I used Twice
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount this time that we're gonna see
twice the return Always
[SPEAKER_03]: easier to get the resin off when it's a
bit wet particularly if it's cold as well
[SPEAKER_03]: always have your Your most reasonable time
with your resin when it's a little wet as
[SPEAKER_03]: that moisture gets out of it And it starts
drying and spreading out Then you can run
[SPEAKER_03]: into problems So you want to keep it off
your fingers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it moist keep it wet even if you got
to dip your hand in the water every once
[SPEAKER_03]: in a while
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent excellent all right nice pile of
45 in that 45 bag real quick
[SPEAKER_03]: Last for a nicer setup for cleaning
perfect 25 micron always slow to drain We
[SPEAKER_03]: do this tell me it takes some hours to
drain their 25 micron bag and I Have to
[SPEAKER_03]: shake my head a little bit at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I'm sure if you stood here like
this it would take hours, but Why would
[SPEAKER_03]: you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the air to force the screen you
don't squeeze the screen don't bruise the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit Remember who used to say that but
for some reason I think it's someone So I
[SPEAKER_03]: won't bring any more of that up 25 micron
is decent Also covering the screen much
[SPEAKER_03]: like 45 Never quite as blonde never quite
as clean looking, but this is pretty nice
[SPEAKER_03]: looking 25 spoonful and a half anyway I
Guess that's what they meant by 11
[SPEAKER_03]: spoonful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean isn't that 11 spoonful right there
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we've got our Turpene rich water
and that's something I'd really like to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk a little bit about How do we get
these terpenes out of this water?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we do it without heating up the
water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will affect the actual terpenes and
produce what is called an artifact over a
[SPEAKER_03]: true molecule?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to recapture these terpenes and I
want to hear what you guys have to say
[SPEAKER_03]: about that I know they have different
machines at Eden labs that you can use for
[SPEAKER_03]: these sort of different Processes that are
done to essential oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about it, but I'd love
to hear from you people that do know a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: about it You know something that's not
distillation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to heat up the water too much
I'm not sure I want to evaporate the water
[SPEAKER_03]: there's got to be a way to trap these
terpenes that are in this water and
[SPEAKER_03]: Rebring them back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a future in that and It's
something that I'm putting my focuses on
[SPEAKER_03]: so I wanted to share it with you guys This
bubble needs to get into the freezer ASAP
[SPEAKER_03]: as it's sitting out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looking The birds want it,
can you hear them?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like give me that bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me that bubble Anyway, I'm gonna get
this into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back in a little bit
and microplane the whole batch It's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be a tough one because it is sticky icky,
but we'll get it done We'll see you in a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute All right guys it is the next day
my Planer has been in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a little piece of 120 here,
and we're just gonna We're just gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: shave her down There's
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny little pieces, but with this planer
that I've got I have to say it's called
[SPEAKER_03]: the micro planer That's it just a straight
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a very very small bump It doesn't
have very harsh holes on it and because of
[SPEAKER_03]: it you can actually Plane without planing
your finger off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually quite nice All right,
so a little bit of chunkage here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but 120 breaking up just starting to get
sticky on my fingers The next step We have
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 73 we have 90 So we're gonna have to
grab that box or 73 I should send it
[SPEAKER_03]: already done the 90 that's right 73 So
we'll grab the 73 micro plan All
[SPEAKER_01]: right nice little piece of 73 I'm just
gonna grind that down on the old micro
[SPEAKER_01]: planer It's gonna get gummy, so we got to
work fast
[SPEAKER_03]: The joy about this is especially with the
metal micro planer So you can release all
[SPEAKER_03]: that sticky resin This one's releasing
quite nicely due to the fact that it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of moisture I'm gonna put
this back in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna come back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna do this last little chunk All
right, so we got the last little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: this frozen bubble I
[SPEAKER_01]: almost need a new planer as mine is coming
up good Coming up with that at 90 micron
[SPEAKER_04]: love And what a great problem to have
right a little bit of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: gummy bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: a Bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah a little bit on the bottom you can
hear it just Hitting that parchment paper
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely Awesome You can just bang it hang
it through at the one hand and then flick
[SPEAKER_03]: it off with the scissors So there are a
little bit of chunks here, but because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so fresh What I'll be doing with
those chunks is I'll just be giving them a
[SPEAKER_03]: small amount of time probably less than
six hours and Then they will get They will
[SPEAKER_03]: get reapplied broken up a little more for
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a pretty nice even texture on that
90 micron There's none left so What we do
[SPEAKER_03]: is We shut the box and this is one of the
great things about the pizza box people
[SPEAKER_03]: have been laughing about them for years
You know you get certain guys thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: it's fail tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it's not fail tech at all I say
that once you've lined the box with your
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment paper You're covered with
worrying about any type of fibers that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could possibly get from the box Plus you
get the box closing it closes right over
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash so you can avoid paper You can so
you can avoid dust and debris and animal
[SPEAKER_03]: hairs Basically keep your hash nice and
clean so easy to transport to once you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got that you can just kind of take it
right over I've got my 120 and my 73 We're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna do up the 40 45 next so also if you
get yourself some hash on your fingers
[SPEAKER_04]: like this Right real nice easy way to take
it off is with a dabber Now the trick Is
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to get it off that clean Is to
heat up the dabber just a tiny little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: With your torch or with a lighter and
basically you'll get those fingers Clean
[SPEAKER_04]: as a whistle and you'll get your bubble
Ready to smoke And you'll get your bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: off your hands Just another tip from the
bubble man Alright so a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_03]: pass I've left the 45 and the 25 frozen in
the freezer They're right here freshly out
[SPEAKER_03]: you can hear How completely frozen that is
I'm gonna be using a different Plane this
[SPEAKER_03]: is more of a grater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my plane here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten it quite dirty so I'm planning
on using this this time around So let me
[SPEAKER_01]: know how that works in about a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh nice Wow just planning super nice
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaking it down into pieces that first
little bit was going on ice These little
[SPEAKER_01]: chunks off later here
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaving nicely This is exceptional quality
No doubt about it
[SPEAKER_03]: So Getting quite a bit of chunks,
but I can break it down further
[SPEAKER_01]: He's off to the side a little bit come
back at them Half gram or gram of larger
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces There oh I got away lucky I think
with that that is a nice nice plane
[SPEAKER_03]: Able to sort of push this through the
holes It's actually planning quite nicely
[SPEAKER_03]: right now This is actually usually a
cheese grater.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first time I've ever used this
particular style, but The holes are sharp
[SPEAKER_03]: enough that it's It's giving me a decent A
decent plane on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean really the whole purpose is to
break your Your hash up and get that
[SPEAKER_03]: surface area That's really what you're
looking for not leaving it in chunks It's
[SPEAKER_03]: always easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna lie You know once again even
this could be made easier if I were simply
[SPEAKER_03]: in a colder environment Even the warmth
from this environment right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably around 70 degrees Just warm
enough to cause more of a problem and then
[SPEAKER_03]: create a help So that's perfect And this
was the 45 micron so that's done What I
[SPEAKER_03]: like to do once I'm done is I like to shut
that up You can see a cat just jumped into
[SPEAKER_03]: the view here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's cat hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's dog hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other people there's debris and
Dust in the airs that just float around so
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to cover my shit up and so that's
why the box so That one's done Last one on
[SPEAKER_01]: the It's 25
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I gently rub it off the pressing
screen here?
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I use Is the one that I'll
usually break up often by hand the 25
[SPEAKER_03]: micron I find mostly because it's a
medible Also that because of the heads are
[SPEAKER_03]: so small I find it's the one that seems to
be able to dry Properly without the help
[SPEAKER_03]: of being completely powderized every
single time and it's sort of one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons sometimes people Wonder well,
you know like they they see the 25 micron
[SPEAKER_03]: dry and they figure well they should it
all it should all be a Like that and
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately, it's not like that I think
the 25 micron dries like that because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the smaller heads And if you put a lot of
small balls in the bowl, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: the smaller they are the less Space
they'll be between them and the larger
[SPEAKER_03]: they are the more space they'll be between
them So the way I look at it is the larger
[SPEAKER_03]: heads are allowing more water to get
trapped in there taking a longer time to
[SPEAKER_03]: dry and The smaller heads are leaving
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the 25 Micron Boom two boxes
done.
