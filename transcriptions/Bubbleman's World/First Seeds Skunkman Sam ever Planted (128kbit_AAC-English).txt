[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a short story and that was the
first, it's kind of music related.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first seed I ever planted was in 1965
in Hollywood at Sunset and Vine in Wallach
[SPEAKER_00]: Music City's flower box outside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody knows of Wallach
Music City used to be before Tower
[SPEAKER_00]: Records.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coolest place to buy music,
at least in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just grew Mexican seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they weren't nothing super
special, but they got a foot or two tall
[SPEAKER_00]: before either the gardener cut them down
or one of the people that were hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sunset Boulevard spotted them and
harvested them for the revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, the music I was
actually listening to at that time was
[SPEAKER_00]: people like Buffalo Springfield,
Jefferson Airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the music that I liked back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I moved to Santa Cruz in 1972,
a few years later, we were able to see Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Marley played at the Santa Cruz Civic
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went and saw him both times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time we had our daughter with
us, she was only two or three years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Santa Cruz Civic used to be my
favorite place to go see music because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was small, maybe at the most one or two
thousand people fit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw so much good music there,
you know, a lot of reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first two times I saw Bob
Marley was there also, which was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bootleg copy of that 1972 show in
the Santa Cruz Civic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a local guy here on the west side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 78 in July and 79 for the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw him the second time,
he was he did not have the energy left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could tell something was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A place of legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Civic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Willie Nelson there to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if it was it's not quite
where it used to be in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, though, there's there's a lot
of good energy in that space, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only reason I left was because
the state and federal government were
[SPEAKER_00]: flying airplanes and looking for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got out of Dodge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen eighty five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting pretty bad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
