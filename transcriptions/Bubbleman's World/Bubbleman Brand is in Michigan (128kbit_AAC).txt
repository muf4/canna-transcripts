[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Michigan, we're bringing my hash hits
and more BC Bubble Man products to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary near you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for staying tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Marcus Richardson, aka the
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been into the cannabis
industry since I was about 15 or 16 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was deeply involved with the hemp
growing legally for the first time in my
[SPEAKER_00]: province of Manitoba back in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to British Columbia in 96 and
became an integral part of the BC
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassion Club through growing and
providing and procuring cannabis for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was around 1998 that I ended up
getting into a little bit of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that trouble, funny enough,
led me into the wonderful world of bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really most excitingly are these
Bubble Man brand deals that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key factor for me is finding an
incredible hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with Michigan, it was no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reached out to by a gentleman by the
name of Papa Sift, aka Ryan Wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just checked all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A true bubble ambassador, a true lover of
the art form of hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he reached out to me and he connected
me with this amazing group of gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers from Michigan called
Roll-Ganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it just, everything fit like a
beautiful glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everyone, it's Papa Sift here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check out where we make all the BC
Bubble Man products here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing solvent lists for like
since 2009, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing it at scale for since
like 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I just had a strong grasp of
running a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had experience running a BHL lab at
a different facility in Jackson,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of all translated and was
able to pull together and run a small crew
[SPEAKER_01]: over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to go to Jamaica Cannabis Cup
in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the first international
cannabis cup down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a mutual friend linked us up and it
was cool to go meet him and pick his
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to just go there to meet
people like Marcus and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I wanted to just network with
and see if I could figure out how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun kind of managing that and
trying to break through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa Sift is really second to none.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the Bubble Man brand to survive
and to succeed, that is a major important
[SPEAKER_00]: factor in moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to give a huge shout out to
Papa Sift following the Bubble Man SOPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating his own SOPs that he learned
over the years from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done many, many, many FaceTime hash
making sessions with our Osprey,
[SPEAKER_00]: with our Hashtec, with our Rosin presses
from decarboxylating materials using the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample automation Rosin reactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it we've done closely together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just got to give a huge shout out
and a thank you to Papa Sift for sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: putting all of this together with the
Bubble Man brand and Rollganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: BC Bubble Man has been the brains of the
operation and I'm the hands carrying it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does have very precise SOPs to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're trying to do certain higher
end SKUs, it has to be pretty specific on
[SPEAKER_01]: how he wants things followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the SKU, we'll do three to
six washes and we'll start off with very
[SPEAKER_01]: gentle agitation and slowly ramp up
agitation just to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting everything off and not leaving any
meat on the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be remiss as well if I didn't
mention the live hash vapes that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be releasing with the Kung Fu
vapes in the Michigan market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been testing a whole variety of vape
hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really like the Kung Fu disposable units.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be live hash Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products always of course take,
you got to grow exceptional cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it with consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it hopefully regeneratively
and sustainably so you can keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course a really important
factor as well is making sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the right hash maker for the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got the Kung Fu vapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a nice airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It preheats every time you turn it on and
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it never gets like stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty smooth experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the 73, 90, and 120U of the
strawberry lemonade that I'm washing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get different flavor profiles from
each bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed more of a creamier one for the
higher micron bags and more of a fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor for the 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BC Bubble Man products are going to be
something new to the Michigan market and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really excited to bring them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these hash hits are Dry Sift from BC
Bubble Man Techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're disposable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five come in a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 0.2 each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each pack has a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically by like volume per weight,
one of these is equivalent to a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our first batch here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty excited to get these on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got the test results back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first drop and the strain is
soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Royal Gannet crew is incredible and
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been the perfect partners growing
17 acres of incredibly organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, sustainable cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really paying attention to the SOPs in
regards to how they harvest, how they
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain fresh frozen from literally the
time that the plant is cut down right up
[SPEAKER_00]: until the time that we're processing the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been incredible in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't imagine a better partnership
and we're really looking for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in regards to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for conscious owners,
people that want to get their customers
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the best that they can depending
on where they fit into the SKUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I say the best, the best
could be a hash hit for one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be full melt Dry Sift for another
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really speaking about the
quality as much as what is the best fit
[SPEAKER_00]: for the customer in regards to the price
point, THC percentage and volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feel that that might be you guys
and that's one of what's sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mission behind your group in Michigan,
we would love to hear from you.
