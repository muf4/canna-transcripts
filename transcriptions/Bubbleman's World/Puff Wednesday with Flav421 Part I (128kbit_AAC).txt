[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got down to the CCHQ, the Vapor
Lounge on the top floor, Mark Emery's
[SPEAKER_02]: headquarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to meet Flav421, but I figured I'd
take you guys through a little walk
[SPEAKER_02]: through, through the Vapor Lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you walk in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually there's a nice girl to greet you
and say, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few little products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the old cover to the book,
Chris Bennett's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Bob Marley Roach Art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done with roaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really got to be impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Cheech and Mark guitars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, this is my guitar, Chong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the day that he showed up to be
receiving this guitar, Jody and him
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out on the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly could never forget Michelle
Rainey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really awesome friend and an awesome
activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: We miss you, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you watching?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flav, he's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Pelicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that Pelican.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Flav has just shown up here
at the CCHQ and he's brought some glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one will be nice out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Octopus and the Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix, Marcel Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't puffed that in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you brought?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flav Egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Flav Egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, you got the nice Pelicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got those fancy, fancy ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_02]: 30K?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has opals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's air trapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every single Ratticello has an air
bubble perfectly trapped on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opals are like perfectly round too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys ready to rip that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the most beautiful opal
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is way tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flav, are you going to get in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: 710 on the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought the fatties too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So geez, mine's got the D-mail on it but I
want to get one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we should probably first blaze
the girls down the board here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one's that Andre?
Whatever you want to start with.
They were really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well why don't we give it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll invite one over and we'll say,
hey, I'm going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: First up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, I see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your special seat so you're on
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one would you like to hit first?
[SPEAKER_04]: You called it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because it's the pipe that he loves
the most too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool on a multitude of levels,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got here, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Food melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the food melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that what you left in my house,
by the way, in that weird thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit it and John was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird when you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Marcel Scott egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no mothership markings on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, why does this one hit so
much better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just because it's Marcel Scott or is
it a psychological thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's the actual egg, the diameter
of the egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very small chamber, so it gives a
much more enjoyable toke, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a mega bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, for me, it's the energy of
the two artists, of Scott and Marcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a side thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a carved cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only $8,000 for that carved cap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true art.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use more of the pointy dabber
this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little bit more art coming off in
my hair.
It's just like that sticky hat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bucket's a little old-fashioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love the bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to call someone else over to
hit the fab egg and call you back when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's Phoenix time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the name of that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I see that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's his entry for the school going
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus.
Marcus Chase.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks different color every time I look
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's because he knows how to fire
a dichro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it really bright and doesn't burn
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easily burnt out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitting fat glass with melty hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Such nice hash and such nice glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no doubt about those eggs
hitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, all the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll have you back for the Phoenix
in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was hoping maybe you guys would
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your name again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan, look at that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I also run a store advisory a lot
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Store advisory?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super bubbly melty.
Did you guys have some?
Yeah, we brought in three.
Three or two?
Two.
Two?
Two.
D1's going to give me another one.
I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually puffed out of that pipe in
Amsterdam when it had never been broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had never been sold or bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still like the glass floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone had brought it up for him,
I believe, because he wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember taking a picture of it and
then literally hearing that a little while
[SPEAKER_02]: later that it didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the fuck?
I heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, a new install.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself some of the old stuff that's
on there.
I'm like, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the MKUltra.
Yeah, it's nice, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a video yesterday talking about the
difference between drying hash and curing
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The importance of drying hash in order to
cure hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't cure undried hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are things going down at the store?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got some good sales going on that
you want to tell my audience about?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is on sale right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't really have a sale right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys still have those Bacos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they have a song going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole shipment of clouds are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check out the Apex yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, nice mothership sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the beginning of Puff
Wednesday for Flav and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be heading to his house
after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a little sesh in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head out to my neck of the
woods and jump on the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to try and get maybe this
Phoenix Marcel piece with the octopus
[SPEAKER_02]: spelt on the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be a nice piece to have on
the water?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I concur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be a nice piece to rip right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Duncan Chainsons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that smell amazing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ass or boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting on the seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you, Katie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me and Megan are both on Valentine's
Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next one?
[SPEAKER_03]: This place has been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you've been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let her hit this ass with
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to drop you in a nice breath
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fresh-frozen astro boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to taste so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not only important to share your
genetics, but it's good to share your
[SPEAKER_02]: hash, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just share your whole experience with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, experiencing good things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clean this dabber real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't even flinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know why it was a solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the right sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the right sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have the sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sound where energy is released in a
place it's not supposed to be released,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is more of a tink than a clunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that little tink?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all sadly experienced that sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the things that we can
talk about in the wonderfulness of
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership that I really appreciate about
their pipes is the thick bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thick, thick, flat, non-beveled,
non-rounded, like flat, thick base.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that is a testament for the
strength of these pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go around the base of this right
now, and it feels perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Security.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel the ridges almost of the,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to put it down where it's
going to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no rocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I only have the one myself,
but it has a pretty big base for a
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have a really wide base.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the widest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay attention when I put my Mothership
down, not for my Mothership, but for other
[SPEAKER_02]: things on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, if I put this down on any other
type of glass, this, goodbye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would break so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured yesterday when I was talking
about Hash 101, I found one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that made that video interesting was that
we spoke about the effects that Hash 101
[SPEAKER_02]: really tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I thought the important thing that
we can talk about with your glass is the
[SPEAKER_02]: functionality of it along with the art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the functionality of how it
sucks, but holding it in your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like the artists consider,
like Marcel always considers, so I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have felt some big pieces out there
where it's almost as though the artist
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't considering that someone would have
to actually potentially hold the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all those pieces with like giant
spikes sticking out of them, like even I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple touros with giant spikes,
a couple quarries with big long spikes and
[SPEAKER_01]: twists, and it makes it very difficult to
hold some of the pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a quarry tube, and it's a
beautiful tube, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a gift from my wife for Father's
Day a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: A gift from his wife for Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Flav gets for Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it had almost what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got like twisting flame spikes
coming up the side of the entire structure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pipe, so it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to hold on to the flames
themselves, and I had one friend hold onto
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and you could see it in his hand as he
was gripping it so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to make him put it down because I
was worried the relationship would snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I mean, there's definitely a
level of functionality both in not just
[SPEAKER_01]: the perk and the tip-toke it gives,
but also in the way it feels and feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually one thing I do love
about like pretty much anything from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mothership crew, like anything Dosa does,
anything Scott and Jake do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just feels right in your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: To access those lines, whatever those
lines are on like a nice car like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the base, like you can grip it
here like nice and solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice and solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice feel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a lighter and V-line?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a lighter too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's a lighter with a V-line on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's getting invited over first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my fresh frozen at 0.90
microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only got probably three grams of it
total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think it took me, you know,
I grew it 60 days ago or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me 60 days or 90 days to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a long time in the making to
produce resin of such quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely melting away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, will he finish the bowl?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really going to have to push it close
to burning his fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's a champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pushes through since I can do that with
him standing on my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Telling you man, that was right down to
the wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so, you can all taste what I'm
tasting and see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why, like I, maybe I just
like to be a humble dude, but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think I did anything special to grow this
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it in a pro mix with a cocoa fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flushed it for 40, 42 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that was maybe one of the
things I did that was a little excessive
[SPEAKER_02]: to some, but yeah, I just, I turned all
the bud and the trim and the herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of it into the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took the band-leaves off,
separated them out and just saw it and ran
[SPEAKER_02]: all the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many people have hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like that on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should all have that.
We should.
Yes, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real, not pretty strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know, like a lot of the TGA
strains produce really, really fine resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, it is without a shadow of
a doubt with higher end on the map with
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always those strains, jacks,
leaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher end, aka bad boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who popped the, the Astro
Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bred the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Apollo 13 male that he was
hitting something else with, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen got into the rune of Ortega's cross
with C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Ortega C99 cross got smacked with
the male pollen on the Apollo 13 and that
[SPEAKER_02]: is the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also very commonly known as watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The true watermelon.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's such a good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want another tote?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know,
actually, I actually sadly bought it.
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's from all the underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got keys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good teamwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we're popping on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to be down at Mission today
at the Pacific Northwest Garden Supplies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I went down to Johnny B's and he had
already left and I couldn't find it on
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready for another riff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turned out to be a beautiful sunny day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and hit and break glass,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always scared to lose the next glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: No part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely an old school bubbler that
you really have to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old school, love the can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is a 90's style bubbler that
Marcel just took to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: A straight flattened out bottom of the
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcel does these huge cans that are like,
you don't even realize there's like half a
[SPEAKER_02]: liter of water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would not be a cup of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The base is, isn't it smooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's easily a half liter in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you like to taste on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some new hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That literally is eight days old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a baby, that hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the Marcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a humble guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how little he puts his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally, that's so Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few people that I know that
are as socially conscious and unified in
[SPEAKER_01]: their, the way that they feel about their
friends, the world, and how incorporated
[SPEAKER_01]: they are for everybody and how powerful
they are for the greater good as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to just a single individual.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel is, he's a real inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who's next up?
[SPEAKER_02]: She went down to the other floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they, I guess they opened the lower
floor later than the upper floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, supposed to be down at that
garden supply thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up not making it, got lost in
Abbotsford, drove an hour and a half to
[SPEAKER_02]: get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was committed and woke up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: The attempt was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for Marcel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for Marcel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this piece I don't bring out
very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually only me and Eric,
me and the wife are enjoying ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to watch other people actually hit it
and be able to see the chamber and the
[SPEAKER_01]: wings and the head all full of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually rarely get to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait until you have it on the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm telling you, when we can't get
it on the boat and it's just water
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounding us and we snap some killer
pictures, it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy to share some of the perks of
this job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you seen degenerate art?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put it on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if you have Netflix,
watch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you guys have Netflix,
you should watch that at one point in
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Degenerate art.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good friend of mine who did that.
Degenerate art.
Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit this up one more time.
Oh,
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got something.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save that for the pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
