[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting here with D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just bumped into each other a little
while ago here in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a good trip, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent trip, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent food, excellent smoke,
excellent ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wolfed down sushi cones,
ahi tuna tacos, and some stringy french
[SPEAKER_02]: fry things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking awesome french fries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like french fries a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those french fries, I'll travel
through those french fries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at the top of the list,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our little hit man, little baby
cakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a couple of different torches and
some dry sift that both of us made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figured it might not be a full
episode, but in the least, we'll fill a
[SPEAKER_02]: little session with you guys out on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go grab your pipes and your hash and
your dabbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready to go, because we're making this
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got about 25 seconds to get it ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that's generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get smoke on time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, that is generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's, you know, it's polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one almost looks like it needs gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a bottle of butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the bike too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up a little roar from you,
from your shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little mini hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it out to the collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: on all the YouTube occasions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that dab barely fits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to force it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the coalition for the
repeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the MMAR program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to see Remo and Jason Wilcox and Anne
Gedeve and John Berfellow and a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: good, good crew was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your dab ready, mister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, I could have it ready pretty darn
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the trick now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tiny little pipe so you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: today, yesterday, day before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably do it tonight too, later on,
because I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I hit a vapor lounge,
Eden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Chance and I went in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually, we actually did some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab to the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab to the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was neat was you just literally pull
yourself right up to the bar there and you
[SPEAKER_01]: see you ordered, like you ordered a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom, they're doing the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running the torch, they're running
the dab, or they're running the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the most optimal toque you can
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was impressed with the whole situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd actually go back there again and I
liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice to have a city that,
you know, we've got our, our compassion
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs, which are very serious,
sort of almost medical establishments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our vapor lounges, which are
really just like anyone can kind of go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay your five bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have your combination club dash
vapor lounge, like what Darren's talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, where you would require to show a
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just, they won't just dab anyone
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very cool that these things exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have anomalies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice it's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have anomalies like mega ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these guys that are like Mark
the weed guy who's literally selling
[SPEAKER_02]: medicated pizza and medicated,
medicated treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there's a company in Vancouver
called fusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also now doing it or infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll write it in the comments
section because I don't want to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: name wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see it starting to blow up
here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: For how advanced Vancouver was in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like it really took a slow pace
in this last decade of not really in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, it was really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's when I was coming down and
you, you know, and we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always smoking and stuff,
but we're never, we're never, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, openly like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do this at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, you know, it was,
it was, it wasn't, it wasn't, I don't give
[SPEAKER_01]: a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not stupidly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice that we can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not offending anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not throwing anyone's day off and in
no shape or form to Darren and I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to look around all rubber necked,
worrying about, you know, any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: police or security or any type of actually
take a look at the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you look back at this
video, look to see if we were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it one time at the start of the
video when the Harley drove by and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: went like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you're on a bike and you
hear a bike, you're looking at the bikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at bikes even when I'm not on a
bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of loving it, you know,
dirt bikes, fucking crotch rockets,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even some of those fucking spider
three wheelers are pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two, two wheels in the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that thing for a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not buy one, but you know,
I'm wondering if those wheels go like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are taking like a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally, I know they turn like
this, but do they, when you, will they
[SPEAKER_01]: lean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if you went around a corner fast
enough, it's hard to say though,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it really is going to offset.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I really want to know, I could just
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure someone's gone like 130 miles an
hour.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the fucking spider articulate?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of you out there know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm looking forward to driving
through Stanley park right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you guys want to come through
Stanley park.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful park that we have here in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll strap the GoPro on the front of the
bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually on the front of me, I don't have
a bike strap for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to look through my visor like
last time, but yeah, we could rip around
[SPEAKER_02]: the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get to the highway and split ways if you
want to, or no, you're heading back this
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to head back this way buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quick this way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go through the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren's going to go back his way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll link up tomorrow for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we might have a late night
session, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to say goodbye to you then
my brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you either later or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to take these guys for a
little ride through Stanley park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace guys.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you bro.
Good
to see you too.
Good to see you too.
Good to see you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you too.
Good to see you too.
