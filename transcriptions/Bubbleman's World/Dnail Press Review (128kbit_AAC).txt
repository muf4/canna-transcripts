[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and today I'm pretty excited to be
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing to you a little bit of a review
on the brand new D-Nail press,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosin Press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they basically, this is their beta
test, their first batch out the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they made only a hundred units.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took an already existing t-shirt
press, which you might very well
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plates are five by five, so five
inches by five inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really, really well-made little
unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could pick these t-shirt
presses up, I think, for pretty much three
[SPEAKER_03]: or four hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is exactly the price D-Nail is
selling it for as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: 350 US dollars on pre-order at D-Nail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably only about 40 left,
so I jump on those quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see, unlike a regular t-shirt
press, which would just have the one heat
[SPEAKER_03]: press that heats up one plate,
the other plate stays cool, what we know
[SPEAKER_03]: from Rosin and guys like Soil Grown,
who really forwarded and started this
[SPEAKER_03]: excitement up on Instagram when he first
squished a bud, we know that both plates
[SPEAKER_03]: being hot are pretty essential for the
process to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So D-Nail added a second controller.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are D-Nail units inside,
and basically it's just like a D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You turn that thing on, you turn that
thing on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it set on Celsius, so I'm looking
to press around 200, 212 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: Fahrenheit today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the highest temperature, not the
lowest, but somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I can go around 150 to 180 and
still, you know, potentially preserve more
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I can go a little warmer,
upwards of 250 degrees, and really make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure I get every last drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of coming at you guys from the
middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get your own press, by all means,
play with every temperature and every
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right off the bat, one of the things I'll
tell you when you get this unit is there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a big knob on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This knob, when loosened, allows this to
move on the wheel, and it also lifts and
[SPEAKER_03]: separates the plates higher apart from one
another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you first get it, they're going to
have it set so when you've got this all
[SPEAKER_03]: the way closed, and you put this all the
way down, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't go any further.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a bunch of press here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to turn the unit because it's
quite a bit of pressure on these springs
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've put on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what you have to do is you have to
undo the top one from its little unit
[SPEAKER_03]: right here, which is a super simple twist,
and then unplug its four pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it plugged in for now because
it's heating up, but what you do is once
[SPEAKER_03]: you unplug that is you can actually spin
this top lever, this top plate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and bring it down lower to create more
pressure in your clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to get this thing into
position just so I can actually show you
[SPEAKER_03]: the pressure that it takes to close this
particular one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not a ton of pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say that's nowhere near the 1,500
pounds per pressure that it's apparently
[SPEAKER_03]: able to take, but I'm sure it's some
hundreds, if not close to 800 to 900
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds of pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I could spin that plate even
more and make it even harder, but be
[SPEAKER_03]: careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you close these four springs down and
it really grabs, the unit can jump a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit, or when you go to lift it up,
it can really pop up with some serious
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay within your safety zone,
especially if you're a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to be hurting yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be extremely careful of these plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they start to heat up, the whole thing
is going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even up here will get hot eventually,
so that's why they've got the big caution
[SPEAKER_03]: hot surface sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not touch the plates with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to keep your hands away, even from the
outside of the top plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about after having it on for
quite some time, as I like to leave mine
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are up to 100 degrees set on the
temperature, so they've both gone up to
[SPEAKER_03]: about 110, 115, and I'll just wait a few
minutes for that to drop, as that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit warmer of a temperature than I
want to rock right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I had them closed for a while
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we'll discuss what we're going
to be pressing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never go back to the hair
straightener, I'll tell you that much
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing is a done deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great for getting us through the
door, but the press, even if they made a
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller version, like a little tiny
version, which I think D-nail's coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: with, that'll blow away any hair
straightener as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice to be able to close it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like to use my ear and get close to
it as I'm closing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the five to ten seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of me wants to let it sit longer
the way Jeff Church, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: reverend, I always noticed he would leave
it at eight plus seconds, whereas other
[SPEAKER_03]: people would pop it open at five.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going to be a personal issue of
whether, where people, much like a nail,
[SPEAKER_03]: heating up a nail and having people tell
you that it's too hot, even if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoying it or telling you that it's not
hot enough because they don't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pressing will be no different.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you over press, you will overheat up
the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far from the bud rosin that I've done,
it's come out very, very light,
[SPEAKER_03]: even when I've left it for ten plus
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I am going at a lower temperature,
100 degrees Celsius, which is only 212.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the nub really squeezes out
beautifully, the hash squeezes out even
[SPEAKER_03]: nicer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suggest, let me look at some rosin
real quick while we're...
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made these just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made this first one, which is very much
like a shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very glossy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not snappy in the sense that it just
breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I tapped it with my finger,
it would absolutely just shatter and
[SPEAKER_03]: break, and I can break a piece off like
that, and it's just extremely stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when I broke it off, it made this
beautiful little snapping sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this rosin I made from this bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this bubble is about a four-star
bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Melts pretty good, definitely doesn't
disappear to nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells and tastes great, smokes great,
and no surprise there that it produced a
[SPEAKER_03]: really beautiful quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I took some of this three-star bubble
that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this bubble was a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was grown nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I believe, an outdoor crop of a
variety of Breeder Steve strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not what you would call a four
or a five or even a six-star.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just a three-star because of
its melt factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it has a great taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very aromatic when I open it,
but people aren't excited because it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: really adaptable product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pressed out some of that yesterday,
and we got an absolutely beautiful product
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll show that close up on the camera
later as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that came from this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really see now this isn't just
putting lipstick on a pig and prettying it
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're doing is we're extracting the
oils that are present in these thick wax
[SPEAKER_03]: membranes, and we're extracting and
pressing those oils out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it's doing really is it's
unveiling, much like bubble bags unveiled
[SPEAKER_03]: quality when it decontaminated resin
heads, this is now unveiling quality
[SPEAKER_03]: that's hidden amongst a shitty grown
trichome head or a wax membrane that was
[SPEAKER_03]: too thick or something that infected it,
that the resin itself, there's still a
[SPEAKER_03]: quality in there once you decontaminate it
further.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really proof of that because
I'll tell you, anyone that smokes this and
[SPEAKER_03]: then smokes this, I mean, it's easily a
three to seven-star jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just, I was playing around and I
pressed some for a friend yesterday as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just another little pile of
that beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it around and show you, a little
piece of the parchment on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the same stuff, just really
golden and aromatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the hit of those breeder steam
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there's sweet tooth in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be blockhead, maybe a little
grapefruit, really a nice combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: the smells there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the rosin just made it
absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put those there at the front on
display.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I say, why don't we press up a
little something or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we start with a bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really easy process here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been using these raws that Horatio
Delbert left for me, which I got to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, like thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize how essential and
awesome that would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So breaking off a small square of the
parchment paper, you can also use oil
[SPEAKER_03]: slick if you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now people are going to have issues with
both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using this unbleached, the best
possible stuff that I could personally
[SPEAKER_03]: find.
[SPEAKER_03]: But who's to tell me that in a year,
someone's not going to find out that
[SPEAKER_03]: something went into making this that isn't
ideal to be heated up and transferred to
[SPEAKER_03]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I urge you all to constantly think
about these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use just any old material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get to the pressing screens
that we're going to talk to about when
[SPEAKER_03]: filtering the hash, I really want to make
sure you guys don't cut corners on these
[SPEAKER_03]: particular things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the best parchment you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbleached is ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well, get the heat pressure,
heat stamp, authenticated pressing
[SPEAKER_03]: screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want something that goes at least
to a 300 degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would want to stay a good 100
degrees under that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, the oil slick pad,
I believe goes to 500 degrees,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, you'd have to contact them
to make sure of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I snapped off a little square,
I bent it in half, I've got a tiny little
[SPEAKER_03]: nut nugget that was left over from Glenn
at the My, sorry, Your Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Dispensary in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I urge you guys to go check out their
Facebook page and give them any support
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a lot of problems with the
city of Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a lot of problems with the
Winnipeg police.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need support.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously the people in Winnipeg are
no more or no less deserving to have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to good clean medicine at a good
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than the people of British Columbia and we
have over 100 of these in our cities ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to regulate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got this down to a little over
100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to put this on there nice
and gently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to do a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use my ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop that open after ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like it's squeezed out a decent
amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a huge amount, but definitely a small
amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come show you guys there in the
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of see the derbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that'll probably just squeeze out
to a dab, but there very well may be a rip
[SPEAKER_03]: left in that bud as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little bit bigger than what I
normally do and it seems like there might
[SPEAKER_03]: be still a little bit on the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could give it another press.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why don't we collect what was there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just used a dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got this beautiful little wooden dabber
from the good folks at D-Mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean out the tiny little bits and pieces
of the herb that you see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Takes not too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then gently scrape it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is already shattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already flipping and falling apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flicking and got to be careful with
collecting of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have found that it's almost easier to
rub this stuff off the parchment,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Church style.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of his sort of techniques that
he showed me originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't always use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more of a tap and lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for certain resins, I find that the
technique that he was using was definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: on point for efficiency and just overall
ease to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is like really beautiful
colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's probably going to be a
good idea for us to get a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to pick it all up off the
parchment right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some on the dabber here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Area to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by hand, it's just, it becomes even
more difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, this is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's been collected, you can see that
it's pretty much a clear white substance
[SPEAKER_02]: that we squeezed off the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we'll take one more shot and then
we'll take the dab and then we'll get back
[SPEAKER_02]: to more pressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: More pressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, caught it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh dab of what I believe was called
grape God out of the sick nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things I've found about the
unit to be extremely convenient having it
[SPEAKER_03]: here just in the last couple of days is
that I can find nuggets of things that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown or gifts that I've been given
that I don't really, I'm not that often
[SPEAKER_03]: into vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to be really much more into dabbing
these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to be able to just take a flavor
and press it through the machine for eight
[SPEAKER_03]: to 10 seconds and be able to squeeze out a
dab or two dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some of the Congolese squeeze out
almost three dabs for one small bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did bring a few other buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we could go through just as a
sort of test.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a gift from Horatio as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe this is the silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a nice little sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower off one of these little buds here
and just put that right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to reuse the same
parchment, even though there was a tiny
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of resin still in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not overly worried about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a thing called the pre-squish
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a soil grown talk about it with
some other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done it most every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mention it now because I just put this
bud in and actually didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it a little bit easier to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really at one point in time with
your ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it's sizzling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I'll show you this little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little super silver haze bud squeezed
out a little bit more than the last one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little collection of resin on the
plate there on the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that the bud itself,
I usually just pull it right out while
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes off real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if other people have a
different technique, if they're letting it
[SPEAKER_03]: dry or what not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's all sorts of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure a lot of different people are
going to come up with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways to tell you how to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to give my own honest
little opinion and review on this machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is enough bud collecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wanted to do real quickly was show
you guys a collection, collecting using a
[SPEAKER_03]: pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually cut a piece of this
pressing screen down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll just go like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make a nice little envelope with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple like that, like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close it on both ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, put maybe a gram or two of hash
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to press it through the
machine here and show you guys what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like to press hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start with the better stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well do a little bit of each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is bone bone dry and has really
congealed itself into this Tupperware
[SPEAKER_03]: container.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to use my scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go by eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you from this stuff,
as I have already done it, this stuff here
[SPEAKER_03]: will yield 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff, which I thought was only
yielding about 33%, I squeezed it a few
[SPEAKER_03]: more times and actually brought that up to
about a 45%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is almost giving 50% as this is
giving easily 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never even gone back to repress
this because I was so happy with the 50,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly because it's, like I said,
it's really only a four star.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting that 50% is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's throw a bunch of hash in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I just did this yesterday and weighed
it out quite a bit, quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to guess that I'll probably
be pretty accurate with a couple of grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably be left with a gram
patty of hash afterwards and a gram of
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another thing that I noticed was I used
a few screens that were dirty that had
[SPEAKER_03]: these oil marks in them from rolling the
ball and doing it with the hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I found was I took one of those
screens and I wrapped it up like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first press I put it through the
D-nail press, the thing basically cleaned
[SPEAKER_03]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could put a little bit more in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm way low.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically just folding it up like a
joint upon itself and folding it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of doing the ball technique
that people are doing, I've kind of grown
[SPEAKER_03]: accustomed to this tube or rectangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely leaks very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this piece, what I'm actually going
to use is a larger piece of parchment that
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled off yesterday when I was doing
this very same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just gives more room for the oil to
press out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little bit easier for me to
load as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, three, four, six, seven, eight,
nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I usually do with this now is I
take it and put it in the freezer just for
[SPEAKER_03]: a quick shot, let it harden up,
open it up and collect the resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then repress again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This should be usually able to open it
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the resin will stay on one
side of the parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's just a matter of collecting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I lift out gently.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pouch in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of resin is going to always
sort of stick to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get that in the next press
because we're definitely not done pressing
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just collecting with this,
really simply, I just gently collect it
[SPEAKER_03]: upon itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm going to make sure that my
piece is absolutely as clean as a whistle
[SPEAKER_03]: because I did dig it around in that hash
and there's a bunch of little grains of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash remnants on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we'll collect it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and tappy, tacky, very sort of sappy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first, if you're using a tool like
this, is you don't want to tear through
[SPEAKER_03]: the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have to kind of gently pull
the stuff off the top by collecting it
[SPEAKER_03]: basically with itself, as mostly anyone
that's collected this resin, for a short
[SPEAKER_03]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: has learned that it becomes very easy to
collect when you use the rosin itself and
[SPEAKER_03]: not the actual tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that takes getting some on your
tool first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice press here, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice press.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get larger amounts, it becomes
even easier, in my opinion, because it
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just rolls right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just collecting upon itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have some photos that I'll share with
you that are of basically this exact hash
[SPEAKER_03]: pressed and rolled through yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way I don't have to spend most of the
time in this video re-photographing the
[SPEAKER_03]: resin for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while we're talking about this,
I can show you what this resin is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: look like, or at least what it looked
exactly like yesterday in the photos that
[SPEAKER_03]: I took.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that the honeycombing
effect is very pronounced and very strong
[SPEAKER_03]: as it boils out of the pressing screen and
out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really get this shatter-like honeycomb
look to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a pretty cool effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself am glad that I really just stuck
with my guns and my belief systems that I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't want to do solvent extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I waited all these years for
all these people enjoying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel what I'm happy to say that for
the last 10 to 15 years, I haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: inhaling solvent extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that's, you know,
in hoping that the person that is making
[SPEAKER_03]: them is doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've got a nice little ball right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I did get my scale, so even
though we didn't weigh it at the start,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can weigh it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little tear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about .5, just for those out in
YouTube land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love how the resin just literally
will pull right off the stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little dab right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is .9 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let us press it again and see what we
can squeeze out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At about the seven second mark there,
I could hear it starting to sizzle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sizzled out a little bit,
but certainly nowhere near what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably .1 or .2, which will bring
this up to a little over a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll open that up and we'll see
what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'd also like to press some of this
hash for you guys, just to see a different
[SPEAKER_03]: press in effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to put quite as much in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we can actually use the parchment
paper that I've already pulled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do like a gram or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the ease and the
wonderfulness of this unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you can just sit here having fun and
in a few seconds pull off a gram of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I do have the large unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the small one, five by five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a large one that is three times the
size.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 by 15 by 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in the other room and it's going to
be my next review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I'm going to be getting that
up before I go camping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I wanted to really push this one
through and make sure you guys saw how
[SPEAKER_03]: cool these units were.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the opportunity, get yourself
on the pre-order.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on Denial's page and you're
looking to buy anything else, you can use
[SPEAKER_03]: the code STAYMELTY, all one word.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll give you a nice little
discount on your order.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pre-orders of this unit are already so
cheap, there is no discount available
[SPEAKER_03]: through that code.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, please don't bother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, let's collect some more resin
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, each time I lift it up, it's cleaner
and cleaner and cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still some resin on there,
but we're definitely getting cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so let's collect this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it's already quite, quite hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff I find, but in particular,
that is very dry or has been quite long
[SPEAKER_03]: cured, I find that the rosin from that
even on a low heat and a low press,
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes out like dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, literally, you go to collect it and
I find it a little bit easier to heat up
[SPEAKER_03]: the tool a little bit to get it up there
because it's just like dust and you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: click on it and it just flicks and flies
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I think this is easily going to
be another point on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a point two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Decent amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely more than what I would take on
a dab, but I'm no matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountain man, I'm not sure if you guys
have seen that guy do his like 20 gram
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know what, all these guys
that are taking huge dabs, I'm super
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed that you can circular breathe,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, if you're going to impress me and
take a huge dab, I'd like to see all the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke go into your lungs in one shot and
then come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be something to work
for if I was personally in the big dab
[SPEAKER_03]: game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see what we added to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice strong parchment, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed it doesn't just rip,
but it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, without barely even touching this,
like barely touching it, I just get a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice, beautiful, well-done piece and I'm
going to guess that it is over a gram now.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.7 and this was 0.5, so it's 1.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what, just for shits and
giggles, let's give it another tiny press
[SPEAKER_03]: and see if we're able to squeeze anything
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will leave it even a little bit longer
this time, like over 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sizzled out a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't have a burnt popcorn taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: The color is still really beautiful,
amber, amber-esque.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say it's any darker than the
last two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just keep raising the limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to find that we had
more than two grams of hash in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see if it's only a
gram of husk left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to weigh that for you guys as
well and give you that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pressure on these things, because
you're going to ask and I'm going to write
[SPEAKER_03]: it in the comments, is between 1200 and
1600 pounds of pressure, depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: tight you set it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's four springs, one on each
corner of the plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they definitely each have a decent
amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally haven't found the need to go
much harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea that it's not super hard
to close and open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like the idea of catching
the thing in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then otherwise, yeah, it's just been a
really great unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Temperature-wise, I think it goes up to
400 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried to raise it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I heard that the temperature range is
quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that of a t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think like 0 to 400 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't want to go over 200
plus Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really trying to keep it low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another nice little ball of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I did the other day, easily
enough, I just opened it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And closed it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulled a little up there, right at the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of the circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we give it a little spin,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you don't have to do what I'm doing
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If some of you are like, oh, he's exposing
it to more heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: By all means, if your shit is lacking
terpene so much, you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do what I just did with a very
low, low temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of just being lazy to do it
in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did, how I did these ones,
was once I turned the unit off and it went
[SPEAKER_03]: down, down, down, down, down in
temperature, and they were very much just
[SPEAKER_03]: warm, I then just put it on and gave it a
little bit more pressure and pressed them
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an option that you have to do as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep it in mind, if you do have
material that's already lacking in
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes or the water hash, wash most of
those terpenes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or for some reason, you're not really
rocking a ton of terpenes, then something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that could only diminish them more,
avoid doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we weigh this now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it's quite flat.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still some stickiness to it,
but it's not very dirty, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can get it open enough, without too
many seams, like little ripples in the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen, you can usually pull the hash off
in almost a single piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just grab these sort of side pieces
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find out what we got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a gram?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a gram and a half?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1.4, and I easily think we can get it
up to 1.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'd say we had about close to three
grams of hash, and we could get an almost
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% return.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, 1.3 and 1.2, it was about two
and a half grams, and we got about a 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: The raws and weighs, I would say,
let's see real quick, plus the .5,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is 1.9, minus the .5 is 1.4,
so 1.4 and 1.4.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going back and forth,
this one, between 1.3 and 1.4,
[SPEAKER_03]: but basically what we got there was a 50%
return.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a four-star bubble, and we turned
it into a seven-star raws, and if you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see that up close, because I know
you do, that's what we got right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's quite nice, sappy and pulley,
and I suspect as it hardens, it will
[SPEAKER_03]: become more of a shatter-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and that was what I called the
darker one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one that turned into this
when it dried, which is absolute shatter,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can kind of tell at this point that
the colors, oh yeah, they're pretty on
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might get a little darker yet here
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a dark water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this one had a more of a blondish
tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still is a dark water hash,
but it squeezes out a very golden color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kind of nice material, and let's
see what we're going to do here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to squeeze out one more batch
of the screen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can even weigh the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also weighs about .5, if I can get some
of this excess bubble off, tiny little
[SPEAKER_03]: bits that have squeezed themselves into
the, oh, we'll call it .6.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to weigh it this time,
and try to do like two grams, unless it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just way too little, and we'll bump it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's three right there,
so let's just do three grams, and see what
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of returns we can get on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is, like I said, three-star
bubble, mostly because the Canadian sun,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to diss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resin-wise, it's very hard to produce
really high-quality, dabble-able product
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lot of the parts of Canada,
because the sun just doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: power of the tropical sun, or the
Californian sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that's all kind of loose in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, the edges of these are now
sticky, which I find very convenient that
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just push them closed, and I'm going
to collect it in the same piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten it pretty clean already in the
past, so we're going to go for an
[SPEAKER_03]: eight-second one for the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, count it with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just here, giving her a couple more
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a nice little splotch come out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I usually like to put it in
the freezer, but I'm not going to run back
[SPEAKER_03]: and forth each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I will do is, I will dab,
another little bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's squeeze out another bud and see what
we can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to actually dab the sativa
bud that we hit, the haze, but let's try
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the other ones, which I believe was
chemo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the chemo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, these are big chunky nuggets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just use even a small one,
and that's more than enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do find that with the rosin,
once again soil grown with all the tips,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's good to break the buds up into
smaller pieces, and he finds that he gets
[SPEAKER_03]: better yields when he's broken a bud up
into a few smaller pieces than if he just
[SPEAKER_03]: uses one large piece of bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try it out, soil grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to press these three little
buds, one after the other, and I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to give it the pre-squeeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: One,
two, three.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we look at this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what you're going to see
when you open one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really can go any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, we've got some derbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the chemo was good, good producer,
as was the super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a super silver haze guy, a haze guy of
any kind, really, so I'm going to go for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and it's also quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will collect some first and then
photograph it with the macro lens so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean that off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Titanium clean, so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a bad idea to have the tool a little
bit warm, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's picking up beautifully, but I can
tell you if I didn't put this in with that
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of heat from the D-nail,
this would be shooting all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the super silver haze gift from
Horatio, much appreciated, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always know when Horatio passes
something my way, that it's gone through,
[SPEAKER_03]: he won't just give something that's not
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He seems to always give his best,
and it's one of the things you've got to
[SPEAKER_03]: love about the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone that gives their best, you have to
have an appreciation for.
[SPEAKER_03]: AKA Compassions, the Soil Grums,
and of course all the people many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many years before that that were probably
pressing hash in the old barns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeezing oil out of these giant tonnages
of hash, I'm sure that was considered
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a special treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze out of the sick,
mothership combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely has that very strong sativa
taste right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very spicy and exotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: More towards the sandalwoods and less
towards the sweets and the flavorful
[SPEAKER_03]: fruity ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our piece cooled here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to remember where we were for a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, did we press that or did we
not press that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to leave these other two little
chunks of nugs to go with the chemo here
[SPEAKER_03]: on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get back to collecting of this resin,
which has now been cooling for a bit here.
Whoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: All baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that's really quite nice right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bet you I could peel this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really start to learn the resin when
you start to get involved with it and play
[SPEAKER_03]: around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another thing about rosin that I
really appreciate that it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: educational for people to understand when
they say, oh, I put a bud in and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: get anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the wrong temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the wrong pressure?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times it's not going to be
the wrong pressure or the wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it's going to be is the wrong bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for people to be able to be told that
or see that for themselves without taking
[SPEAKER_03]: it as like an affront or an assault on
their own personal ego, but allowing them
[SPEAKER_03]: to swallow that and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just find better and knowing the
difference when you find the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite something with the buds to just
press a single bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes a bud will literally squeeze out
four to five times more resin than another
[SPEAKER_03]: bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that says a lot about the genetics and
the grower and what was used and all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those sort of variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a nice little clump we got
there out of our first batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collect that on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get rid of those little guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that back on the collection plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's 0.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guaranteed there's more to be had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will squeeze this out a couple more
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys have any questions about
the press, I urge you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know some things, but definitely hit
up D-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: D-nail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hit up Stevie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hit up Willie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hit up Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all great guys over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're definitely into customer
service and helping and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping the dialogue going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're good that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a little bit more squeezed out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like with myself, I get about 80%
in my first squeeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, that last 20% or even
sometimes less than 20%, the quality of it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks exactly the same as the first
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look any less quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be interesting to find out
about where in the resin head the oils and
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabinoids are existing and which
ones squeeze out first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they always squeeze out,
you know, the same quality each time
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's all the same oil in the sack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if the quality that goes out first is
better than the quality that comes out
[SPEAKER_03]: last or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are things that really interest me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we'll find answers to
these things in the future as more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more people play.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really could see licensed producers
and the bigger companies starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out that this is an amazing
alternative to hydrocarbon extraction,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly the butane hydrocarbon
extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: As myself, I don't have a problem with the
delimiting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a pretty solid way to
produce an incredible quality medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: without the worry of, of course,
burning or blowing yourself up very badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, rosin is definitely going to take hits
on butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to, it's hit hard and it's
great because it's, who wins in the end
[SPEAKER_03]: are the people that are no longer inhaling
non-quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are there going to be problems with
rosin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already talked about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: People using bad pressing screens,
people using too much heat, too much
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure, people passing chemical
molecules onto the actual oil through the
[SPEAKER_03]: transference of heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely something we're going to
have to pay attention to and not act like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always going to have a place in my
heart for full melt wet washes and full
[SPEAKER_03]: melt dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll always be like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just one more thing to fill
the quiver of solventless quiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we've got about a gram of oil
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we put in?
[SPEAKER_03]: We put three grams in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this one was the one that was 40,
that I brought up to 45% by squeezing like
[SPEAKER_03]: many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will squeeze until she's no longer
giving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that is rosin in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the D-Nail Rosin Press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the fact that they've got the two
digital controllers to control each plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep the temperatures accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a decent amount of pressure here
that you can produce more if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: By just simply turning that plate around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, the ease of use,
it's hard to deny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a lot easier than sitting
around with a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll probably laugh at myself one
day for how long I did the hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never even got a big hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the tiny little one that was absurd
and ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might just take that hair
straightener, put it into here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and press that hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get rid of it once and for all.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, collect the last little bits of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you guys got any
questions, throw them in the comments
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try my best to answer them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are a question that I need to
forward you on to D-Nail, don't take it
[SPEAKER_03]: personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to pass the buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that they'll answer the
question way better than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience with this so far is very
limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got my unit the other day,
as did Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check his Instagram at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, check us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squishing Buds, Squishing Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the first of many videos that
you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be making water hash in the
near future, as I have quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: material saved up in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dry sift, we're probably not going to
see, unfortunately, until the weather
[SPEAKER_03]: cools off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been very, very warm here for
the last, oh, day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh geez, I don't know, three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a warm one, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, get that up to 1.1 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got, what did we have,
three grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just above 33% right now,
about 36.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm guessing is, because I did it
the other day, if I just continue to put
[SPEAKER_03]: it in the press and press it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the nice thing about the large one,
which we'll talk about in the next video,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that you can really put a big amount,
with a big giant piece of pressing screen,
[SPEAKER_03]: just go to town and literally,
I'm going to go for maybe like a 30 gram,
[SPEAKER_03]: like an ounce of bubble press,
and see how that turns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear it sizzling.
[SPEAKER_03]: A mild sizzle will do, you don't need to
cook it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good idea when you hear a
little bit of that sizzle, because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know that it's traveling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is traveling out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just keeps, you know, like I said,
returning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, smaller amounts each time,
but this is definitely more than,
[SPEAKER_03]: like right there is a dab that I just
collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another dab right there,
collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe another one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one last one, all along the bottom
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So four or five dabs collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like I said, if you're, you know,
insane and just love to hit monster,
[SPEAKER_03]: monster dabs, then this is one dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or half a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it all depends on how you look
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of it in a medicinal aspect as
something that is going to give relief to
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people need more and some people
need less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, this will be the last press
that we do on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the ease of use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say enough about it, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressing buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressing different types of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surrounded in rosin and super happy about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get yours at D-nail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-order is 350 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to get more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably 400, 450, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're basically selling them for
less than you can get a t-shirt press for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've put more work into them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate what you guys are doing,
as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still squeezing out rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from this bubble, I think this last
one might be a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take us out with a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the Breeder Steve strings.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first, when you try to collect them
just at first, they'll be a little bit too
[SPEAKER_03]: liquefied and they just want to smear.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you give it just a few seconds in the
open area and quickly they start to harden
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get that more snappy feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I leave it even longer,
what'll happen is as I hit it with the
[SPEAKER_03]: tool, it'll literally flick the hash away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have all these links and different
things that we discussed in the comments
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't subscribed, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't liked the video,
well, if you don't like the video,
[SPEAKER_03]: then don't like the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you did like the video,
it doesn't hurt to give us a little thumbs
[SPEAKER_03]: up there and we appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you all for your continued
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble on.
