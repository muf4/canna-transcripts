[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been filming videos since early this
morning I hooked up with Remo the urban
[SPEAKER_00]: grower Went down to his place photograph
with my macro lens his incredible garden
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got all these dinofem seeds in there
right now as well as his own UBC chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, which I actually acquired today That
was a real bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Remo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you the urban grower Came home got
the LED lush light did that video?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugged it in downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing right now next to the HPS
super excited about that I want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys from lush once again lush
lighting if you want to check those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: out Don't make assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the new and improved LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give it a shot Everyone's got an
attitude and an opinion about these things
[SPEAKER_00]: but for me personally what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna Let the light do the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna grow glandular resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna isolate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have HPS and LED right next to
one another so I should have a HPS and an
[SPEAKER_00]: LED resin content I've got the same plants
from the same cutting same phenotype on
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides, which is East Coast sour
diesel sweet skunk and convalesce So it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then came upstairs to find out that I
got something really exciting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning So this is a product that a friend
of mine has been making for some time And
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a product that I have always
supported I think it's just a really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: product every time I post a picture of it
or even mention it people trip so I
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured it was time to share Cut that
trying to fit the scissors in it just
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't happening Look at this open here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know being a bubble man,
I don't I'm not a joint smoker Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: very nice Very nice packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if any of you guys have seen
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of packaging they use on
toxic waste you just seal it on either
[SPEAKER_00]: side and you go over it with a Iron,
I believe and it seals it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Right been 13 years since I smoked
joints I used to love joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of miss them and so when I bumped
into Matt in Toronto and he said oh here I
[SPEAKER_00]: have one of these from so-and-so and I
said, whoa Where's he been?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen him in years Well,
he was here apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to see him, but I do have his
number So I contacted him and I saw hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we get something going on for the
bubble man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we try some of your wonderful
products and He said absolutely and he
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a little package so Really nice
packaging that you've done there my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't mention your name because I don't
know that you want your name mentioned But
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, you know, these are one of
the most impressive little products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make In the cannabis industry in
my opinion and there we go So It looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like a bunch of straws what could that be
that bubble Man has well, let's check this
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these ones are dry sift These are a
hundred percent dry sift And you really
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to see these to believe it so he
puts them in straws Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to show you guys this this
is like this is what I'm talking about I
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably use a little dabber to push
it out Oh, there's one we use the quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: oh I see they just crack right open the
straws open up So that straws cut in half
[SPEAKER_00]: and just peels off the other one and then
you can do the same thing down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom See if you guys can see that There
we go
[SPEAKER_00]: So You see that that right there Is a
hundred percent hash no paper no glue just
[SPEAKER_00]: good old hashish so Here's something you
don't see every day bubble man smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint Now it's not your everyday joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit so He's managed to come up
with the real proper amount of Contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: versus glandular trichome heads and when I
say contaminant, it's probably capitate
[SPEAKER_00]: stalks and cystal with hairs more so than
actual plant matter You just get that lit
[SPEAKER_00]: up real nice And take a hit
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're puffing a pure hash joint
like this the one thing I would say to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful about Because it does have a fair
amount of air space in the center That you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put the joint in front of your
teeth when you're taking rips just because
[SPEAKER_00]: you could pull back potentially a little
Coal a little hash bomber a little you
[SPEAKER_00]: know red hot so you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another thing when you're smoking
these
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to fix them if you see the ash
leave it be There we go Leave it be don't
[SPEAKER_00]: try to fix the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to knock the ash off It fucks up
the cherry and it ruins the hash joint
[SPEAKER_00]: this joint will burn right through and in
fact this joint weighs a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice taste on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's apparently the Bubba Kush Been a
while since I smoked one of these pure
[SPEAKER_00]: hash joints fucking love it mmm Should
probably take a Facebook update picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow super nice, you can see that ash
holding it's holding strong there hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped off
[SPEAKER_00]: Real thick beautiful smoke on this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you can notice in the camera,
but it's a real blue smoke Always a good
[SPEAKER_00]: sign as a hash smoker when I see that blue
color in the smoke I'm much happier than
[SPEAKER_00]: if I see a gray color What is that
according to I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would suspect the ratio of terpenes and
cannabinoids versus plant matter waxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: lipids whatever It just seems to be a nice
good sign when you get that blue smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: About halfway through the hash joint here
God it's nice to just be hitting hit after
[SPEAKER_00]: hit after hit after hit and feel it
completely in the top of my head here I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean most people would put this joint down
right around now
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm not most people I've been
puffing pretty chronic for about 20 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years hash for 13 plus years chronically
every day I like the line in the hip-hop
[SPEAKER_00]: song hip-hop dash reggae where he says You
can say it's habitual But every day it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: ritual I like that
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I wish I would have brought these two
remotes today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a real nice to smoke a joint
with Remo those guys passed me joints a
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundred times today and a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke paper and I don't smoke glue
and that's just the bottom line It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: anything against the you know,
and I don't smoke herb as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really those three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty major Chris pretty major
full pop for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spoke ash so What better way to
sort out me Than to let me smoke a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: hash joint so you Can see there we got
that ash Looking okay nice and long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is right around the time where people
would try to fix the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fucking do it Leave the ash alone
[SPEAKER_00]: The ash might even involve Cooling the
cherry down a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know but it seems to If you break
the ash off what seems to happen is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom there where you see the black ring
It seems to let loose right there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to crumble and fall away if you
break off The ash so Don't do that
[SPEAKER_00]: Little piece of the hash gave a part there
in my boat But I mean what a nice trip
[SPEAKER_00]: treat that is right That is just a
beautiful thing right there pure hash
[SPEAKER_00]: joint a gram of love in life Now this is
dry sift he does make bubble hash ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these ones might be bubble hash
Yeah Yeah, these are the bubble hash ones
[SPEAKER_00]: right here So these ones are 70% chocolate
chunk and 30% AK 47 bubble hash and then
[SPEAKER_00]: these other ones the bubble Kush are 100%
dry set so And he's done a nice job on
[SPEAKER_00]: this and then he sent me some of his new
ones which are 50% of it is hemp star bud
[SPEAKER_00]: ground into powder and then remixed Into
50% dry set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably gonna share those with Remo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I have no interest in smoking
herb
[SPEAKER_00]: But my good friend Rebo loves it and I
love that we have such different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives such different full
appreciation for the plant But coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: a different perspective Remo loves the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves the the joints He loves looking
at buds and thinking and I'm gonna roll
[SPEAKER_00]: that up and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the resin I still love the buds and
I love photographing them and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at them and smelling them but I'm
really most inspired when I'm extracting
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolating the resin heads off of the
bud That's that's where I get my kicks
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the mothership bowl that I guess
could be Kind of like as an ashtray That's
[SPEAKER_00]: how we do That's the entire ash of this
joint is still on here even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter than it was It's sort of shrunk in
it's there hasn't been any ash drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and the ash is quite a nice grayish
white color It's certainly not overly
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, now we're getting down to it real
real nice this is the last little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: this joint and this is really where you
make the decision if you're going to Smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: this nice and clean and finish it right to
the end or if someone's gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: impatient Knock off the ash and the cherry
and fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go for the First one which is
puff it right down to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash bomber and that's awesome like that
bad boy out now Puffing down clean This is
[SPEAKER_00]: the only joints that I need to smoke these
days, you know pure unadulterated hash
[SPEAKER_00]: joints Free people that asked me on the
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do with my non melty bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should roll that shit into hash
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do this bubble man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is my friend's method I have no
idea exactly what he's doing But I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what I would try to do this very
same thing I would laminate out squares of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash in grams and I would get them to a
certain thickness into a certain size I
[SPEAKER_00]: would roll them up just like he's doing I
suspect he puts a toothpick or something
[SPEAKER_00]: on the inside Freezes them in the fridge
of the freezer cools them and then removes
[SPEAKER_00]: the toothpick From the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I suspect he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a huge secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think other people have done it I've
seen them sold as pixie sticks down in
[SPEAKER_00]: California 10 plus years ago And I think
they've been for sale for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plus years here in British Columbia,
so Really cool little thing though,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you that's one happy bubble
man puffing on that fucking Kootenay Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush Well, I didn't count how many rips I
got but there's any really gung-hoers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that want to go back in the video
and Count how many rips I got I gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: think I got 50 did I get 50?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh That is just about ready to fall
Beautiful so we peeled it off nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ash and there's the the roach
That was a one ash hash joint right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah So I mean a little roach like
this, you know If it was just paper and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of herb even if you had your
supercharged thing going on in there It
[SPEAKER_00]: would certainly not be The equivalent of
what's here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still three big Dabs or at least
one really big dab I'm gonna smoke down
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I wanted to show you the
absolute perfection that my friend has
[SPEAKER_00]: developed with this particular method I
Don't know how he does it so perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it burns to near perfection every time
I've ever smoked one of these It's only
[SPEAKER_00]: when someone messes with it that it falls
apart And
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why when you're smoking a
roach But it makes it more efficient by
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of squinting one eye I'm not
even sure I could hit this without
[SPEAKER_00]: squinting that eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys ever notice that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that got hot on my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close Dropped her there she
is everyone the end of the joint tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little cherry I didn't even actually burn
the I'll get it right in here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you have it smoked down to
darn near nothing Of course, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: always throw this in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have one right here Careful
Pedro lamp I Mean, I guess we might as
[SPEAKER_00]: well finish it right finish what we
started type of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Just got too too darn small for its
own good looks Okay Time to finish her off
[SPEAKER_00]: a Little bit harsh in a bum rep little
bit, but that's again because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked a whole gram of it
[SPEAKER_00]: Who that one was tasty That was a tasty
rip That's
[SPEAKER_00]: her that's her need to be smoking the last
of the ash Beautiful Well, there you have
[SPEAKER_00]: it stay stay tuned for a potential address
website Where you too yourself can order
[SPEAKER_00]: up some of these pure hash joints?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you it's not gonna be the last
time you see them for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super enjoyable Just puffed a
gram of dry sift in about five minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching bubble man's world see
you later You You You
