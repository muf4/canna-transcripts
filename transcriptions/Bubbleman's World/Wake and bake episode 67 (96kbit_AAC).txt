is the weekend Wow, we got one more week
[SPEAKER_02]: and bake for the week and then we got hash
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for hash church We've had the
couple of good ones in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks and we're just gonna kind of try and
keep it going as much as we can My
[SPEAKER_02]: drop-down was made by Corey Cottenham and
you can check him out at Corey glass korey
[SPEAKER_02]: Underscore glas s on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that's His Instagram,
but I'm sure if you punch in Corey glass
[SPEAKER_02]: or Corey Cottenham it will pop up Yeah,
what's the oldest hash you still have
[SPEAKER_02]: probably my ten year ten years pretty old
pretty old batch No, not not as of yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't sell the this is actually more
than a poster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually quite like a Almost like a
thick advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what they would call it,
but we could definitely sell it It
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't be cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean just to have that printed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is a hundred bucks So but it's not
poster material, it's you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: material That's weatherproof and you can
put it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some type of a nylon or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Banner I think we should hit one
more bowl before I have to bugger off
[SPEAKER_02]: because I can promise you today's got to
be a short one Focused on the children of
[SPEAKER_02]: course and for those of you that wonder
and think that here I am just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned what I'm actually doing is I'm
medicating for the morning I'm getting my
[SPEAKER_02]: medication on it's gonna help me with my
focus it's gonna help me with minor pains
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have in my body and It's gonna help
feed my endocannabinoid system in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: that will allow my cells to communicate
with one another and keep my body happy
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy and my two main systems the immune
system in the central nervous system in
[SPEAKER_02]: homeostasis and the importance of this is
Should never be underestimated Keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: these systems in homeostasis is extremely
important and when you have someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: an alcoholic pill-popping Maniac telling
you that you're the drug user burning your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain cells while they're actually
damaging their brain physically with
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and other substances You got to
wonder what kind of a topsy-turvy world
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been born into That the whole world
has flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Shelly Lynn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stay iry and you as well Hey right
on drew well, no, it's not about a
[SPEAKER_02]: judgment it's about a conversation and a
dialogue that we open because it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: important that people don't catch a Whip
glimpse of this video and think oh my god
[SPEAKER_02]: that man is he's getting high on drugs
while he's no what he's Doing is he's
[SPEAKER_02]: medicating on a little bit of cannabis and
it's very different than getting high on
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs And we've got a long way to go still
on places on the whisk West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much accepted Cannabis use but
let's be honest in a lot of other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still isn't if you're following Shona
Banda story She's in court right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's in, Missouri Having a hard
time so anything you can go do to support
[SPEAKER_02]: her if you want to Google Shona Banda
fundraiser She is raising money for her
[SPEAKER_02]: court and we're gonna try and have her on
hash church again Maybe raise some more
[SPEAKER_02]: money for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did send the other 350 US dollars that
we raised through hash church It was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a couple hundred, but I threw 150
in there myself plus the 300 from prior so
[SPEAKER_02]: that was six hundred and fifty dollars
that hash church donated to forest herd
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Caladrius network and it made me
feel good It wasn't a huge amount,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a lot, you know in a sense that
you guys really pushed that boundary We'd
[SPEAKER_02]: never raised money like that before so I
want to thank each and every one of you
[SPEAKER_02]: for that And I hope that we can do a
little bit for Shona as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's have one more bake before we Get
on with our days here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh That's taste good Probably get five
more rips like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey right on Mike's atomic skier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great day and thank you for all the
positive words
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got a couple hundred People in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Chad is gonna move when you get a
couple hundred people that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: all engaged in the conversation Pretty
good Thanks, Johnny will do gonna have an
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome time gonna go down to the
trampoline right away and Then just spend
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole day focused on the little guy
and all the things that he loves and needs
[SPEAKER_00]: and wants Whoo D now just keeps delivering
[SPEAKER_02]: Well drying tips, you know, it's not going
to dry properly if You have it in large
[SPEAKER_02]: chunks the smaller the pieces the powder
the dust the better this will get you dry
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a environment that is very
humid Like the West Coast and you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: high amount of precipitation a Desiccant
is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the pizza boxes They close they keep
dust and debris and hairs from falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep people from knocking shit over I
can stack them on top of one another and
[SPEAKER_02]: the cardboard acts as a desiccant and
pulls moisture out with the help of
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity from the hash it really is one of
the best ways to go about doing it and
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't get pizza boxes with weird
coatings I just go to the like healthiest
[SPEAKER_02]: pizza box pizza store I can go to the
place that sells the whole wheat the
[SPEAKER_02]: gluten-free the blah blah blah vegan
broccoli pizza if you have a pizza Place
[SPEAKER_02]: like that go there and get your boxes not
to fucking Domino's or to fucking Pizza
[SPEAKER_02]: Hut or any of these other swag Dumps,
you know go to a good pizzeria somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: that you actually enjoy eating at and
you'll find that you probably will get a
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty decent box.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the last fish show that I
attended?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's crazy that I don't even
really know it I don't know if it was nine
[SPEAKER_02]: nine ninety nine in Vancouver or if I
ended up going to some shows and 2000 I
[SPEAKER_02]: must have done some 2000 shows but I
really Really don't remember Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: the good fiber exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not the quality of the fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that you don't want Any
chemicals to have been sprayed in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's always the problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always chemicals Good to hear
Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you're growing the goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Thought for years that you just had
stacks of Domino's pizza boxes.

desk You have a good one.

we're not in fact quite opposite We're
[SPEAKER_02]: here to help People who have ailments and
people who are sick and people that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know they have an endocannabinoid system
Just from us getting into herb and
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoying it and smoking weed and listening
to records and feeling that vibe That's
[SPEAKER_02]: what brought us to wanting to help people
We didn't go and take degrees at school
[SPEAKER_02]: and learn to become doctors or any of that
we just You know, I'll take the word from
[SPEAKER_02]: Dank runner We just stewarded this plant
we've stewarded this plant to where it is
[SPEAKER_02]: and Everyone should be proud of that for
sure because you fought against the the
[SPEAKER_02]: the mainstream society and what they said
