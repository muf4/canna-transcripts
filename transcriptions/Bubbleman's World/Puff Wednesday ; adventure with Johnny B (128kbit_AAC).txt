all these puff Wednesdays?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look back at some of the more things
that we said on the show like a decade
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they all came true Dude,
I'm telling you we had some fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some fun What I my favorite puff
Wednesday was when we went to the airport
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shipped your plants like across
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was unbelievable That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a torch up or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I know if the best thing was
both that what they say don't tell anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, they said don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does Johnny B do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He films the entire thing with me puts it
out onto the channel to a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: people that video I feel like it got a few
views I feel like that one's in the 30 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 K range, but we're just gonna mellow
today Puff a few bowls in a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get to see John very often
Although we did get to have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: private time in Edmonton I went to his
hotel room and we chilled out for a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit got into the shit and the life and
everything that's going on and Exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: times Johnny B exciting Your chest banger
is like on fire right now,
you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally Killing my soul while I sit next
to him, although this banger was already
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed had that been like a JP Toro
banger I'd be on the floor right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple just crying couple
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm good You're smoking hard,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that say?
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature do you hit that at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you melted your time turptimer yet a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little bit of a weird edge
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ring light is absolutely insane it's
like this big it's so bright Where'd you
[SPEAKER_01]: get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark the place Interesting I Tried to
change that to the guy for some doubts and
[SPEAKER_02]: some containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't know what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wanted cash He's actually here
trust you're really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He paid 194 brand-new It was still
brand-new never used it used it once it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all to me for ad-lux I still give him a
container That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like you might you could use this for
branding your girl If you want to go
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing, there's a hundred I say there's
42 uses to a bad tanner Wow It's true like
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grind everything with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a grinder tight So think of the
Jetsons in the future your container
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three different sizes it comes
shooting up to the like thousand for in
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the sky You open it up and put
you might take me put your food and grind
[SPEAKER_02]: up and it goes back in system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like Jetsons right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in full support of all things Johnny B
whatever it is you're doing I Broke my
[SPEAKER_01]: collarbone about five weeks ago,
but maybe I'll try push-ups today at one
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time I'll try you know,
I haven't done a push-up in six weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: because the globicles pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells potent that smells potent Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen, I always have the little
extras, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then this container will probably last
me a couple of years at least that looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like it would Yeah, I know everything
lasts me years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you drove your truck off a highway
or something or you know got t-boned and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks ago
[SPEAKER_01]: The boat dropped off safely and we do need
to get some duct tape because my cover is
[SPEAKER_01]: terribly ripped I'm just gonna duct tape
Jerry together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty awesome No,
I had a friend come over yesterday and I
[SPEAKER_02]: helped her with her trailer stuff like
that and she left to pretty sure
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, first of all, let's talk about the
elephant in the room I ate shit about 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes ago coming out of Johnny's house
Tell the story tell the story What would
[SPEAKER_02]: happen is we're talking about this
mulberry tree that had an ice storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's with the whole top It was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took up your whole yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like take a look at this wet wood
piece I went down on my broken collarbone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you went down on the house when
we did the 80% 20% 80% on my on my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I fell over onto my broken collarbone
that I broke Four and a half five weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're here taking the boat and
putting it in storage for the winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also kind of like a puff
Wednesday adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here comes the gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be all right Well, we just got the
boat off the trailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna drive on out of here We're
gonna go to the samosa place a little
[SPEAKER_01]: session in the parking lot Maybe after we
eat grab a samosa or two or enough before
[SPEAKER_01]: and after all right So we just wanted to
share some of the beautiful scenario with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a cool little dog Who's just
kind of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's just joined us?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even know who he is He's your pal
dude, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like he's your dog Anyway,
always nice to say goodbye to the boat at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Johnny B for helping me and You
know, we'll tell the story of me falling
[SPEAKER_02]: later You did great you did great All
right, well, we'll see you guys here soon
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna go eat all right All right
guys, so this is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: voiceover considering I'm an idiot I must
have accidentally clicked on the mute
[SPEAKER_01]: button of this new phone So this is our
samosa journey that John and I stopped in
[SPEAKER_01]: at Chilliwack These are some of the best
samosas I've ever had including my samosas
[SPEAKER_01]: in India and there's another video after
this that's five minutes long So I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'll do is I will record the
voiceover for that now as well So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is I didn't want to cut it out
because it makes up a chunk of the puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday video I can't exactly remember
what we were talking about other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that we were Driving around the area
and it was a beautiful sunny day And it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just kind of good vibes puff Wednesday
always fun hanging out with John look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that smile He's legitimately like the
happiest guy that I've ever met and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just cruising around those trees
look like they're ripping by pretty darn
[SPEAKER_01]: fast We've had our samosas and we're on
our way to John's house now actually to To
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple of puffs and then to end
puff Wednesday for the for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Am a little bit sore here having had
fallen at John's house on my broken arm my
[SPEAKER_01]: left arm The clavicle was broken about
four and a half to five weeks ago So it
[SPEAKER_01]: was healing up nicely and then I collapsed
and slipped on John's the log that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Frames his cobblestone between his grass
and cobblestone walkway I stepped right on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice round little log and down I
went honestly I wish I had a video of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was well, it was probably
pretty funny to see although I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: John's Face was not looking funny at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the beautiful Langley
Abbotsford Mountains there should have
[SPEAKER_01]: probably filmed more of that because it is
pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Wish I knew what John was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that it wasn't The audio wasn't
gone, but yeah, there's a new button on
[SPEAKER_01]: this new phone And if you hold it down for
a couple seconds It mutes your phone and
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually turns your your audio off when
you're recording as well Which I just
[SPEAKER_01]: learned so yeah shout out to iPhone
creating the madness for me But I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to share this because it's just it's still
a great video of you know John's smile in
[SPEAKER_01]: a way and and just Going into deep
explanations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wish I knew what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably all like the most positive
shit probably talking a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: his AI tools that he's been building and
Maybe even a little bit of Puffing so I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess we're getting closer and closer to
his house We were about 20 minutes away
[SPEAKER_01]: where we dropped my boat off for the for
the winter to where he lives so he's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Abbotsford and the boat drop-off is in
Chilliwack, but just was just a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: day to Cruise the the countryside if you
will you know we're driving by crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're driving by Mountains here Johnny B
is gonna give us a little little shot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the grapes and now the corn Got some
beautiful mountains pretty much right over
[SPEAKER_01]: those mountains is the US so we're not too
far from America Which funny enough later
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the day I would end up at the Blaine
Washington border of Canada and America
[SPEAKER_01]: and Yeah, I had a few responsibilities to
do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He oh, I know what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking about how the yellow barn is
no longer in business up here and that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been replaced by a It's just kind of
a couple of older guys talking about where
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when things were different when
oh that used to be there and this used to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen like that And yes life is changing
as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate the changes of life and We
welcome them with open arms That being
[SPEAKER_01]: said it was nice to get back to something
familiar which was Just getting together
[SPEAKER_01]: with Johnny B and yeah filming filming a
little bit of puff Wednesday for you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are gonna try and film some more puff
Wednesdays here in the upcoming weeks It's
[SPEAKER_01]: not an easy show to film.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really last-minute with no plan
It was more like inviting John along to my
[SPEAKER_01]: adventure of returning the boat But I'm
gonna plan a couple of good puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesdays at least this winter It'd be
good for us to go out on a little
[SPEAKER_01]: adventure and and film everything and we
just have such a good time there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow barn and there's the Triple O's
Chevron that has sort of replaced it back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day if you knew the entrance to
Chilliwack and Yarrow Road you would know
[SPEAKER_01]: that this area that yellow barn was like a
big thing and it was a big deal and when
[SPEAKER_01]: John was a kid he probably went there and
got fruits and veggies and Now it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, anyway, it's great Great to do
this little voiceover and we'll talk soon
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're back I'm fucking crippled
again, but not really John says I'm fine
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't fall on your broken arm
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually quite happy to have these
shades on they look pretty tricky when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get both circles You can see the circles
in the eyes, yeah, I know I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: filming I see circles in my eyes You
