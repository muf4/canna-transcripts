[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back guys Johnny B and me in the
house and we're about to fresh-frozen
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm so excited that you came by with
the fresh frozen watermelon today Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, that's a birthday treat for real What
kind of friend brings this crop over now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I'm not keeping the resin but
just to be able to make it and smoke It
[SPEAKER_04]: with John to me is a perfect most
beautiful of birthday gifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've actually got a rarity here that
you haven't seen yet I've got all three of
[SPEAKER_04]: the bubble bag kits that we're selling
right now from the original the top-grade
[SPEAKER_04]: Warranty for life durable as a mofo set
that I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the professional has makers kit
That's the most expensive five gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: eight bag kit that comes in at three
hundred and twenty plus dollars Number two
[SPEAKER_04]: which still has all the colors Right Just
a slightly lower GSM thread count.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bags are still quality, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use an outside bag to change the
color to show people that this is not an
[SPEAKER_04]: original kit So that they shouldn't be
paying the original price.
[SPEAKER_04]: This bag is about $50 cheaper this kit I
basically pass the savings on of the
[SPEAKER_04]: slightly cheaper Material for the bags and
the cheaper out outer material and
[SPEAKER_04]: basically pass that right on to the
customer So that bag comes in at about
[SPEAKER_04]: 270.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice or US sorry and then the final ones
which unfortunately these look a little
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller than those other two kits because
I only had a one gallon kit and these were
[SPEAKER_04]: fives but pretend this is a five gallon
kit now these are the lights and these are
[SPEAKER_04]: the ones where I really Went out hard on
the savings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I changed everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no eight colors I took away the
eight colors and put only three colors,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a pretty massive savings for me
being able to not have to buy eight rolls
[SPEAKER_04]: of full color, which is a You know,
it's everything everything adds up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very expensive to buy eight separate
roll So I was able to pass on a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: savings on the eight bag five gallon kit
of the lights at just a hundred and fifty
[SPEAKER_04]: bucks That's like half price.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less than half price for the original
So, you know what just lots of people
[SPEAKER_04]: always asking for deals and always asking
for cheaper sets So I like to accommodate
[SPEAKER_04]: we give deals and we have three different
sets that can accommodate you for whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: your price Prices not to sound too much
like an infomercial because I like the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that John and I's videos are More
chill and more real but I I never talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about the bags that much and this is a
good time to do it and We use the lights
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of our other videos exactly and
we've used the originals I did the
[SPEAKER_04]: originals with Remo I believe and It's
just a matter of one day running but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what bags are you using?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well for my birthday, I'm using the
top-of-the-line 100% full lifetime
[SPEAKER_04]: warranty bubble bag originals,
of course, you know and man That's soft
[SPEAKER_04]: like you can travel with this bad boy as a
hash maker across the fucking plains of
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan Sleeping in the mountains,
you know, I open I think we might actually
[SPEAKER_04]: try and do that I think we will do that
after Jamaica, which we're gonna do in a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of weeks We're gonna be in Jamaica
in a couple weeks with Tony potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: jibs Scott from rare dankness and a few
other people I've invited down for kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: just a real cool Hey, let's get together
and have an amazing time in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go hang out with some cool artists in
Kingston Go to a couple of cool parties
[SPEAKER_04]: meet the Rasta It's going to the hills
make hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's just sweet All right,
so Johnny John has brought over the
[SPEAKER_04]: watermelon today We've got the I won't
pull it out just yet because we should
[SPEAKER_04]: fill I guess when we fill this we will
need the herb There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna use the bubble now for our
mixing and we're gonna use the barrel
[SPEAKER_04]: shaped bags I know a lot of people love
their triangle shaped bags, which I will
[SPEAKER_04]: be bringing to market soon spoke with a
few different people recently Nicka T
[SPEAKER_04]: being one of them offered him Pyramid
shaped bags because we can of course
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacture any style of bag that people
request if there's any professional hash
[SPEAKER_04]: makers out there that want their own
Specialty kind of bag, you know get in
[SPEAKER_04]: touch with us We'll make you anything you
want and one thing, you know about bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: bags and fresh Eddie's is that we make
quality products.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Cool
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good offer anyway, so we're gonna
do the fresh frozen How much did you bring
[SPEAKER_04]: weight out of 400 grams of wet for 400
grams?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the watermelon that you showed me
at the front door Oh God, dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it smells down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just go up to the camera and show
them this glistening nugget of perfection
[SPEAKER_04]: frozen solid It's pretty frozen,
dude Look at that that resin was so sticky
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do a video of it All right,
that was very cold extremely cold so what
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll do is we will lay down a layer of
ice Bottom layer of ice
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my birthday treat Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it feels like little icy trichome
rocks Yeah, now we're gonna put Just show
[SPEAKER_04]: them make a nice little layer of ice and
then a layer of herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you can put more ice in Excellent
you basically want to make it so the ice
[SPEAKER_04]: is covering that layer of herb pretty much
completely Just barely touch this herb
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just I just put that back in the ice
right there I've done this before with me
[SPEAKER_02]: and without with and without With the 400
grams it packs this bank perfectly I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: getting used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my little rubber made bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once that's full of fresh I know I'm
ready good to go and it's the 2.5 gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: 9.5 liter bin that I'm using Perfect good
sign John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how it all came off nice and clean
Perfect there you go, sir
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're gonna use ice in the bubble
now machine as well Nice just because our
[SPEAKER_04]: water is not necessarily gonna be the
coldest coldest coldest You could start
[SPEAKER_04]: turning that water on now actually and
we'll let that water run because it is an
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor hose in a black hose sitting out
In the Sun when it first comes out it can
[SPEAKER_04]: be pretty warm We're pretty blessed with
our water Look at that just fits so
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect unreal It's gonna be nice Can't
even tell you how good that TGA strain
[SPEAKER_04]: smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it watermelon all the time It is
the astro boy from TGA and it is a really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, bud So we're using the
bubble bag originals I will get rid of the
[SPEAKER_04]: lights and the standards and There's one
more little but I found would you like to
[SPEAKER_04]: put some ice in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll keep that for photography reasons
later nice It's on the ground now stuck to
[SPEAKER_04]: my finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want away?
[SPEAKER_04]: We will but what we're gonna have to do
first Let's get a little of this melted
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's such a perfect amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically filled this that's the cool
thing about the The barrel shaped bag is
[SPEAKER_04]: that it fills the machine perfectly and
just the last It allows you to mix as
[SPEAKER_04]: though the machine the bag isn't even
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I love about this bag That's
why I'm so surprised when I hear people
[SPEAKER_04]: say that They prefer the triangle bag and
that they're getting a bigger yield and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're getting I get my yield I get what
is there I never get less.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's 10% That's what I'm gonna get
and having a barrel shaped bag certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't going to be Isn't going to make it
that I get any less So let's get some
[SPEAKER_04]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll bring over the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring the hose over here I'm just
gonna pass in front of the camera here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll just reach if we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just have Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had the pressure turned down
there so we could do this We got lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: there I got it Awesome You know,
I know this is good come you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: want you to do come around and dab me out
a bowl With the D now that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's great about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can reach in here with a nice little
ball Yeah, dude, it's awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbing and filling up the bucket full of
ice here getting the bubble now going just
[SPEAKER_05]: very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did we dab up there number two and
three?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a very nice flavor I like it a lot
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is filling up beautifully.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Just hear it now almost getting up to
the top, which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Not even close It's actually about
halfway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and luckily It's got quite a bit of
distance about an inch and a half all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way around the whole thing that can fill
with water Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, you don't want to take
away all your water.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water is definitely a very important
component of making water hash Water and
[SPEAKER_04]: ice always what you say keep it cold Keep
it and I'll have you all know that this
[SPEAKER_04]: hose nozzle was cleaned by myself before I
stuck it in here I made sure to get all
[SPEAKER_04]: the particulates Or any little pieces that
were on it off and I cleaned it up real
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting a lot of Sort of flack
lately because I show people how to make
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble and of course I like to show them
how to make it properly But I also like to
[SPEAKER_04]: show people how to do it easily with
whatever they have available For where
[SPEAKER_04]: they are not everyone can afford an
expensive hash lab with machines and ice
[SPEAKER_04]: makers and RO's and so for those people
it's nice to be able to show them a way to
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to hand mix and You know how to
get your hash dry properly and all those
[SPEAKER_04]: things All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're getting close to the top Okay,
I'm gonna turn that off Yeah, so I'm about
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe two inches from the top and the
reason I'm leaving that distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice, too Now the bag will go
sideways and upside down So I got a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: and upside down all tied up We're gonna do
about a 10-minute mix today and then we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna come back and we're gonna pull some
bags for you nice and quickly The bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: now has been filled with water ice and
herb John told us we put 400 grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh frozen in there Which is probably
around a hundred grams So if we can pull
[SPEAKER_04]: out anywhere from 10 to 12 grams of hash
in return, we've done exceptional So let's
[SPEAKER_04]: get our mix in It's my birthday batch it's
your birthday So we're gonna continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke hash while this bad boy continues to
make Yeah, hit yourself with some haas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all righty then Stoked kind of like
making hash on your birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your birthday And always hitting it
nice I know someone was saying We take big
[SPEAKER_02]: bong ribs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think no, I think it's the quality of
house that we're smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bigger than normal, but it is your
birthday How can you not do a big birthday
[SPEAKER_02]: rip It was delicious that was hot That's
nice, too We'll catch you guys in a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: More water and the more ice more ice
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna get a great extraction ratio
John's got the parchment paper here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got pizza boxes four of them spread
out Which will be more than enough for 10
[SPEAKER_04]: to 12 grams It's always great to use less
hash for large area the more surface area
[SPEAKER_04]: the better and we've got the parchment
paper Unbleached for putting over top of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get so much flack for people Harshing on
me for cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I show you the cardboard because it's
available to most people Of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can have parchment paper and you've
gone to your store and got some that's
[SPEAKER_04]: great Just make sure in high humid areas
that it's not stopping the Wicking I do
[SPEAKER_04]: worry about the wax paper esque-ness of
the material but here we got John he's
[SPEAKER_04]: just gonna fold up the edges and we're
folding up the edges on the Parchment
[SPEAKER_04]: paper to just make like a little Protected
area so the bubble doesn't you know fall
[SPEAKER_04]: or get knocked off the parchment and we're
gonna continue we're gonna tape the
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment as well onto cardboard Thank
you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very welcome always nice to give a
friend a hand especially when I It's a you
[SPEAKER_04]: know about birthday hash batches There you
[SPEAKER_03]: go All right, so that's pretty cool Yeah,
that's it Stays up nice nice little box.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect for Keeping the bubble hash
safe All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's go see if if it's time for us
to Pull the bags
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks yellow and smell it It's almost like
a beige yellow I'm totally excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how cool that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can feel it when I open it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice We get these bad boys working
real soon Sounds good,
brother All right,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're back and our bubble now has just
stopped mixing we did about a ten minute
[SPEAKER_04]: or yeah about ten minutes and Water is
pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like Yeah, that is funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to describe it It's
got this light light green, but the green
[SPEAKER_04]: is like a good it's golden I won't say
smell my fingers, but it's So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: feel free to have a sip I always like to
taste my rhythm No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it floating right on top in
that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So We are gonna put the bags in the bucket
real quick this doesn't have to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time and I'll just go through the
colors and the Micron sizes we start with
[SPEAKER_04]: the purple the 25 micron It's the smallest
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure our bag is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bucket is nice and clean because I do
remember we got a little A few nuggets
[SPEAKER_04]: that fell in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, the only thing that's ever gone
in this bucket Is hash So not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so 25 micron going into a clean
bubble bubble bucket And we don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: have to turn it over but you can it's
definitely not as necessary Takes a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: longer if you want to do all the bags,
but it does help keep the screen nice open
[SPEAKER_04]: 45 micron the white This is our second bag
and it's definitely a bag that produces No
[SPEAKER_04]: shortage of resin that comes out of the 45
micron bag really regardless of the strain
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I've been popping lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that this box a 45 mile little
point Nice 73 micron that means he's out
[SPEAKER_04]: of 90 73 and 120 but it still goes to show
you that it's worth puffing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually throwing a little bit of
Watermelon on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was 73 yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I mentioned that I Might
have I might not have we've been dabbing
[SPEAKER_04]: bowls So there's 73 Yellow used to be the
gold bag until the black bag came along
[SPEAKER_04]: and stole its thunder Yes, the black bag
is my favorite bag and it is the 90 micron
[SPEAKER_04]: Today on this day of 90 micron I wear all
black in honor of my friend Javier from
[SPEAKER_04]: medical seeds rocking the medical seeds
shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are awesome Oh great time with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just good dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait till they come here and we
can show them You know our style We got
[SPEAKER_04]: the beeping and banging and beeping and
banging so number 120 micron orange So
[SPEAKER_04]: that 90 was a pretty Pretty good add-in
from the 120 to the 73 Everything between
[SPEAKER_04]: the 120 and the 73 is delicious and
awesome and we loved it But there were
[SPEAKER_04]: still thoughts that if we separated it it
might even be more different And of course
[SPEAKER_04]: it was very glad to have my 90 and 70
separated red 160 micron This is the
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminant bag but can also be a quality
bag, you know, there has been resin that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out of this bag that is melty I'm
puffing on some also 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Right now really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my little pony No, no, no,
I'm also Green sorry to interrupt go
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm just saying how tasty that 160 is
because I have some good actually resin
[SPEAKER_02]: and You know what it was there and I'm
like Wow, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can always try your 160 and your 45
You have to be quite pleased if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: good organic grower, you'd be amazed what
you can get You'll definitely know when
[SPEAKER_04]: it's when it's special you'll see right
away So this is the 220 now and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: still gonna use it even though that the
bag in here the bubble now barrel shaped
[SPEAKER_04]: bag is a 220 I still like to use my 220
bag and Just in case filter out any other
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminants that are of large particulate
Separate out from those smaller screens
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashing this Looks like this bags been
mixed once before Always good to keep your
[SPEAKER_04]: bags clean It's good to check the bottoms
of your screen sometimes before you shove
[SPEAKER_04]: them into a bucket It's a good idea you
can have debris and dirt on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_04]: your screen and now there's some dirt
that's right into your good hash and now
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't know how it got there,
but it was sitting on the bottom of the 73
[SPEAKER_04]: or the bottom of the 120 and you pushed it
down and when the water and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: went through that little Particulate fell
right into your hash and it's just one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing to pay attention to So we've got all
these now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do the draining quick
little drain All right, and we'll just do
[SPEAKER_04]: the rain on this boom That's exciting
Yeah, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this part making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom you know what it's it's the most
exciting part about this because when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing that run on there you're
like I Know about ready to get well,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we know what we're about to get so
because this is fresh frozen watermelon
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a fairly warm day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God the Sun went a little bit behind
the tree there We are in for some quick
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling of bags because when we pull in
fact what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest John is the 190 and the
160 no problem, but when we get to the 120
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should I think I need to dab
you up wick right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll dab dab me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be ready to dab There you go
[SPEAKER_04]: That there pass me your Tupperware
container Always need to keep for a second
[SPEAKER_04]: When using fresh frozen of such quality
nugget You got to do a second run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just touched it my fingers are sticky
well that water was coming out nice and
[SPEAKER_04]: clear Adding that extra gallon or two was
worked out in our favor
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent All right, so We've got our
little area set up here with our bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using a small bucket to flip the bags
over and then we've got a spray bucket
[SPEAKER_04]: over here that we're going to be able to
Utilize it's been in the ice for the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: time, so it's excellent Even right off the
bat There's spring to be done on this bag
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great so happy can't wait to see
the And you can do some spraying if you
[SPEAKER_04]: like Yeah So this is mostly pistol it
hairs stigmas big large contaminant if it
[SPEAKER_04]: was bubble it'd be moving a lot faster So
this this part will be a little bit slow
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're spraying John's got it about
halfway cleaned now I'll grab it from you
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely I'm sticking really
as you can see right now He can you can
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's it's just sticking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very very sticky All right,
so let's just give it a quick Little scoop
[SPEAKER_04]: what we can find we've got the screen nice
and wet Just give that a little scoop and
[SPEAKER_04]: drop that right there for 220 micron flip
this
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice to have that hose you're
off-camera, but what John's doing is he's
[SPEAKER_04]: leaning over the Deck right now,
and he's just cleaning the bag with the
[SPEAKER_04]: hose here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a little a little visual
Clean in the bags with a beautiful ocean
[SPEAKER_04]: view in the background Good Johnny No,
this is nice This is darn nice All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well let's get back to pulling our bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: We definitely don't need to do that We
don't need to spend any wasted time
[SPEAKER_04]: leaving the water in the resin in the
water So quick ten minute rip on the
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble now and then pull those bags That
was Very little in that bag almost nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: See that every day although.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of spread out on the screen It's
invisible because of the orange screen in
[SPEAKER_04]: the Sunland.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost couldn't see it
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more resinous now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already moving much easier than that
other stuff was Just pile it into a little
[SPEAKER_04]: spot Very small little 190 Keep that on
and just clean it like that with the
[SPEAKER_04]: easier to clean when it's stretched I
Often clean my buckets my bags stretched
[SPEAKER_04]: over a bucket like that It's it's held in
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no long pieces There's no creases
that hold the bag shot in in weird ways,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just like super quick All right
[SPEAKER_04]: Real small amount of 160 Probably because
it's just so damn good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very little contaminants this herb
Very small
[SPEAKER_04]: little piles But also not important piles
Now we're getting more into an important
[SPEAKER_04]: pile a bag that you want to see some resin
in generally is your 120 It's a nice bag
[SPEAKER_03]: to see a little pile in Never a bad thing
A little pile of
[SPEAKER_04]: some some niceness show the camera here a
little pile of some 120 goodness
[SPEAKER_04]: This teamwork there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making bubble Full melt on our D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nail quartz nails by puking be skill it
tools for me
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bag that we put in the next
bag Yeah, exactly you don't want to lose
[SPEAKER_04]: this resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point to be remembered by
Even this little bit of hash that stuck to
[SPEAKER_04]: the spoon right into the 90 the quality is
there no problem You're definitely not
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminating that bag by any means
putting it
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorites always good when it
lifts up with a lot of water There's about
[SPEAKER_04]: a gallon and a half a gallon and a half of
water in there right now, which tells me
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's covering the screen At least a
little pile This is always nice to get
[SPEAKER_04]: your yield in your 90 bag if you can Never
a bad thing Couple tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: particulates, but if I rinse the bubble
around We should be able to pick them out
[SPEAKER_04]: In a second once I get these little guys
out there's three or four just tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: things that we don't want in there
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you this thing does not
want to pick up whatever it is All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got a bug we'll spray this up you
wanna push that in
[SPEAKER_04]: Just push the bag up put the lip up on the
bag and it makes for easy even easier
[SPEAKER_04]: spring That looks like a nice pile there's
definitely probably three or three grams
[SPEAKER_04]: there I would say Whereas that last 120
was maybe half a gram 73 45 still two more
[SPEAKER_04]: good bags that we're gonna pull Look at
how creamy that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's delicious looking Remember these
ones need to go through the sieve almost
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't leave this out for too long We
can't waste all our time pulling all these
[SPEAKER_04]: bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're gonna have to see some I
think It's beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is like the creme de la creme
sound So there's that I'm thinking what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna do now is potentially strain
that onto our
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we've got our parchment
paper made into a big square here with the
[SPEAKER_04]: edges done up And there's a layer down
here And I suggest we do that 90 micron
[SPEAKER_04]: almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get that done right now All right,
we'll let these guys see what's going on a
[SPEAKER_02]: little closer So I'm just gonna put the
screen right here sure I'm gonna go grab
[SPEAKER_02]: that off of here with the spoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just gonna quickly um, oh It looks
perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks perfect for micro plane edge For
a sieve it for sieve edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always mix the names up Alright,
so there's the the 90 we're gonna gently
[SPEAKER_04]: rub it through the screen and you can see
it's got that perfect right now that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: crumbling perfect so What I would suggest
John Is use the end and you rather than
[SPEAKER_04]: make it awkward on yourself come back
around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you here I can't show you
without showing you there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically use the bottom of the spoon on
the edge of the screen So I'm gonna try
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's gonna come back I'm gonna show
this right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go Now a lot of it right now is
stuck on the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give it a couple wax
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly And see how we put the lip on
there because as he's tapping away the lip
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually protecting it from jumping off
of The lip is working for us very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah quite happy with that Well,
but you know what he's getting a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit excited Well, you got to get a little
excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're cleaning this hash off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want it staying in our sieve We
want it on that parchment getting dried
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was 90 perfection right
there We just let this dry a tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit this last little remnants that are in
here We'll give it a good whack in about
[SPEAKER_04]: two or three minutes And it'll just fall
and cover this look at what beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: coverage we got with that sieve and in the
Sun It looks so nice doesn't it John?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I've done some nice close-ups
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it back to you there my friend
Oh, dude beautiful right there
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely some quality there.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I answer my phone?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my birthday boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's my birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's calling him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's making hash Because that's what he
all right, that's awesome All right,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll be back in a second All right that
didn't that 90 look unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you glad we see that right away?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you right now if that 73 was
still sitting there It'd be a done deal
[SPEAKER_04]: the 120 we could do anytime as well,
but we'll pull these three bags and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: do them all together We'll be quick though
because the 73 is gonna be just much like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be creamy deliciousness That 90
bag just made it all Yeah, like right
[SPEAKER_04]: there and the 73 is doing it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know Just so you know It's
also doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the 73 is looking creamy to a very
cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can I can smell it All right,
let's get that in there I Thought I was
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna pull a rookie move day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you're almost gonna pull a
rookie moves, you know, we do that even
[SPEAKER_04]: being We do we do we do I mean that's the
that's one of the main reasons I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: mess around with chemical solvents but the
fact that they're just Look at this in the
[SPEAKER_04]: sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the color of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what that that oh wow,
that's you Hey, I was going I'll take it
[SPEAKER_02]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't see it in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you guys will bring it to them
We're gonna be like this is going from
[SPEAKER_02]: here directly I'll let you pull that
little chunk out in a second once I get it
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go right there get that guy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is gonna have to go quick All right
want to get the spoons right here Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, this is just like that 90 was Just
like that It even wants to just stay on
[SPEAKER_04]: the spoon let me get off the spoon for you
You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clicked right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that last little badang gave it the
you know, it's almost the same amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: 73 is there isn't a 90 That looks
beautiful It's even like hardening on the
[SPEAKER_04]: spoon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go grab the next screen The next
screens coming up the next screen or the
[SPEAKER_02]: next screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not say the next parchment The
next cardboard and parchment We're hitting
[SPEAKER_04]: gabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for us All right, so we'll take
that guy right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh We can rinse this guy off ASAP because
he's Already starting to dry And that's
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing we talk about is don't let your
screen One of the things they were doing
[SPEAKER_04]: in Spain that I couldn't wrap my head
around That I really was thinking that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just something they shouldn't be
doing and I saw more than one person do it
[SPEAKER_04]: They pulled all their bags out and then
they hung them and leaned them up against
[SPEAKER_04]: one another put them in a bag and High
quality resin is gonna wick moisture just
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting on top of that screen so much that
it'll be very difficult to sieve
[SPEAKER_04]: Microplaning will be one of your only
options at that point and you'll have to
[SPEAKER_04]: of course freeze the resin before you do
that Because it's a warm environment in
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain, especially in Barcelona even in the
winter It's hard To get to a cool
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature that you can actually,
you know, even just plain some some hash
[SPEAKER_04]: Without having it just start melting your
fingers All right, let's rinse your bags
[SPEAKER_04]: very very The older the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's good So we're just giving the
resin a nice the rest is so clean That's
[SPEAKER_04]: like four times the yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like four grams at least I'd
say we've got our ten to twelve grams
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway, John Just from the like two and a
half to the two to three two three four
[SPEAKER_04]: five six Yeah, we've got about ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we still haven't pulled the 25
either though Just give this a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: good squirts to show if there's any
contaminants in there No, it's beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll scoop it all up
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an incredible pile How's that for
not a drop drop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's a nice pile of that's a huge
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even done yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's like Five times of
everything I'd say it's at least five
[SPEAKER_02]: times of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's about six grams just
there
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely close to five 56,
you know, I'm just guesstimating just like
[SPEAKER_04]: you and I'm like, you know, no more
accurate in my guess We're gonna weigh it
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll find out what it's gonna be like
Yeah, we'll definitely let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say we're gonna get that through the
plane real soon if you want to start
[SPEAKER_04]: sieving Yeah, why don't you come over here
and see you while I pull the last bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do the cleaning on this bag I'm gonna
grab this 73 right off the hop sure man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get that going right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good You can blow that off nice and
fast hey Easy going easy going So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a nice easy way to clean bags,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Haha totally digging it
[SPEAKER_04]: All right Excellent excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So remember the cleaner you get your bags
the better it's You get that resin stuck
[SPEAKER_04]: on there and you're the one that's going
to be dealing with it That is the truth of
[SPEAKER_04]: that never a bad idea to just use a little
extra Couple of extra minutes and make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure you get it real dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's looking great John That's the
73.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you could probably afford to
card Just a small section of this over
[SPEAKER_04]: there real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might even be able to do it just with
the lightness I wouldn't touch it with
[SPEAKER_04]: your hands But and then we can put the 120
right here and we'll draw a line And then
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got two more in there that we'll
have to make up I'd say we're gonna need
[SPEAKER_04]: at least a whole one easy easy for that 45
Yeah And I'll pull the 25 bag this is a
[SPEAKER_04]: bag that everyone has a real problem with
a simple technique you can see that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: holding at least three gallons of water,
but a simple technique is to lift it very
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly and The water just releases so a
bag like this generally when I start doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this little jerk upwards method I can
drain it in about 10 seconds Fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_04]: John and we still have more that's sitting
to be run again Like we'll put it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble now again and run another batch
We're not gonna film our second batch,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we will let you know what came of it
And we'll do many cush maybe a little
[SPEAKER_04]: couple days down the road Notice how I
filled the bag with air and slid my hand
[SPEAKER_04]: down the bag to actually get some of that
excess water out Do not physically grab
[SPEAKER_04]: the Hash in the screen and squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not a good idea Just something
that definitely is not a good idea and
[SPEAKER_04]: then finally here we've got our 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah looking good John The 120 look
beautiful The 25 is one of the unique
[SPEAKER_04]: resins that you can actually gather with
the spoon Almost as well as you gather
[SPEAKER_04]: with the spray bottle why that is If it's
the size of the heads obviously it is it's
[SPEAKER_04]: the only thing that's really different
about it Just clean it so well 25 micron
[SPEAKER_04]: The grade that will pay for your bags
whether you want to use it in a metal bowl
[SPEAKER_04]: or a joint or smoke it in a bone I Saw
Franco from strain hunters recently going
[SPEAKER_04]: off on you about you Seth's 25 micron
bubble, so you know that there's something
[SPEAKER_04]: to it There's some actives in there
depending on where it was grown depending
[SPEAKER_04]: on the strain This color of this 25 is
absolutely beautiful Awesome I got water
[SPEAKER_04]: spraying in my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the Sun just This is totally
beautiful Totally awesome birthday Thanks
[SPEAKER_04]: for coming over John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what I mean you always come
over, but what a nice guy to bring the
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh frozen It was something that I yeah,
you know it's I'm gonna you gave me this
[SPEAKER_02]: cut I brought this home Christmas I
brought it here from from my friend Ron's
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, we were laughing about it today It
came home in my pocket in a plastic bag
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go get the second parchment
paper so we can get on seething that 25
[SPEAKER_04]: and that 45 I'll be right back And what
I'm gonna do here is because we know this
[SPEAKER_02]: side here is the 120 and this side here is
the 73 So instead of drawing a line on the
[SPEAKER_02]: paper here, I'm just gonna write it on the
Cardboard gives me an idea I put the 73
[SPEAKER_02]: and The 90 fills up that whole tray and
this 45 is Definitely looking so sweet So
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna wait for mark to come out here
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna move this just all our bags
We've seen the 90 the 120 the 73 and what
[SPEAKER_04]: we have left is the 45 and the 25 we're
Not bothering with the 220 the 190 and
[SPEAKER_04]: 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just swaggles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna pour this water into my garden
down below
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terpene rich What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just put this in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent Oh, I'm about to show them the
loveliness of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, here we go That right there is what
We call quality for 45.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Got a smile on your face Look at me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that your 45 bubble?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Johnny 45?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this your 45?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the 45 John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a beautiful thing For
you my friend Is for you Wow, look at that
[SPEAKER_04]: is for you I Think I think I think listen,
maybe just a little bit tiny little bit if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's no good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let me know If we need to we'll add a
tiny little bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, it's coming through nice it's
sticking so gently give it a gentle little
[SPEAKER_04]: smack on the edge as you move it as you
yeah Oh, yeah, that's perfect John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks unreal here
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably the nicest 45 I've ever
seen It's definitely very nice for me that
[SPEAKER_04]: what I've grown so I mean You can also do
a light scraping on the outside Make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: you move it when you do that or you'll get
clumps though move the whole unit around
[SPEAKER_04]: even towards some of the empty spots So
this is a real important process The
[SPEAKER_04]: sieving or the microplaning we're doing
the sieving technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to keep your tools cool We're
doing this in the sunlight so you guys can
[SPEAKER_04]: see it really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a better idea to do this in a colder
environment Not that it's super duper warm
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, but it's definitely probably 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are 65 to 70 over here Nice
little pile break off another piece and
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of work Yeah, gently sieve it
through the screens, you know there did
[SPEAKER_04]: this did have a little bit more moisture
removed even though it's sieving perfectly
[SPEAKER_04]: If I left a little bit more moisture in it
It would have probably see even a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more perfect both the 90 and the 73
were like that as well But this looks
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna get it all the way through
and you'll be able to To cover this
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment paper nice and evenly So
wherever you see it to be the least amount
[SPEAKER_04]: is where you kind of want to spend some
attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice You like that I like that I moved
the paper open just as you did it I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like team You're like very receptive
to the motions John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We work well together We do get the job
because we're just having a good time
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy because we love what we do We do
love what we do and we seem to be very
[SPEAKER_04]: much alike in our in our just in our
histories and involved with And we just
[SPEAKER_04]: seem so damn happy to share with the
people out there You know what what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: best thing you can do is show people this
yeah, I agree This is my birthday hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the bottom of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, look look at the bottom of that
in the sunlight All right, give it a
[SPEAKER_04]: gentle smack rather than brush it with the
spoon you can smack all most of that off
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I go high like on this on the
top part Looks good And then of course
[SPEAKER_04]: some more loosening of it up as it dries
as we're taking time That bubble will dry
[SPEAKER_04]: out a little bit more and it'll even break
off easier Looking at those empty spots,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think this is our fullest sheet all
right sometimes the little bits that get
[SPEAKER_04]: stuck on the outside you can Gently brush
it off with a spoon or you could use a
[SPEAKER_04]: brush You could also use one of the
anti-static brushes to get this bubble off
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's just a nice even amount We'll
give that a few more good wax on the edge
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Stainless steel strainer with the
spoon real good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a top whack like a nice hard one
Yeah, that's where you see it really
[SPEAKER_04]: start.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how see it bouncing and releasing now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excellent Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got our 45.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna move on to the 25 So
[SPEAKER_04]: we ran out of space on our parchment paper
We don't really want to rip out another
[SPEAKER_04]: batch and the 25 micron of all the hashes
if you get it into a thin enough patty It
[SPEAKER_04]: seems to be the one that can actually dry
in a patty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna do a little experiment just
with the 25 We're gonna leave this little
[SPEAKER_04]: patty as is and we're still gonna get it
onto the wicking Table here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a nice little spot in the corner
of our 45 We'll put it on the parchment
[SPEAKER_04]: there and we'll get back to you and let
you know how that kind of turned out It's
[SPEAKER_04]: been an unbelievable birthday batch with
my amigo Johnny I mean such a good friend
[SPEAKER_04]: comes over with the beautifulness whips
off a batch with me in this in this
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful area that we live and Yeah,
I mean basically the only thing really
[SPEAKER_04]: left to share which I'll end with is the
macro photographs of the resin that we
[SPEAKER_04]: just made You know starting with that 120
micron beautiful heady heads all stuffed
[SPEAKER_04]: Together in little clumps beautiful color
Dropping down into the 90 and suddenly
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like whoa that stuff is surreal
diamond like glistening amazingness With
[SPEAKER_04]: the 73 looking almost exactly like the 90
to the naked eye I expect that it'll look
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty beautiful under the macro lens and
then down into the 45 and I'll shoot the
[SPEAKER_04]: patty 25 and we'll share all this
greatness with you guys So once again
[SPEAKER_04]: John, thanks for coming out Such a fucking
pleasure, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always a pleasure hanging with you Bro,
I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited too.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was this was a great day and a great
birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Thanks everyone for watching We'll talk
to you soon on bubble man's world Come on
[SPEAKER_01]: to a birthday party near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace Those
[SPEAKER_04]: are my bird friends They're saying John
bubble man share that 90 90 90 90 90 90 90
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 micron We will Peace You You You
