[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going there from Fresh
Heady's Limited and the creators of bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here today to show you what we do
with rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you out there know that I smoke
only hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't smoked herb, cannabis for over
10 years, close to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I'm the distributor for the
hoodlum jackets, they come with a rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: paper insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a pack right here of the raws that I
pulled out of one of my jackets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice raw organic, the natural way
to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't smoke paper or glue,
but what I do do with rolling papers is I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little trick that I sort of learned
many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take a normal size rolling paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a king size, but it should work as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you fold up the bottom edge just above
the amount that would be glue on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's folded up and then we bend it
down just to put a crease in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do the same thing with the
top of the glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bend that down and put a
crease in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to do the same thing
to the edges, about the same amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the amount of glue that's on
there or whatever that is, a quarter of an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make that nice and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your nails to really make the crease
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, do the other last corner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this one looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to just twist up the two
corners, kind of just triangulate them
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this one looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we hold the middle of it on
our finger and we spin the rolling paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spin for me, spin for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit too creased there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get it on camera for
you because it really does look pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool when you make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can easily do this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming back around, spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the rolling paper trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I've got you here, I've got some
really nice bubble shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been curing for about five years
in my bubble box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has absolutely shattered it right
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just pull out a tiny little bit of
three screen sift to throw on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got some nice shatter loaded
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just obsidian black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you guys could see it from where
you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking with Beeline today,
as I do every day, thanks to Hash Bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: who turned me on to Beeline a few years
ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it pretty much endlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Nate Dizzle for this
beautiful Swiss perk that he gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years ago when I went to Germany
with him and Steve Hopps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, bubbly bubbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
