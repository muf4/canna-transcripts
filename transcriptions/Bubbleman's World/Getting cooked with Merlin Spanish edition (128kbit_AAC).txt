[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin and I
[SPEAKER_07]: are joining forces here at the Saint
Joseph La Boqueria, the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Off the ramblas, ramblas behind us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the craziest, busiest fucking
market ever to meet a person at.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably not the best idea if you're
not from Barcelona to meet your friends at
[SPEAKER_07]: the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's go fucking pick some food for
getting cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to lead the way?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we making ceviche tonight?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like this, right here even.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at all this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty crazy, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fresh cut fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try and find the fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some artichokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to do a couple of rounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of places selling the same stuff,
eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: God, it smells so good, that fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_08]: This chicken is not a spice lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's just trying to find the fish
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you like, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some cheese?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I get like a... What do you suggest?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like like three different cheeses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something low.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit, is this like caramel or
chocolate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's fudge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those kiwis.
[SPEAKER_03]: One this way and one the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some langostinos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to film you, Merl.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're buying stuff for the dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we getting cooked with Merlin?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting cooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're already cooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: 64 jars deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the olive store here, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, how about these artichokes?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's artichokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: This place is insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just finishing these people off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a bag somewhere?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a little more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some nice veggies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here is where we were earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're going this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can go this way, back this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: How
[SPEAKER_04]: do we get out of here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look at this, Merl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Merl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Merlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the woman that let you wash her
hands at her sink.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at her salt.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all salt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barcelona original salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which salt do you go best with the fish or
the dogs?
[SPEAKER_08]: So
[SPEAKER_02]: you've gotten back from the market,
Merlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the bread, the tuna, the cheese,
the artichokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: These fucking mangoes are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these plums, lemons, potatoes,
oranges, aubergine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Olives, olive oil, heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big old artichoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Morels and chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sea asparagus and a bunch of microgreens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not been hitting many dabs on
camera, which I apologize for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to do more of.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just took the most beautiful dab,
number 17.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smells like fucking bananas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Merlin is prepping the
foodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, this is like deja vu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooked with Merlin and Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to come join you in a minute
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I haven't been filming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Merlin's been busting ass over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's already got the egg, the aubergines.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's opened up and salted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you did?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and then you've got some water boiling
over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the artichoke in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Artichoke?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to blanch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Slice it and fry it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blanch that motherfucker up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've got some leeks frying here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're frying leeks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be from the pasta with the
clams.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we've got mushrooms coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe you don't have a joint
blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's throwing me off a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we go to Choco?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to keep going on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have some in my bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll twist you up a fatty if you have
some.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little edible flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This just looks great.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, the last touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got that charcoal salt?
[SPEAKER_07]: That charcoal salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Charcoal sea salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: On a real mixed dish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks delicious, my man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mediterranean ingredients with Merlin's
salt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zest for cooking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blocking the way, and I'm blocking the
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need some B footage of this shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: 5,000 square meter greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's great, 5,000 square meters.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have a 300 foot square foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to hear more about that thing that
you were talking about, that patent you
[SPEAKER_10]: got.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got my transdermal pad?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll give you the full pitch then.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Alex?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to remember I got your name
right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the transdermal pad, it's quite
something, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're still going over here, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
A little eggplant, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spanish eggplant?
[SPEAKER_08]: Eggplant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Cajun dressing for you.
It's going to be so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balcony.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks like a sauna.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little balcony though, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you got going on now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some pasta, some potatoes, bravos.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Want some potato?
[SPEAKER_08]: Got some mushrooms, got some rels,
got some leeks, got some fried artichokes.
[SPEAKER_08]: This shit's fogging up, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that tapas that you just put on
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Potatoes, bravos with yogurt dill sauce.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't say potatoes, bravos.
[SPEAKER_10]: You say patato situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's patatas.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you said it was cactus though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cactus, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks yummy.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, getting cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cajun pasta is in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pasta, clams, and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, let me see those langostinos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cajun langostinos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Black salt in it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That even made a nice sound.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want me to take two of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amigos.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to finish it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't feel bad about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just cooked it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: My God.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called grape gas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grape gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cultivated by a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Zach, and he grows living soil
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Living soil indoors.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunch of rounds in the same bed,
and his product is just stunning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything from his garden just sounds
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you all know, I didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just separated the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the rosman.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do nano-oxygenation for our soil now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of like cold, cured hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played with the texture here a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never whipped hash when we decided to
whip a little bit this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that's stunning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bravo, Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stunning.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're finishing it off with some of these,
what are they?
[SPEAKER_07]: Macarons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Macarons.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of dates?
[SPEAKER_07]: Jewel dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jewel dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Medjool dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Medjool dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Medjool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a French big word.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a metal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like aluminum or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, aluminum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you squeeze it so it's like air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's air soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not air soft, it's plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it hurts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it hurts.
Now it hurts.
Now it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it hurts.
