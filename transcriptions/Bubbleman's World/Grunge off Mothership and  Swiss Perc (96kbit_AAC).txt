[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to have you here with me on this
beautiful almost fall morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sort of switched here in
British Columbia in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days and we went from our epic beautiful
weather to burr cold weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This morning I wanted to tell you about a
cool product called Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Grunge Off is a friend of mine's
company, Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He owns this down in California and it is
quite a cleaning technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Options for cleaning our bongs,
our dirty bongs, we know that we,
[SPEAKER_01]: after smoking for a little while,
especially with the D-nails, you get this
[SPEAKER_01]: reclaim melting down the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be quite difficult to get off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get quite a bit of, I mean this is
just a hash bong so it's not going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: as dirty as some of the herb bongs that
you guys might be used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've done is I've taken the
mothership and I've soaked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Grunge Off, okay, when you first
buy Grunge Off, it's going to be a much
[SPEAKER_01]: golder color.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great things about Grunge Off
is that you can use it for a multitude of
[SPEAKER_01]: uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to just use it once or
twice but you can use it literally like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred or five hundred times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this particular Grunge Off that
I've been using, it's been used quite
[SPEAKER_01]: often and it's therefore the color of the
resin has mixed into the Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from what I know about Grunge Off,
it is a enzyme from a soybean,
[SPEAKER_01]: something extracted from the soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you can purchase this product
at Home Depot or some of those type of
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cleaning oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Richard's done is he's taken it
and he's marketed it to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice small box, bottles, nice small bottle
that you get and you buy them in,
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it in a case personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you an idea here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clean out this particular
unit and I'm going to pour it into this
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never got to see how dirty this one
was so what I figured I would do is we
[SPEAKER_01]: would pour Grunge Off into this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would let it settle for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing about Grunge Off is it
doesn't clean like ISO and rock salt where
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it clean and you're going to
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake and get
[SPEAKER_01]: it real clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like an end of the night thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill your bong with the Grunge Off,
you wake up the next morning and simply
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pour this into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the mothership to the Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being very gentle when touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so that's just coming right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more room in the mothership than in
the Swiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll just rinse this little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see he's still got darkness and
there's still spots where he's been dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're just going to rinse him with
some warm water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rinse off that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you notice when you start
playing with the Grunge Off is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very slippery stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please hold onto your pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hate to hear a story that someone
was Grunge Offing their piece and lost it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Saint Gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it a tiny little bit of a shake but
not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part the majority of the work
is going to have been done overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use nice hot water as well when I'm
doing this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see right off the bat that it's
90% clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit more resin in the
stem that I'll probably be able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: off with a sharp skillet tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you clean it often, if you clean
your pipe often, you won't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary and third tertiary cleans
because literally the first one will do
[SPEAKER_01]: the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I'll give you a little
wipe-see and show you what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tiny little bit of specks still
in the can I can see and a few nice marks
[SPEAKER_01]: of resin right where the nail sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part that's a pretty good
clean right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Grunge Off So normally now what I
would do is I would either using a
[SPEAKER_01]: toothpick or using a small piece I would
pick away these little pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are only here because I waited so
long to clean my piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly didn't have to wait the three
days that I waited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually one day is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just getting the toothpick out
and you can see once the bong is real nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and warm and you've grunged off the
majority of it, that resin just comes off
[SPEAKER_01]: real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy on a toothpick, which it'll almost
never just rinse off with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this little bit of help is going to be
key if you want to get those last little
[SPEAKER_01]: drops of resin off off of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that I'm working that and
turned a multitude of times to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: last little bit of resin out of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_01]: Got quite a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's just the tiniest
little bit left here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on how OCD you want your
bong, it's just a matter of giving it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also noticed that from my bong putting
it down there's a lot of hash on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside here so we'll also give that a
little bit of a clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice big base on this mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: It catches hash sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that doesn't make it into the bowl or
other times it's just hash that's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, there's a nice clean
mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let this guy sit for about
maybe an hour or two, which isn't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of time I like to let it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overnight is great, but I'm going to let
it sit for an hour or two and then I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come back and we're going to show
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be our grunge off segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can pick up grunge off at
freshheadies.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell it on our website there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, if you guys have any questions,
please put them in the comment sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's just a comment or a critique,
throw it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, hopefully we'll see a bunch of
you guys next Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be doing Hash Church episode
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a live stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please be good if you come into the
chat on video and understand that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't have a TV or a radio or any music
playing because we are streaming live.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let the grunge off soak for a couple
of hours, not as long as I normally would,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's safe to say we can take
this grunge off and place it back into the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a quick water rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just a two hour soak and we
pretty much got everything from a
[SPEAKER_01]: distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably looks like a fairly nice clean
piece up close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's still some marks where
the water was and there's still a little
[SPEAKER_01]: reclaim in the downstem and a little piece
of hash that I have stuck on the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but not a bad job for the grunge
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would have left it overnight,
it would be even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, I can clean off that easy
enough with a toothpick, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: after I've already heated it up and used
the grunge off as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just softens it up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has stick, so you have to
actually physically remove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grunge off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
