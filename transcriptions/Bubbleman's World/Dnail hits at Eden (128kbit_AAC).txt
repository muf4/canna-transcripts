[SPEAKER_01]: We're here at Eden and we got some good
friends and we're dabbing it up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting some full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here at Eden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in downtown Vancouver and we've got
the brand new D-nail that just got sent
[SPEAKER_01]: out to us from Brian and Stevie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out D-nail on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Quartz nail that we're using
instead of the titanium one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hitting it for a while with the
screen on top, but I think we pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out that the Quartz is where the
flavor's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Flav421 with me with some sick glass
here tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got John Burfella with secure 99%
tri-comb heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're going to hit a bowl
out of the D-nail and the Ruer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Ruer collab is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, John Burfella.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best one is the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's going to hit the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely see that they're both
pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste is absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: 801, 802, 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really holding the variable within two,
three degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flav's ready for his.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double hit him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double hit him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, super stoked with the D-nail so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a showcase on it in the
next Bubble Man World Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll sort of talk about it in a choir
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, stay melty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get out of here.
