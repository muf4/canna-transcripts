Hey,
[SPEAKER_06]: welcome everyone to bubble man's world and
welcome Johnny B in the house for the
[SPEAKER_06]: first time in forever Dude, let's call
this a puff Wednesday It's a chill puff
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday, my neighbors ripping out all
the trees in his on his property So that
[SPEAKER_06]: annoying beeping sound we're gonna hear
that consistently through this video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe but that's okay I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're gonna start it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny has not tried the bubble man pen
yet I haven't even opened it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hitting mine like he's sitting
there hitting it He gave unwrap the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrapper and I'm like, I can't do this
without you guys Pull it open man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I broke the rib.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is it's hard packaging for broken
ribs It's amazing how much that rib really
[SPEAKER_03]: affects your life and how much resin you
need and not to cough coughing I Just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what else to say that I have
not gone and yet yet that has a little
[SPEAKER_03]: explanation card Props to Gary from up
tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all him prop Gary Props to Gary
props Gary here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put on your good cartridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got one that's already filled up
Yeah, we filled you up a cartridge here
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B That you a cartridge here it's in
the bag Yeah, really got pushed in good so
[SPEAKER_03]: this is cool, you know what I like so much
about it is um, dude You signed it well in
[SPEAKER_03]: a sense I did didn't I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm honored to be able to screw this
on we talked so much about it I know like
[SPEAKER_03]: even when we're in in Jamaica Tony was
talking about it you guys to be back and
[SPEAKER_03]: forth and Is it one two three?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you turn on?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a five five Turns it on Ready I am
You take a few seconds to load the
[SPEAKER_06]: cartridge you'll probably have to slowly,
you know pull in gentle while you're
[SPEAKER_06]: heating up the oil Now which is obviously
quite cold on the outside of the cartridge
[SPEAKER_06]: right now on the inside of the cartridge
It's just starting to melt I Can feel it
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll take a little bit you want to heat
this up good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Yeah, it's going good starting to start
to feel warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that'll boil that rosin at the
bottom Pull it into the cartridge and it
[SPEAKER_06]: might take a few more.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but this flavor right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one Well, like great whenever
you had a break something in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got it sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like breaking in your new pen It's
like gotta break stuff in.
Yeah It's
[SPEAKER_06]: just starting to melt down No,
it's on I smelt the turps It's boiling at
[SPEAKER_06]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's pulling now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pulling into the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm watching you pull oil into the
cartridge for the first time Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Wow, it's bubbling and the bubbles are
getting pulled into the cartridge So this
[SPEAKER_06]: cartridge is a little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing you need to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B took a little bit but he finally
got one so with this cartridge in
[SPEAKER_06]: particular when I gave him the cartridge
the oil was very hard like cold So you've
[SPEAKER_06]: got to heat it up a little bit You've got
to boil the oil on the bottom and once it
[SPEAKER_06]: boils it goes into these holes that are
over the beat Now here's the most
[SPEAKER_06]: important part God that smells incredible
Pull on it when you're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pull on it right now without pushing
the button It's a very important part
[SPEAKER_06]: without pushing the button You're gonna
pull a few times and what that does is it
[SPEAKER_06]: pulls the oil back into the cartridge It
cools the oil and it keeps the oil from
[SPEAKER_06]: dripping And so if you hit these pens a
lot and you don't do what John's doing
[SPEAKER_06]: right now What's gonna happen is the oil
is gonna drip down your battery and this
[SPEAKER_06]: is what happens with a lot of these tanks
We found a very simple way to avoid it
[SPEAKER_06]: happening completely Cool the oil down a
little bit before before you finish using
[SPEAKER_06]: your pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the end of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been smoking mine this one same
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been puffing this since Since
Toronto since the Karma Cup September 9th,
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's like 10 almost 10 days
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a proper pen sounds like we got
to get you trying to beat my buddy I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: just starting to get to the end of mine
now Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you got that pen Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked that it's working for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we'll look forward to Hearing
about your critiques in the near future of
[SPEAKER_03]: how it works for you We've taken pens
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking on half-church.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone through you've seen the lineup
of pens that I've destroyed I've seen your
[SPEAKER_06]: lineup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's I see that was still rocking I
dropped this out of my truck from six feet
[SPEAKER_06]: in the like out of the pocket standing in
the back of my truck and it fell right on
[SPEAKER_06]: the The driveway and it just put a little
dent and somehow I got another dent right
[SPEAKER_06]: here I haven't broken a piece of glass yet
and I've dropped it about 15 times Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's interesting how this one could fall
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually doesn't affect the glass
That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see part of the design.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the design where all the
other ones fall on the glass and break the
[SPEAKER_03]: glass I mean, can I stuff one of these
bags full of stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is what we're gonna do right
now We're gonna pre Johnny wanted to while
[SPEAKER_06]: he wanted to take a little bit of his Medi
Kush, which is absolutely spectacular here
[SPEAKER_06]: real nice cushy gassy kind of got that
Beautiful jarred flavor nice dense
[SPEAKER_06]: nuggets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the real key to this is preparation so
you've got to figure out what you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: press whether it's two grams or five grams
or whatnot and Then we'll prepare the bud
[SPEAKER_06]: because Matt from Sasquatch was really
showing the importance of breaking the
[SPEAKER_06]: buds into smaller pieces and filling the
corners Getting those corners and the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole side stuffed so that you don't have
anywhere for oil And I think five grams
[SPEAKER_06]: would be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right about there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah point two.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go I'm gonna go four point two,
but we'll go five point two.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that's I think that'll work
really well So if you just want to gently
[SPEAKER_06]: break your number We'll start throwing it
into this bag little pieces and I can So,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I really kind of look at looking at break
it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that Yeah, no, no, it's like I
hate breaking it He's like there's like it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like there's a bunch of sand here
right now from just cracking that bud So
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really important and that's one thing
I'm learning because I don't really use
[SPEAKER_03]: the bags I just press bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep I press bud for a while when I press
like five or ten Grams of bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like having the bag I know that my
pressing is on point enough that I can
[SPEAKER_06]: escape the oil get the oil out It's only
really when you get inefficient that
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll leave oil behind in these bags and
so and for me I'm always using like the
[SPEAKER_03]: hair straightener, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I've always used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that just it kind of kind of
makes sense I don't use a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a can of clamp now I used a bag even
with my hair straighteners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still had little bags that I used First
first press I ever did was wrapped in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little that was right to my crown bag
That's why I still have the 25 I have
[SPEAKER_06]: access to screen So it makes sense that I
would use bags a lot of people when it's
[SPEAKER_06]: easy not to use bags when a you don't have
a schwack of them But when you have a
[SPEAKER_06]: schwack of them, it's hard not to use them
especially when you have a microscope like
[SPEAKER_06]: mine and I go to photograph the resin and
I see these little bits and pieces and I
[SPEAKER_06]: know in the long run of likes Inhaling
vaporizing and it's not really affecting
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from the photography standpoint,
it really affects it Great deal This has
[SPEAKER_03]: had like a two and a half month cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, it's definitely got a very nice
cure to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells I'm excited to do a little Medi
Kush press here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I Like the you've been waiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I've been waiting None to be missed
It's good having a little short puff
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have been asking for it for the
longest time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea Let's get that all in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea when it would possibly
happen But today John was able to make it
[SPEAKER_06]: over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you were in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in town that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He flies I fly you're somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true There's so many events so
many things happening I mean you got some
[SPEAKER_03]: great great things happening coming up in
the near future here You're going to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion and talking more about what the
ACC Yeah, yeah, those guys are doing good
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely excited I think we're doing
that in the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put the link up to those things To
that organization Corey and Tony doing
[SPEAKER_06]: great things in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna be doing they're doing
education So they're having gatherings
[SPEAKER_06]: where they have people over and
specialists in their fields to talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: the different Aspects of whether you're
they're doing edibles whether they're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing hash making and so I'm gonna do a
little trichome Seminar and then I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: run them through the bubble bags while
they actually run a batch So should be
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think they're John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Many cush doesn't that just is that a
pillow that you could sleep with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Five grams All right, so I guess the plan
is for us to actually have a rip we had
[SPEAKER_06]: our pan rips, but let's have a dab Let's
do it to offer you a dab John.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually I was also gonna say this is a
69% It definitely feels like it has a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's crunchy in
any way shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very Formable malleable if you would
And this is just the humidity I like that
[SPEAKER_03]: was curing my room and I took some buds
off the plant loves curing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at my dehumidifier on the wall
and it had like it was at 70% and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like went inside that squish and I was
like That's pretty awesome All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little dabby for you of this
sauce from blind-eye productions,
[SPEAKER_06]: thanks guys and Johnny B dab Not too big
because we don't want to hurt his rib
[SPEAKER_06]: John's got hurt rib right now So we're
just gonna give him them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a monster one not like a giant
monster one, but it's not monster at all
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a nice little guy for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess we use this as the carb cap I
forgot the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do you count?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am counting you've got about 20
seconds to 29 seconds so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I should have put that over a little
closer to you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Big bangers yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of waiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're hard to find DC glass has
them They're available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't buy stuff on Well,
that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to find probably reason why I
don't have one Yes drop that in there pull
[SPEAKER_06]: that glass against the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Proper ripping right there That's
proper ripping Johnny cut it smells just
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculous Ridiculous ridiculous We'll do
a little DC glass cleaner on the DC banger
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit like the dapper pretty cool
dapper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dapper never It's not bad is it
that's got some really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah No shit, that's turf sauce That is
turtle sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's pink panther kush
with bubba kush or no, sorry pink kush
[SPEAKER_06]: Turpenes added from a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: See that's the best thing now We only take
the raws and and then you buy the turps
[SPEAKER_03]: That first rip you got off your pen was
monster It's what we like All right,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I'm gonna have a little dab with you
there and then we're gonna take that We're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna go into the office and we're gonna
stick that on the M1 I could also bring
[SPEAKER_06]: the M1 out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy enough M1 so portable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing It's insane actually,
it's 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know We'll see it might just stay on my
desk, but I'm gonna have this rip first
[SPEAKER_06]: and Johnny B will be hitting his pen
because this is a puff Wednesday not a not
[SPEAKER_06]: puff Wednesday We puff on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We puff on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually I puff every day, but
Wednesdays are special days special puff
[SPEAKER_06]: day I'm looking forward to seeing the Medi
kush squish through the Sasquatch press I
[SPEAKER_03]: am so looking forward to it because I'd be
squishing at home and I'd be testing all
[SPEAKER_03]: These different things but I haven't had a
chance to sit down with the Sasquatch and
[SPEAKER_03]: truly Test my resin because we know that
the Sasquatch is giving us exactly what we
[SPEAKER_03]: need It's getting all of that resin out
where like like I use a handheld clamp and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not as powerful as a Sasquatch So I'm
dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know how much resin I'm actually
losing You know, like that's the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: question when you're not using the proper
tools You actually lose in the squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find out exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think your return will be What
do you think it'll be 25 or so numbers so
[SPEAKER_06]: good that John was putting that on the
scale of multitude of times because
[SPEAKER_06]: Somehow in our stone stupor we filled this
with six grams instead of five that would
[SPEAKER_03]: Really affected the a Little stone,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do you want to go press this idea?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go do it All right,
so we've got the M1 Sasquatch press that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're gonna be using today with the SPX
power team This one's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's substantially better than the
original one the ES co which I have right
[SPEAKER_06]: here This one you have to pump twice for
every one that you have to pump this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also got my Foot pedal in the
background and my D walled air compressor
[SPEAKER_06]: right here, but that runs the bubble man
world V2 here that I have we're not gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: be using that one today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna be using the M1 and Johnny B
usually clicks out at about 230 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: when he squishes his bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So today we're gonna test he's using a you
know, a handheld unit we're using an
[SPEAKER_06]: actual Product release from Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what the difference is in
regards to returns.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got five grams of Medi Kush that
we've got in here and Yeah, I guess it's
[SPEAKER_06]: time to get it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you say John?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, so I Love the fact that they can
just handle First you have to put the air
[SPEAKER_06]: in so now a couple of pumps is just to
like relief really, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so now you'll see it's only a few
pumps That it takes That's so cool how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going by the hand So it's just kind
of like when I'm using my my girl What's
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sitting at home and I had my
clamp between my legs I pull up my hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener I clip everything together
and it's just just the way the function
[SPEAKER_03]: Squish for like two I Just don't see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I see Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yep want to lift this out Press one Let's
go see what we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at the quality of it though,
Johnny B
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks incredible Smells incredible You'll
be dabbing it soon enough We'll be dabbing
[SPEAKER_04]: it soon You're correct The second squish
second squish I already see it getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: little shiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a pre squish You taught me
the pre squish.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that I Already see oil we
haven't even really begun the square so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's quite likely that you'll get a
Another point five out of this instantly
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see it's already squishing Yeah,
it's squishing pretty good See I would
[SPEAKER_03]: have never known to press it the second
time Well often you can get the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: press in the first time but it's all about
the sweet spot, you know, I think for the
[SPEAKER_06]: Humidity that you had in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have made it a little Hotter I
think that's why the 220 230 is working
[SPEAKER_06]: for you because you have so much excessive
humidity in there that you're just
[SPEAKER_06]: blasting it It's it's evaporating and then
it's carrying the resonant for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might make a lot more sense See how
much nicer now that all that humidity is
[SPEAKER_03]: gone how it's squishing And that's You can
definitely see it gushing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know learning and learning about
humidity is Really key to like and like I
[SPEAKER_03]: said, I didn't really know so I really
wanted to try it on the soft tools You
[SPEAKER_03]: know different tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different tools I wouldn't try to
change it for what you're using because it
[SPEAKER_06]: won't be probably as efficient You know,
you figured out a way to get what you have
[SPEAKER_03]: working efficiently That's good this is
what I kind of want to see the beginning I
[SPEAKER_03]: was a little disappointed but they said
the second squished like the second pull
[SPEAKER_03]: on the bed always seem to get You know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you get that First little really
nice, but it's always that second pull.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember squish once Squish twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or you know, eventually you could
get to your point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean if we squished a 24% I probably
would have been like I think we got it
[SPEAKER_06]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that does happen All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready to crack it open?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cracking it open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah See there in a little and they
kind of bursted a tiny bit so here at the
[SPEAKER_01]: back here there you go All right,
I'll see the back we're gonna weigh this
[SPEAKER_03]: up the first bit Here was that point five
and we'll check on the second bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes collect it up It's already turning to
a shatter like substance as well So
[SPEAKER_01]: another point five got you 20% point six
even That's solid it's pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful view, isn't that gorgeous?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm the camera guy right now So I
get to come out here and take a look at
[SPEAKER_03]: that sun shining But it's definitely just
one of those views that are epic Get to
[SPEAKER_03]: see us all the time Very nice
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty awesome Yeah, that was
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a couple of half gram squishes real
nice done there and once again,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're teaching me stuff Well,
we're learning stuff together stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got our pens.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's uh, let's hit some of that first
batch My goodness look at this many push
[SPEAKER_06]: for the win
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard like hard saffy it's hard like
taffy like taffy It does pull like a taffy
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know that taffy we can snap it
or pulls nicely Jesus Christ be careful
[SPEAKER_06]: with that You want to put that somewhere
so far away from me I'm just taking a nice
[SPEAKER_06]: little baby one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do lots of those a little baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what quite happy Happy to see
how that was squishing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always happy My timer my phone I
figured you might actually have one of
[SPEAKER_03]: these figured you'd be all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really work that well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what the time is Is it
an iPhone it's a swipe up from the bottom
[SPEAKER_06]: even from the closed screen What the hell
was that shit I had no idea You can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually I think your phone just died Am I
wrong or can I just not see?
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is All right, so give me 20
seconds to keep this up 20 seconds for the
[SPEAKER_03]: heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always question the heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you make it red hot?
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it so glowing so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta put on glasses It depends on the
size of the banger depends on the size of
[SPEAKER_03]: the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a double XL banger His isn't going
red in 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm definitely not that's what I've
been doing and then I wait another I wait
[SPEAKER_06]: another 50 stone You can leave it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wait another 50 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at a minute 10 seconds, I'll hit my
death now I have a quartz banger at home
[SPEAKER_03]: is that kind of like it's like degrading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird So I had a question
about it We were actually talking to well,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually Elena was talking to some other
glassblowers and and These cheaper quartz
[SPEAKER_03]: bangers they're basically crushed quartz
and they're made in China and then they're
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of fused together So they do over
time degrading start coming apart like
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if you heat it up red hot and
then Chaz the banger heat it up red hot So
[SPEAKER_03]: as you know, mine are coming apart as you
can hear what's going on here You've got
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole you've got the breakdown though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why it's happening But I had to
you know, you gotta learn that stuff So
