[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here sitting in traffic at the
current moment next to a postal vehicle,
[SPEAKER_02]: one that probably has cannabis in it
thanks to the wonderful programs here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada that you can buy and ship herb
through the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, tons of dispensaries are
doing it through civil disobedience and I
[SPEAKER_02]: support them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, today I'm going to be heading down
to see D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see some cops ahead of me now are in
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting for a train right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the po-po.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like they are going to go bust
people that are turning around and
[SPEAKER_02]: cranking illegal 180s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what is going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, in the meantime, I'm heading over
to see D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a real chill day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure on what level that's
going to mean, what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly, but yeah, we're going to puff
some bowls, eat some food, tell some
[SPEAKER_02]: stories, film a little video, and I
figured I would just start this video off
[SPEAKER_02]: right here in my truck while I was sitting
and waiting and watching everyone do
[SPEAKER_02]: U-turns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Postal truck says, fuck no, I am out of
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's doing the 12 point turn as is the
minivan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like the train just stopped right in
front of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just got people turning around and
going the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I'm going to do,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys at D's.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I am now on commercial drive
heading over to D420K's place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool spot in Vancouver if you've
never been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very eclectic little area, lots of cool
little shops worth checking out for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heading up the stairs to the top floor,
the penthouse, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll puff some bowls with D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going down?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to filming or not
filming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made it here to D420K's as you saw when I
walked in the door and he was eating
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you were eating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had our technical difficulties
getting everything going today,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are here at D's city apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got three flavors of terpenes along
with three flavors of rosin that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: pressed out pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little clamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavors we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got trainwreck, locomotion,
which is a New York diesel trainwreck
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the OJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got three nice things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got three nice things that we're
going to put together with those three
[SPEAKER_02]: nice things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the Jack Frost terpenes,
the OG Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had this since we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a year since we had this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that on our terp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it had to be, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super citrusy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste it when you smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those ones that I think if
I had a big enough bottle and you took a
[SPEAKER_02]: big enough whiff, it would make you feel
sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I brought... Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoda was the one that did that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me feel sick in my tummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, Clementine's going to do
us fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember when we were doing the terp
deck gullet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to smell what you're actually
smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to putting it into words and
experience the actual, like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've managed to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop out of each one and drop it into the
clean vial so we don't have to dip into
[SPEAKER_02]: the fresh vial's lavender skunk from Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one has a real nice, unique,
very, like... Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from here I'm smelling that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so nice to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when I've walked in the grow
rooms and smelled and gone up and seen
[SPEAKER_00]: these frosty nugs and touched one of them
and then smelled my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how fresh... Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How nice that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue River.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we start it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Jack Frost should go with...
What's the first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, trainwreck, I say we do Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your locomotion?
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we citrus it up even more with Jack
Frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really going to go nicely
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That orange and that Jack Frost lemony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm thinking OG and that lavender
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really kick the OG up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it to a whole different level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you pull off the first hit of
whatever you yourself want to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a little... Clean it up a little
bit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your tack a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice press.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Larger, small or medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Medium's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do three in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, three mediums should give us a good
little vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little head space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was... Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, trainwreck we're going to put together
with Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine, yeah.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my darling Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not hit this one myself yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to do a nice little dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going in heavy, heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine for the win.
[SPEAKER_02]: D420K going in deep on the trainwreck
Rosendipton Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climb terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to lose on that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the climb with the clean drop down
and the D-nail and the puking beagle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The puking beagle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to say it's named puking
because it sounds weird to say puking,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's the name of the company,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice staple raws and real pull and snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that Clementine?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just gets the... This part of my head
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of... There's pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a heavy pressure, like a headache,
but like my brain's been hit with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's not part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to join you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a clean on the bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know how you love your clean
rigs to smoke out of and clean drop downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when we're hitting... Oh my
God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like it just... Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what was nice about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the undertone taste of the
trainwreck that I got on my tongue and my
[SPEAKER_02]: throat a few seconds after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's a good combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's going to be nice is when
we have it set up, we have our vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges and our night clubs, day clubs,
whatever, smoking areas, that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to do this so legally that it's
just like going to a winery or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, it'll be when you don't have to
bring... Can you imagine as a wine drinker
[SPEAKER_02]: having to bring your glass?
[SPEAKER_02]: How absurd that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, imagine you get to the point
where you go to your joeys and you order
[SPEAKER_02]: your food, but afterwards you order up
your mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hit a tourist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sub nine inch, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it would be a cool thing the way
these places have money invested in wine
[SPEAKER_02]: and alcohol culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it invested into cannabis culture
because we're a legitimate economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a legitimate marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this economy would change everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well look, we did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, mothership exists regardless of
whether... What about the places where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can bring your own bottles of wine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and pay corking fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pay a corking fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I would pay to bring my own rosins
or my own turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pay that fee, but I don't want to
have to bring my glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love the idea of these,
you know, a proper high-end lounge that
[SPEAKER_02]: can offer you really nice glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that's a little bit
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had a little influencing on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, when I step by the line, you don't
see the stuff off camera, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He beats the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm violent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Wayne Brady going to have to choke a
bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those turps were sizzling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got very, very nicely medicated off that
first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right away, I did a lot of
shoveling yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melting snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melting snow shoveling, the worst kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Citrus galore blew your lung out?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with the flavor profile
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a big enough rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might have been a little bit
too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too big's better than too small,
let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how the turps are... That's
citrus on those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Frost, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the citrus undertone of that
locomotion, the New York diesel train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck crossed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very Calio-esque, if you haven't had these
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very Calio-esque.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange, like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fucking treat that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how the turpings are so strong,
and then the raws hit you afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste both profiles, both flavors
together and separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's that Calio coming in,
that New York City diesel flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, in my cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste it back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love when we get together and hit
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was... Well, usually when we get
together, we're hitting turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: rawsing, or hash, and pigging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That almost seemed like a bowl of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like more than a hash or an oil or an
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like a full bouquet of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't say that I vaporized it or
smoked it, because it doesn't taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like I ate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just ate a couple of ounces of bud
without the shit stuck in my teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dare we finish it off with a lavender
stump and an OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to hit this one as large as
I did the last one, because I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the one thing I'll say,
it's always fun to hit big rips,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will say that while filming and
trying to make each scene happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with turp dips, I'm always
happy with a small to medium one.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day we will have to film a show where
we just take monster ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the show will be about how destroyed
we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: My very first, I think, debut into the
YouTube world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ!
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were excited about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all like, let's just blow our
heads off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I fucking shotgunned her, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so lavender skunk, our final
Blue River terpene cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all available actually right now
at BlueRiverExtracts.ca.
[SPEAKER_02]: BlueRiverExtracts.com, Tony's company,
is down right now, but they should be up
[SPEAKER_02]: again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in Canada, give us a shout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpaderps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that lavender skunk is very
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of a bud I can't remember
the name of, but I absolutely grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know, I did too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it reminds me of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so trippy that that history of our
history was, you know, it's still there in
[SPEAKER_02]: the memory of the smell and whatnot,
but too bad we didn't have the GCs and we
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't testing for the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have loved to have known that
information back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine where it'd be now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third rip, D420K, terp rip, bong rip,
terp dip, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming at you live through the mothership
climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I start exhaling, I don't even
want to exhale the whole thing because I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to just keep it in my mouth chewing
on it like a fucking good piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good piece of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy taste, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, plus, the OG Cush Rosin is strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's narcotic, like, wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: That combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of pee there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a dribblet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got me a little excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go in and try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That impressed the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I started exhaling my toke,
I could taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's something unique in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that there's something in
there that we don't see very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a terpene in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you what they're going to say is
like, oh, that's a rare one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one that's found in a much lower ratio
or even more possible is that it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination of two or three common ones in
a unique ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep in the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going deep, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, I'm completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I'm not completely fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really quite enjoyably medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, but hungry medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to head down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the drive, eclectic place,
all sorts of cool little restaurants and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to pick one, bring you
with us briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't be filming a ton in there because
it's kind of awkward and weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll definitely show you the place on
the outside and show you some of the food
[SPEAKER_02]: that we order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll be finding ourselves
another spot to have a nice big session
[SPEAKER_02]: because we got more terms to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are outside walking over to Marcello's,
this cool Italian pizzeria place that has
[SPEAKER_01]: this huge wood fire pizza oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big wood fire pizza oven.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who that was, but she's
waving to us and she's excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she thinks she was on film.
[SPEAKER_02]: She probably did.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't understand I'm holding the
camera backwards, but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Marcello's for some pizza and
some salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it all on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the witness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever go to the Red Burrito?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Red Burrito.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the, I don't know, it's just,
I don't know, there's something about it
[SPEAKER_00]: that I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that it's just too accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too right on the corner here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't trust it almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really liked burritos anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like hard to get to places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the good places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go to wherever they are to learn
how to get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole trip, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like about riding the
motorbike in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be the stripper bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's destination to the restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And places to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're coming up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are here at Marcello's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for two of the ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's room for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys didn't have a reservation or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I film that oven?
[SPEAKER_02]: With my video camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out this incredible oven they
have in this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is a pizza oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really well done on that oven,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go right here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good vibes in Marcello's,
wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Valerie, our waitress.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice big open area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oven is obviously pimped.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get our pizzas going in there once
we order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll make sure I film him making the
pizza a little bit and get it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we're going to check out
these menus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caesar salad in the house with some fresh
focaccia bread, focaccia bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pizza bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did mozzarella and... I tried to dip
Jupey off with one bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was like, I was cooking up your
bread there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought the birdie dip, too,
for dipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just try it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you like it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're two different cheeses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so see you at Chuan's, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys got extra plates,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, freshly back from some
delicious food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to hit some turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe I maybe would have to hit
that lavender stump one last time because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking any home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that's going home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like that one too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I liked it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take it off his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell and the taste literally brings
you that, brought me that nostalgic
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling back of being in one of the first
grows that I learned how to cut clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: see these strains and everything like that
that were just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I almost got it on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw like it was weird, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through some doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a glimpse of a face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these things do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These these terpene profiles trigger
memories that have been long forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also get that feeling of being
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive stuff, this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's a bit of a time traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we dabbing on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you should hit the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the newest one that I just loaded up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've already hit the Jack Frost,
the Lavender and the Clementine and
[SPEAKER_02]: Stardog is the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have another dabber to fill this
one up, so we'll have to find one more
[SPEAKER_02]: clean dabber at one point.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little rip for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our last one is Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how's that for a nice little end
flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Tangy'd up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can bounce those little caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subtle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a citrusy flavory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming in late, but it's cushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some deep tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to hit it right now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That cushy, earthy, dirty, but like good
dirt taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like blank fucking earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I taste now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me when I opened it a little
bit of the Long Valley Kush in the sense
[SPEAKER_02]: of how just utterly deep it is in those
tones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me try a little Stardog with a
little Rosin Rip because why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking good smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good smoking this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost no taste on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my second breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that earthy darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I did an evening for people of
terpenes, it would be important to start
[SPEAKER_02]: off with the subtler ones earlier and hit
with the really powerful dessert ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's why we don't eat the
chocolate lava cake for the entree or for
[SPEAKER_02]: the appetizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to ask the world why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not dessert first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just explained exactly why with
the terpene metaphor, which is that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: blow out your senses with Jack Frost,
Tangy, Clementine, Lavender Skunk,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you go and hit subtle ones,
you're like, fuck, it just wasn't quite as
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I think that it's, I think that we
would have gotten more flavor from them
[SPEAKER_02]: prior to say, although that Stardog is
strong in my mouth right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that rosin we were hitting is SFOG
Hash Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, San Fran OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of a good mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Stardog, but what do you say to
Tangy, my friend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I say let's fucking do her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we Tangy up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love breakfast for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do breakfast for dinner a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't do dinner for breakfast that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe for maybe leftover Chinese
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll heat it up for breakfast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly like a dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually put an egg in it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make it breakfasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always sort of breakfasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love breakfast for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breakfast for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love this bacon gravy my buddy's
mom used to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break bacon gravy and pancakes for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my faves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get this Tangy in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to try this other rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: This MK Ultra Rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 micro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also very nice gold color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very golden color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll dab nicely with a little
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 25 micron bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin pressed into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we were talking earlier about the
cushions and all the different resin size
[SPEAKER_00]: heads and all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were the best and what are the
worst and you know but really there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: best or worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the person and what they
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people I mean like with
anything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people want their steak well done and
some people want their steak medium rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat steak period but I know the
people that do are very pissed off when it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't come the way they want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just say people are particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the Tangy turped up on the MK
Ultra hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little dessert down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you just close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed you did that.
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those ones that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They close my eyes.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was getting at with the different
micron sizes would it be more sativa likes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are the smaller heads that are really
good or is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the generalization has not been as
easy to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that because originally the first
time I saw really small heads was from
[SPEAKER_02]: sativas or narrow leaf drug cultivars
grown outdoors in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under a tropical sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 25 and 45 micron hash were like
the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that's where they got the most
and that's where it was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like the intensity of the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heads were just smaller but they were
still killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see that in sativas that were
grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't say that it's sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that it was some sativas that
were grown in a tropical sun that I you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's basically what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started saying to people I think it's
from like sun-grown sativas and that
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped to it's sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativas have smaller heads and indigas
have larger heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like as the years went
on I was like you know I'm not sure that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really super.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might be generalizing a lot in
that statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe make it and maybe creating the wrong
assumptions that people are like oh I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't even use that bag because you know I
don't do I'm using just these certain
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars and I shouldn't get anything in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like no no no just use all the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time it'll teach you what you're
doing and it'll show you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't be able to know without you know
all the different bags because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: people all the time contact me and say oh
I you know I don't usually get that much
[SPEAKER_02]: in this bag and all of a sudden I started
getting a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like did you change the cultivar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah I was using a different well
that's because they're all different man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you've heard some of the fucking
stupidest questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know you answer them nicely but some
are just probably just like are you
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously fucking asking me that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an amazing rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tangy was super fire though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For how light it smelled in the jar
because when you have a lot of it it
[SPEAKER_02]: smells really strong but just in ten drops
I didn't think it smelled that strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even opened the other jar to smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the taste is I really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpene fiend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going in for the terp dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he goes finishing it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to get dark outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But always a pleasure to come into the
city and rip it up with D420K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lay some bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terp dips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bong ribs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eat some food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out on the drive and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: you you you
