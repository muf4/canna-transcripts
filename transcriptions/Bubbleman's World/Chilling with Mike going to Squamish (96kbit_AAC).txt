[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with my good buddy Mike,
who I've known for over 15 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bubble ambassador, and we're sitting
here at the Shannon Archer Memorial Bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just over to the side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've decided now that I'll just have my
sessions next to the bench, not to offend
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a beautiful day here in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heading up to Squamish on the way up to
Whistler on our motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought we would stop, and I would
tell you a little bit about this Apex
[SPEAKER_00]: electronic cigarette that I recently got
turned on to in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realized the camera angle is pretty
dark, but I wanted to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a little session.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be my first time hitting this unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Bird, who I met in Jamaica,
Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll like Bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really character of a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he gifted me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And said, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hitting one in Jamaica and I was
quite impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this really big strong metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always bangs it to show how strong it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you've got your dome right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the ceramic dish with the
titanium element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit bigger and deeper than
most that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives a real serious rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes with a charger, a little
silicone case for your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A steam version, a vaporizer version for
herb that screws on, and then the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: version as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although any pen will fit on the Apex
battery because it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's 10 mil or what the
size is exactly, but it's the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority, 99% of all the pens out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long does the battery last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's what he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, dude, I bet you I kill it in a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I bet you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch us kill it right now in three hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it brand new with the factory charge or
did you give it a charge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's basically brand new with the
factory charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that for a little fill up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a topper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be sitting on the nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rip that dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to do the honors, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Front button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of sits in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do kind of this or this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of doing this way and had it in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it any way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't turn it at too much of an angle
with the powder for the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once you once you flame on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely globed right out right away
and turned to a nice smoky nice little
[SPEAKER_01]: chamber here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at your vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little 99% dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aftertaste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they call it an electronic cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I think I swear you should call
it something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of some next level shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes with a little tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little dabber tool for getting
your shit in there.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tell the parts are high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The charger in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little smaller than a C.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bigger than your standard vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.7 volt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's got quite a charge,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably go four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real deal for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it complements the whole size of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big enough to house that battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it fits in the hand is quite
nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like this sort of thing right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have an on and off auto kind of
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pack it away, does it like,
you know, a lot of vaporizers have a five
[SPEAKER_01]: button on off?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but he said he's never had the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a heavy button that it doesn't
like feel how heavy that button is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got... True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to that little plastic button
that all you have to do is lean it up
[SPEAKER_00]: against something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spring loaded button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spring loaded button.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool little product, I got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely hats off to the Apex pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be carrying them on fresh headies
here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still carry trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check us out for our variety of vapor
pens that we promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I only use the two, the ones
that work the best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And props to the dry sift too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that an Astro ball?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was an OG Kush Cross,
a fruity OG Kush Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named it for a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to continue our ride here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here on motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue up on the highway
99 towards Squamish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just arrived here in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Chief over in the
distance, that big giant chunk of granite
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the Tim Hortons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Shady Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some really nice food here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go in and have a salmon
burger or something along that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to come with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any little bit helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fun and games until someone
closes the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine would be it's all fun and games until
the D-nail breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fake backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please seat yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kids because it's a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the salmon burger from the
Shady Tree that I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pulled pork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, with onion rings.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob looking up like he's looking up
above the onion rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I are now at I guess we're at
Britannia Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Britannia mines are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever driven home from
Whistler, this is the Sea to Sky Highway,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Ocean on the right, right in front
of a giant mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to film X-Files and such things
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old copper mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids have gone and done the tour with
their school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scooby Doo was shot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sitting next to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we haven't dabbed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the Hitman out, put a little
water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, Mike said, is it OK that it's
salt water?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have to be for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I actually got to get one more piece
of the puzzle, which is a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I should bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaside nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaside nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the nail out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torch to bring our temperatures up to
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperatures do you need for the
nails to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just heat it up orange, and then wait
for a few minutes, and then dab it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or wait for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually just heat up the right side,
which you can get on doing just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of hear that sound to make sure you
know the torch there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great for portability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first torch nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sound right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hitting some full melt dry sift
that I made about a month back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was an OG Kuss cross from a
friend up in Prince George, a friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jay for this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's got to be like 95 degrees right
now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little even more with this torch next to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give that a little bit more of a
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think she's a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's a go, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a real nice rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that quality too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny thing to tell you guys, we climbed a
gnarly fence to get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking it's just, you know, it was
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to climb in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this huge fence right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not supposed to be in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a fence like 30 feet back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't be jumping the fence
unnecessarily this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat up the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite side, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your orange and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attempted to go for a swim.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitman ribs by the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish you guys could see exactly how much
that was bubbling in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost overflowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like magma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, melted up quite nice, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're about 15 to 20 minutes
away from the home station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't be too far for us to get
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highway is quite busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It being Sunday on, I guess, some sort of
holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, yeah, BC day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow's the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's the Sunday long weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of cars coming down from Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of cars coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're gonna go for a dip in this
ocean right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're telling me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right thing to do, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got trunks on the bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that rip-off, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next adventure takes us to Lions
Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: LB.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off to LB.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a swim, we'll share a little
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, see you guys in LB.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you.
We'll see you in LB.
