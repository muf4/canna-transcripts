[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick little short message I wanted
to share with you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one of my employees call me today
and ask me in regards to a video that did
[SPEAKER_00]: some explaining about the endocannabinoid
system, pointing people in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, how they can learn a little
bit about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought as I was driving home from
downtown today on my way up to the bay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stop here where I used to live at
beautiful Sunset Marina right between
[SPEAKER_00]: Horseshoe Bay and Squamish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful waterfront properties here,
about eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought what better place to give
you guys a little bit of a lowdown on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocannabinoid system is basically
a signaling system that allows the body to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate biological function through
homeostasis of the immune system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does this through signals that are
basically run on the fuel that is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabinoids can be produced
endogenously in the body through the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they are considered to be the
building blocks of life because they build
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, endogenous ones inside your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cannabinoids, also known as phyto
cannabinoids, can also be obtained by the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, either orally, vaporization,
smoking of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also regulate biological functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you can know this without really
doing too much deep research is that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis increases appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reddens and puffs up the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the release of ocular
pressure, extremely important to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who is suffering from glaucoma and
potentially going to lose their sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The release of the ocular pressure in an
instant of inhaling cannabinoids can save
[SPEAKER_00]: one's eyesight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty serious thing,
as is the increase of an appetite in
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that's dying of wasting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing an appetite in someone that has
no appetite whatsoever is miraculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why it seems like a miracle when you
give a small child one single drop of this
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and it can eliminate hundreds of
seizures daily down to one seizure a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is is it is a very important part
of our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very important part of how we
regulate and how we stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been deemed illegal for the
last 40 to 50 to 60 to 70 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're learning that, you know,
not just the smoking aspect of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the really important aspect of it has
become the oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're suffering, really, if you want
to prevent disease, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming phyto cannabinoids orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself prefer to do that through a
coconut oil extract, but there is a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of ways that you can learn to
extract the resins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn about decarboxylation,
which it sounds more complex than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply heating up the resin to the
point where the acids of the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, CBN, all of the cannabinoids that are
in acid form, they decarboxylate through
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat and a carboxylic acid ring is
removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is it activates the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It activates THC, it activates CBD,
CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they become activated once heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never had to think about this before
because you were smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when you heat it,
decarboxylation occurs instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're baking or cooking or creating
an oral extract, like a coconut oil
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, we're going to be using
temperatures for certain amounts of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have videos on this very thing if
you want to Google coconut oil hash
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a really nice YouTube video that
shows you how much to use per cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut, how long to leave the crock pot
on for how long, and how long to leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: crock pot on for how long, and all of
those things sort of taken care of in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to check that video,
you feel free to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also urge you to check out my
Facebook group, The Endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: System.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some incredible compilation of
people in there putting stories and clips
[SPEAKER_00]: and videos and all sorts of really
inspirational information on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, on the success
story of people shrinking their cancers,
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating cancers, or at least shutting
cancers off to the point where they're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer detrimental and life-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell people on the regular,
feed your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that if you're dabbing
up a storm, that that's going to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have glaucoma and you're smoking or
vaporizing, you're definitely going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: an immediate relief, an immediate
medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got something more along the
lines of massive tumors, tremors,
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that might require a deeper
saturation of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I've been so impressed
with United Cannabis and with Blue River
[SPEAKER_00]: is their Act Now program, the Activated
Cannabinoid Therapy program, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: sheds light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it creates a landscape
for a person to see a phyto-cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal and preventative aspect
landscape that allows one to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of the subtleties of actually
stacking cannabinoids and not just taking
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant, extracting it, and using that
as your medicine, but extracting many
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, many plants, and then stacking
those into these really beautiful prana
[SPEAKER_00]: products that UCAN is producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hopefully going to be producing
in Jamaica with our Jamaican project here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting to get our clinical
trials going, our animal studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can make sure we know how safe
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, these guys have a way of
doing things that you've got to follow if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to play their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I think it's time to feed my
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some beautiful 7 Star from
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice, nice sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's grape crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hitting it out of the Faberge egg
with the DC glass banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's cooled off enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock carb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock stone was my pillow, is the Bob
Marley lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about rock cab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock stone was my carb cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful taste on that 7 Star that
Horatio's whipped off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The added terpenes really push the flavour
over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me just want to hit one after
another, after another, after another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, I mean, I might as well do,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you guys have any questions on
the endocannabinoid system, this is a real
[SPEAKER_00]: short little video just giving you some
background on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. David Allen, who comes onto Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look for him on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an endocannabinoid specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Malamade, I think is his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also quite a doctor who's also very
involved and knowledgeable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Dr. William Courtney,
who is, of course, the specialist in
[SPEAKER_00]: juicing cannabis and juicing the acid
versions of the resins and really
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining on how medicinal, preventative
those cannabinoids can be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very exciting to have all of these
different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you want to check out a
really great place to get updated on the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular, check us out at Hash Church right
here on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually put up the link two or three
days before Hash Church starts so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the live countdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we go for three, four,
five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about a lot of growing and lights
and hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also talk about the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some pretty valid people with
PhDs and doctorate degrees and really
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low temp Terpsif dabs are just killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Horatio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving the seven star dabs here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting on the Howe Sound in beautiful
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a quick little reference,
this is probably about five kilometres
[SPEAKER_00]: from north of Horseshoe Bay where the
ferries take you to Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right across the way, behind me,
the tallest mountain in the clouds is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to the left of that, you've got
Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the right of that, you have this
little guy named Boyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the huge islands to the right of
that that are multiples are called Gambier
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's all I'm going to share
with you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little endocannabinoid knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please feed yours every day and we'll talk
to you very soon on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
