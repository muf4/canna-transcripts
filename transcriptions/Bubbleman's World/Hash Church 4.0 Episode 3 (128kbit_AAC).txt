[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have just started the stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go over to the old stream and
let them know that we are now live.
[SPEAKER_05]: That should do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now let's let the people in from the
waiting room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thanks everyone for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashturch 4.0, episode three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty darn excited about it actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to give a shout out to Josh and Kelly
for reaching out to me the other day and
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, let's do a Hashturch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got all these incredible people that
want to share their information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everyone for being very
patient and sitting in the room for the
[SPEAKER_05]: last 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alexandra, Rio, La La Gardens,
Dragonfly Earth Medicine, Duke Diamond in
[SPEAKER_05]: the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for your patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I ran a Hashturch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got my little buddy, the Lorax here taking
care of business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all is good and welcome all you
beautiful smiling faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, family.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, family.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so awesome to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Duke, beautiful, beautiful to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially nice to see you, Duke,
because it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, top of the morning to y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really good seeing your smiling
faces too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are always just so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You too, Mr. Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't seen you in a hot minute as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't aged a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm growing my gray beard so it
makes me feel more distinguished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the wise look like you could do
some wizard, wizard stuff or something,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Alexandra, how are you this morning?
[SPEAKER_08]: I love your beautiful background.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: That design?
[SPEAKER_01]: The earth right behind me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a gospel problem that is
connected directly to the creative and
[SPEAKER_01]: healing energy of the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it's appropriate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rio, it's nice to see you in your
greenhouse right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's the weather there and how's it
going?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you've already been starting
planting.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're up here at the farm today.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got our wifi set up and Katie's here.
[SPEAKER_18]: With me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's lovely.
[SPEAKER_18]: The weather's been beautiful, but it was
like 80, there was a 50 degree swing as it
[SPEAKER_18]: goes 35 at night and then 85 in the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he kind of caught us off guard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a cancer moon yesterday
and we were supposed to plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are showing up, Tina.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a, it's a war.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's going to be a windy cold day
compared to yesterday's 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, these swings are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be really nice for everybody to
say where about they're from, because
[SPEAKER_14]: we're all a Dempere panel.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us are farmers from all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Rio, you're in, you're in California.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Lala.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the beautiful Southern Humboldt bio.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my co-conspirator and girlfriend
and expert Katie.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've been, uh, I've been here off and
on since I was seven, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_18]: 10 years on this farm and we're,
we're kind of, we're like at 1800 feet.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a really beautiful Appalachian for
Sativas, which this is Highland,
[SPEAKER_18]: Oaxacan gold.
[SPEAKER_18]: Katie was going to showcase.
[SPEAKER_18]: We love our, you know, unique and fun
strains to grow up here.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, it's a beautiful paradise.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some fun with your African orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe, I believe that was yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was, it was, it was Joey.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also had some shashamani that we,
we had, I feel we had some Africans,
[SPEAKER_08]: shashamani and, uh, one other one from
you, I believe.
[SPEAKER_18]: African lady.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's, that is a shashamani with
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Poison, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_19]: Greo urban poison as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there was another one with shashamani
enters.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: This Highland Oaxacan gold is our favorite
this year though.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: Love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some seeds from Oaxaca or from
Columbia from the sixties that a person
[SPEAKER_08]: gave us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we haven't tried popping in and be cool
for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those like a terminated and ground,
especially in one of your areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about that later, but yeah,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Lala, where are you in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_14]: What area are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sierra Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's maybe frozen or where she might be
frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: My back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado, but basically a cash la puter,
um, river.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, um, the river that feeds this
entire area.
[SPEAKER_14]: And are you guys starting to have some,
um, bulbs and stuff come up or the tree
[SPEAKER_14]: starting to bloom yet?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you still getting some snow?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Aspen's just coming out a little bit
and the leaf tips are starting to show,
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah, things are a little slower this
spring than they were last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a later winter and then even though
we've had fluctuations, it's been a slow
[SPEAKER_11]: spring.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't feel too behind.
Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alexandra, where are you at?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on in your gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in Vancouver Island or on Vancouver
Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, my bulbs are all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a really late spring and
wet, very, very wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes out, it's happy to come out
and then it gets like a smushy moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also have a really cold winter,
a little bit frost here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is absolutely not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like last year, actually,
we had a really cold spring as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really cold winter for our region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'm going to the garden and see
what has died or not coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for me, that's the first thing
I'm going around and see all my babies who
[SPEAKER_01]: comes back, welcome them and not,
it really hurts in the heart, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, what can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes room for something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, then it goes out and it gets
replaced with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, you didn't do well anyway
out of the pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but no, uh, we, we starting to get
more and more green here, but so wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: so much water, so much water.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a blessing when you're from
California, because it's a terrible
[SPEAKER_08]: drought over there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think in, in quality, in quantity,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the good stuff can always be bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Duke, where are you from and what's
going on in your gardens?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that you're planting some
indoor stuff as well as some outdoor.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love to hear what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm, uh, back in Colorado,
um, down southern part of the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: like San Luis Valley area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, weather's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like been warming up and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of sunshine and warmth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, yeah, getting cranking on
the setting up the indoor, literally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got, uh, got the lights going up and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the veg already kind of kicking
clients coming back in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: little by little.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, man, it was really, really happy
and, uh, appreciate y'all so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, uh, you know what them babies going
to be eating on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely some dragon flyers medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the strains that you're
going to be really excited to get back
[SPEAKER_08]: into because everyone's so stoked about
dominion seeds and, and Duke diamond seeds
[SPEAKER_08]: and the skunks and all the stuff that
you've created over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Huge ups to you for keeping it real for
the family and the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just curious to hear your, some of your
thoughts are on the new varietals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, uh, some of the, the, the new
varieties, you know, I am, I keep it like
[SPEAKER_02]: real hush until, you know, it's,
it's that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, you know, uh,
I'm in church and I want to curse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, there's a lot of
scanning people out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so they're looking to rip you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stinky, you know, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll just, I'll just shout you out one
more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were at the Admiral cup and you
had your boots and the inside there,
[SPEAKER_08]: you had definitely some of the most like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridiculous smelling weed at the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was amazing, you know, smelling it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone has good ganja.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the stuff you had was insane,
but it is, it is true to know that when
[SPEAKER_14]: you're at the Emerald cup and then there's
one person's pocket that stands out
[SPEAKER_14]: amongst everybody else's, it really was
Duke.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got to say, he was the one I could
smell out of everybody at the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Duke, I'm just, we've been running your
varietals now ever since then.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, we've been doing some crosses and
some really great stuff with your stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we cannot wait to get it back to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are first on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some of this, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, organic, slow dragonfly
inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when y'all come at you,
like you grew this with our dry to fly
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh yeah, that's all they eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have some special fermentation
concoctions that we know about over the
[SPEAKER_08]: years too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's definitely a love for the plant
and an energy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So any of y'all out there who know this
man, he's just one of the kindest souls
[SPEAKER_14]: and totally dedicated to the plant as so
many of us are here.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we're growing the fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I definitely could say that about Rio
Rio when I came from everybody that Shaw
[SPEAKER_14]: Shimani, when we came out to your farm and
we did that late night, uh, you guys were
[SPEAKER_14]: trimming and all of the smells of those
incredible long flowering sativas.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just like, I remember that night weeds
still growing in January.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that never happens and head up
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble man, what's happening on your land.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you grew a lot of flowers and stuff
last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get you some flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were lame last year, but anyway,
what's happening for you this year?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we just had 75 centimeters of snow
fall on Whistler mountain about four or
[SPEAKER_06]: five days ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, am I frozen?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: 75 centimeters fell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, uh, um, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of water coming down the
mountain right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: All my bulbs are up for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an acre here in lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have, uh, we have a pretty
incredible garden with all sorts of
[SPEAKER_06]: different wild flowers and edibles and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, excited to, uh, see how the
season goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure if I'm frozen again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Northern Michigan Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's basically lots of lakes,
lots of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all glacial tilth and, uh,
they're called kettle holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically, um, you know,
the glaciers receding and scratching the
[SPEAKER_07]: earth, leaving behind, uh, a bunch of
lower areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, I'm, uh, again, on the same
boat with the, the melting and the ton of
[SPEAKER_07]: water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but the, it seems like a lot of my
mountains are kind of drying out faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sun's hitting them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The water's kind of pouring aside and
there's some action right at like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the tip of those points.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so it's going pretty well over here.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been seeing some pictures and I know
you're getting a lot of seeds in and
[SPEAKER_14]: everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you got any, uh, favorite varieties
that you're putting in?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about, I'm running some stuff
from Terp Wizard, who's another Michigan,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, uh, organic farmer and, uh,
regen family, I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'm running a couple of his
varietals, uh, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that I've saved from California
from, you know, the Swami days and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything like that from hanging with
Swami and all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, but mostly I'm kind of open
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really thought about popping too
much stuff because I'm a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, you know, probably a month out.
[SPEAKER_07]: From that kind of timeframe, but,
uh, but yeah, it's starting to come down
[SPEAKER_07]: the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you traditionally do, I say
traditional, but like all you like to do
[SPEAKER_08]: on your land, uh, start them a little
later and, and have like a smaller depth
[SPEAKER_08]: in the back sack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to do that again this year?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I tried to dry farm, so I don't
irrigate my stuff up there at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all rainwater.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I set up my hoop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I plant small plants a little bit later,
um, into who go home.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dig a hole and then bury a bunch of
carbon and plant inside there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and that seems to hold enough water to
keep the plants happy throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're small, easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't end up covering them until
super late into the season, mostly just to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep the rain off of like the finishing
nugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, uh, but this year I might try to
do a little bit different supplement with
[SPEAKER_07]: extra water, uh, to try to get slightly
larger plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice when it's always, I seems like the
whole state of Michigan could be a dry
[SPEAKER_08]: farm state because the whole, there's so
much water all around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, easily for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, you know, it's just,
it's one of those things where it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: as soon as you kind of find out about it,
um, you know, this was, or three seasons
[SPEAKER_07]: ago was my first season kind of doing
cougle cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's remarkable how well that
works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here specifically in catching all of that
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I would walk up to my hoop
houses past the orchard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's raging.
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned the corner thinking that they'd
like, you know, some water and they just
[SPEAKER_07]: never really asked for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell a story later because we're
going to introduce people about that,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's pretty amazing what,
what water retention and can happen in the
[SPEAKER_08]: hugels give thanks to noble and tomorrow
and the family and the children.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So y'all tell us where you're from and
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your appellation?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're in Lake County, um,
in California and down here it's really
[SPEAKER_10]: hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we are each like the last three years
I've started noticing it's just gotten
[SPEAKER_10]: hotter and hotter where I've started
having to grow like in desert conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because it just gets so hot in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, this last year I planted a month,
like two behind when I was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: usually on my target goal, whereas like by
the end of May, all my veggies and all my
[SPEAKER_10]: medicinals are in and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was too late.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so hot this past year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just kind of having to speed up a
lot of our planting and, um, learning how
to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like really going underneath trees and any
kind of shape that we can do and creating
[SPEAKER_10]: more natural shade.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of like our appellation
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're excited to work with like,
um, a lot more sativas as well,
[SPEAKER_10]: because we know we can do those long-term
those, you know, long flowering plants out
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I've had them go until I think
the longest when I have mid January and I
[SPEAKER_10]: finally cut it, but it was more rainy and
that's that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we don't have some of those rains.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, okay, how do we adjust?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we can, yeah, we're going to
try some more long-term ones this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, but yeah, that's our,
that's our appellation.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just arriving here from Laytonville is
a lot of you guys know, um, we're,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, shutting down our farm up there in
Laytonville, unfortunately due to,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, just market.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, we're regrouping, regrouping us
too, because we've, I've been in licensing
[SPEAKER_10]: and trying to do this since 2016 when it
like first all like came about and I was
[SPEAKER_10]: in talks with our County.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this last year, I kind of had this
like meltdown because I was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got DSD from thinking about permits
and licensing and like, I just can't do it
[SPEAKER_10]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We even were going to do the hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: This year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were just all decided, you know
what, let's just take a year and breathe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're building the medicinal garden
and we're doing commercial herbs,
[SPEAKER_10]: which we need for the products for healed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I self gardens and we're excited.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's, uh, she's, you know, loves her
coffee.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's, you know, the most intensive
barista, you know, it's like hard to take
[SPEAKER_19]: her to coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause she's like, you know, but she's
amazing, you know, about like the detail
[SPEAKER_19]: of like quality and making sure the beans
were sourced properly and, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: they're roasted properly and all those
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_19]: So she had the idea of starting up a
coffee cart and we're going to do some
[SPEAKER_19]: trips down central South America and go
and talk to some of these different farms
[SPEAKER_19]: and do some sourcing and really trying to
help out some of these, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: more regenerative coffee farmers and help
push them in that direction.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe even do some consulting and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can be able to bring back beans and
start roasting here and start setting up a
[SPEAKER_19]: mobile.
[SPEAKER_19]: Coffee truck, a big 20 foot trailer with a
big deck on it and all kinds of reading
[SPEAKER_19]: material and regenerative phone push the
message of how important sourcing,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you know, products from the right
people is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, yeah, that's a, that's a whole new
mission.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that she's going to thrive at and,
you know, so I've been helping her out and
[SPEAKER_19]: we're getting that going.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a buddy building a beautiful
trailer right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, I feel like we can integrate that
with like the events and really,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, plant that seed about true
organic.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I'm not just organic,
but true organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and true regenerative dials,
which, you know, it's his brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just had newly have a
regenerative, uh, pure, pure farmer in
[SPEAKER_08]: Argentina, uh, Rodrigo and all the links
to all the farmers are on DEM,
[SPEAKER_08]: pure farms.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do keep that part, uh, up to date,
but, uh, Rodrigo is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just, I just wanted to say,
yeah, I just wanted to say that here we
[SPEAKER_14]: are, you know, cannabis farmers,
we've been playing these games.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been playing a lot of papers.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been pushing a tremendous amount of
licensing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been pushing a tremendous amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there was a time when legacy
farmers in California, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington, BC, Colorado were,
were able to feed their families were able
[SPEAKER_14]: to keep homestead.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're able to put in crops every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now through legalization, basically
it's, it's the idea of legalization is to
[SPEAKER_14]: take out those legacy farmers right in
front of our face.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, and I don't, I don't want to,
you know, sugar coated or anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to make it sound like,
Oh, well, you know, we've got some place
[SPEAKER_14]: here and up here in Canada, a lot of the
micro growers, I know Shay is going to be
[SPEAKER_14]: talking here.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's on Rosebud farm, talk about pushing
papers and everything that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: do for legalization up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what we're really starting to realize
is that when things become legalized with
[SPEAKER_14]: the federal government, when things become
legalized with a province or a state,
[SPEAKER_14]: that means that it's more up for big
corporate man and the big corporate entity
[SPEAKER_14]: to take over.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the reason why Dempure is Dempure is
because we're here to support each other.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all on the same page with
regenerative community, regenerative
[SPEAKER_14]: values, regenerative, you know,
growing practices.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and here's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_14]: It heal thyself and Noble and Tamara.
[SPEAKER_14]: Noble wasn't able to maybe keep his farm
and a lot of other people aren't,
[SPEAKER_14]: but we have this beautiful connection of
these people, real people, real people in
[SPEAKER_14]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not just marketing gimmicks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're the actual blood behind,
you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of you all who are listening out
here on YouTube, you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_14]: faces of some legacy growers who have been
in this business for, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 plus years and counting.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of us have been bringing you all.
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're reaching out to you all and
consumers out there is to make sure to be
[SPEAKER_14]: supporting these farms and these legacy
farms and Dempure and people that are
[SPEAKER_14]: getting out there and trying to join
together to continue the legacy farm
[SPEAKER_14]: quality, which is the quality is not just
in the flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: The quality is in the community.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the quality is in the education.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the quality is in the kindness
that we have and in the reverence that we
[SPEAKER_14]: have to this plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Craig, you've been through so much having
to do with all this too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear from Craig.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe talk about your beautiful partner,
Melanie and the work that she's been
[SPEAKER_08]: doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, we love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alpin Glow Farms.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning to everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Marcus, for opening up your
house and sharing the space with us.
[SPEAKER_12]: We sure appreciate you and everything
you've done to support us through the
[SPEAKER_12]: process.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as to where we are, if you look
between Rio and Katie through that
[SPEAKER_12]: rectangle tall window, that is precisely
where Katie is pointing where my farm is.
[SPEAKER_12]: That mountain is called Reed Mountain and
it is historic known locally as Weed
[SPEAKER_12]: Mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was it's one of the taller peaks right
outside of Garberville.
[SPEAKER_12]: And has, you know, every single one of
those ridge lines has legacy historic
[SPEAKER_12]: grows that have been up there for,
you know, 30, 40, maybe even some 50
[SPEAKER_12]: years.
[SPEAKER_12]: You walk those ridge lines, you're going
to find some water line.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to see some boards nailed to
trees where pots were grown in the trees
[SPEAKER_12]: like it's it's pretty much ground zero,
southern humble.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got, you know, Salmon Creek,
Reed Mountain and some of these other
[SPEAKER_12]: little micro communities.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're about 11 miles as a crow flies
from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are at the confluence of two
rivers, the South Fork of the Eel and the
[SPEAKER_12]: East Branch of the South Fork.
[SPEAKER_12]: The confluence is right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we get this really nice air exchange at
least twice a day where the valleys will
[SPEAKER_12]: pull in the ocean fog.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we kind of get this Oreo cookie effect
where we're the cream in the middle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because sometimes, you know, if you're if
you've been around mountains at all,
[SPEAKER_12]: they get a little cloud on the peak,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We get a lot of beautiful sunrises and
Rio's farm gets the beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a nice little balance in our
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah, we've been facing a lot of
challenges with legalization and the
[SPEAKER_12]: county and over taxation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where my partner, Melanie,
has been such a rock and such a voice.
[SPEAKER_12]: She actually has a master's in
communication and has been delivering
[SPEAKER_12]: these amazing three minute comments to the
board of supervisors and just taking her
[SPEAKER_12]: public speaking to really support the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of our last rallies in front of
the courthouse, she delivered a very
[SPEAKER_12]: moving speech and we were able to take our
taxation from.
[SPEAKER_12]: Down 85 percent.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we pay 15 percent of the tax we did
last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for a farm of 10,000 square feet like
ours, that one from 10,000.
[SPEAKER_12]: To legitimize our lives in in the in the
greater world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We we knew who we were and we were
legitimately conducting good business and
[SPEAKER_12]: parts of our community and paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But but now with legalization,
when it first happened, at least locally,
[SPEAKER_12]: we were excited to pay for our roads and
pay for our schools through that system.
[SPEAKER_12]: We always did it on a volunteer basis and
we gave more than our share and built
[SPEAKER_12]: schools and built hospitals and did all
these.
[SPEAKER_12]: Federal like it was just phenomenal,
like an overs overbearing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the way California built out their
supply chain, they built it such a
[SPEAKER_12]: fractured line so no one could really
participate in all features.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that fractured supply chain is really
part of the demise of the entire
[SPEAKER_12]: California system.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need a you need a permit, a separate
permit to do anything for me to drive a
[SPEAKER_12]: plant off my property, to move a plant
from my light debt to my full term.
[SPEAKER_12]: That takes another license.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working hard to push on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Melanie's been a big help with all that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And our entire community is is really
working forward to to with all that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate everyone here today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, everyone has a unique skill
and a unique strength.
[SPEAKER_12]: And together, we're really able to pull
something together that can support each
[SPEAKER_12]: other.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome, Craig.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know, I think that inevitably
we're going to get into the conversation
[SPEAKER_14]: today on, you know, how we can support
each other.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of countries now are starting to
come into legalization.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to be dealing with a lot of
this licensing.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to be looking at exactly
what we've been dealing with.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're going to see the straight up
takeover of legacy farmers, of legacy
[SPEAKER_14]: growers as well breeders.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like we can really be offering
them education forward on how we can join
[SPEAKER_14]: together.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that really doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to a cannabis summit in
Kelowna next weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's next weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be a real policy type
summit where we're going to be creating
[SPEAKER_08]: new laws and new verbiage for maybe
creating a new license and just working on
[SPEAKER_08]: the federal licensing up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say Kelowna, which is in
British Columbia, for those of you who
[SPEAKER_08]: don't know, is a big cannabis summit we're
going to be speaking at and involved in,
[SPEAKER_08]: along with First Nations groups from
British Columbia and Canada, which they
[SPEAKER_08]: have the ability to form their own laws,
which I think is really powerful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so do they.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of education.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these panels are part of that
education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's talking about what they're
working on in their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big love to Martin and Ireland.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's people in Ireland all over Europe
having a lot of hard times right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want big people up and make them
feel like they're on the right path and
[SPEAKER_08]: help people know that there's people
behind you that support you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that really leads us on to Shay,
your fight and the good fight.
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year's crop was totally unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rosebud Farms just becoming Dempere
certified.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're so excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love to hear where you're at and your
Appalachia and a little bit about what's
[SPEAKER_14]: going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to say also, please mention
something about the Unicorn Cup,
[SPEAKER_08]: because we're all super, super stoked
about the Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, mark it on your calendars,
the Unicorn Cup's the bomb.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is most beautiful property ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Shay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shay's our newest Dempere farmer in
Britain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the largest crop in British Columbia
and our area of the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for that nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much love for everybody on this panel.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the invite and the
opportunity to learn from a lot of you
[SPEAKER_15]: guys over the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's pretty cool to be sitting here
next to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're regenerative cannabis producers near
Nelson, not too far from Argento,
[SPEAKER_15]: where you guys are.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're LP or a standard.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're probably the smallest standard is
really.
[SPEAKER_15]: But here with a really small canopy for
micro 200m, it's extremely hard to be
[SPEAKER_15]: profitable at those numbers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we felt we had not much choice but to
go LP or standard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rosebud Lake, as you mentioned,
that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in this magical, beautiful
ecosystem, sort of a wildlife reserve on
[SPEAKER_15]: one side and crown land surrounding.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a real wildlife corridor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything from loons and eagles and
wolves.
[SPEAKER_15]: And all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's really balanced, really diversity,
healthy ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what a great place to do regenerative
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if synthetic cooperation moved in
here, it would really have a negative
[SPEAKER_04]: impact.
[SPEAKER_15]: More than weed and community mixed with
music and celebration, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: like up in the level of awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_15]: So August 13th to 14th, 12 to 15th.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, those are the main days.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a whole bunch of really cool
artists coming.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some pretty big headliners that I can't
quite tell you about yet, but I'm really
[SPEAKER_15]: excited for you to to hear about them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do a mix of electronic music, but not just
that we have like acoustic and vocals and
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're really expanding this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: 500 people expected the judges.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do a comparison.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is not a clear permit yet for a
straightforward cannabis cup in Canada
[SPEAKER_15]: yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we do is an educational event.
[SPEAKER_15]: And part of that educational event is a
cannabis comparison where we'll rate
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis and have people in the know like
Kevin Jodhuri and Josh and Kelly educate
[SPEAKER_15]: the consumers on what makes good cannabis,
good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just have a great time,
a great party, awesome camp and all on the
[SPEAKER_15]: lake.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really, really epic thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope to I hope to see everybody there
that can make it across the border.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're local, we hope to get you
there.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're just in such a raw mountainous
area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, it's the beauty of just
developing a new space and creating what
[SPEAKER_08]: we want to see or what the land is working
with is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love the wildness of it to where you
don't have people breathing down your
[SPEAKER_08]: neck.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can really express yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And take a morning dip in the pond,
that lake there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a pond, it's a lake.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is just so amazing to be able to go
to a festival and have a beautiful lake
[SPEAKER_14]: that you can just dive into.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're really going to be working on a
whole zone at Unicorn Cup that's going to
[SPEAKER_14]: be a regenerative Dempure camping area
zone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to be having just campfire
sessions going and education from Dempure
[SPEAKER_14]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much, you know, morning break for
[SPEAKER_14]: us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was sort of the last time that we
had been social with people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been holding it close to our
hearts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And lots of demonstrations, everything
from wild crafting to building,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, forest gardens to washing ash to
freeze drying to tinctures to topicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you want to survive in the wild?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you want to survive?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a self reliant cannabis plant
medicine festival.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to create an open atmosphere
in one of the most oppressive cities on
[SPEAKER_08]: earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We live in one of the most oppressive
societies on earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're free because we live in the
mountains and we live on the land.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the message.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consider moving out to the country,
living on the land.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or working on a community garden in the
city or a lot in your suburb or an area
[SPEAKER_08]: where you can connect to the earth,
because that's where you're going to have
[SPEAKER_08]: some some buffer from the madness.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also your point of health.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if all you can do is work and you can't
do that and you're really caught up in the
[SPEAKER_14]: system and you're on a whole nother path,
you can go and spend all of your money at
[SPEAKER_14]: the farmers markets where all of those
people are doing regenerative stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So then that is you supporting it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So whether you are planting your own
regenerative garden or you're supporting
[SPEAKER_14]: other regenerative farmers, you're still
part of the regenerative movement.
[SPEAKER_14]: It starts from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_14]: So and I guess, you know, here we are,
Tara Lee, here you, you know, be great.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been starting your backyard garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been talking to you a little bit and
love to know your Appalachia and sort of
[SPEAKER_14]: what kind of things have been going on,
you know, in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in your zone and area, what are you
going to put in this year?
[SPEAKER_20]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, Josh Kelly.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for the invite today.
[SPEAKER_20]: Hashtag Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_20]: My Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_20]: I am in Washington State, Grand County
area right in the center of the state.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are in like a dry highland desert
area.
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it wasn't for like the Grand Coulee
Dam and all that, this whole area would be
[SPEAKER_20]: like serious drought.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like we wouldn't have the ag and the
development that we have here.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're lucky for the irrigation that we
have.
[SPEAKER_20]: But the hugelkultur thing and being able
to seek and doing all of that stuff and be
[SPEAKER_20]: able to save the water and all that.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's going to be an amazing
thing to be able to add to this
[SPEAKER_20]: Appalachian area, I would say.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm super nervous today.
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to dab.
[SPEAKER_20]: My gosh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just say, can I just publicly
announce my love for Tara Lee right here?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Lala.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone who doesn't know about Tara Lee,
she is a people's person.
[SPEAKER_08]: She has an amazing YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she
[SPEAKER_08]: lives every day in that spirit of being
thankful for life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And also been really talking up community
gardens with community, making it really
[SPEAKER_14]: easy for people to tackle a yard that only
has grass on it, even if it's a 10 by 10,
[SPEAKER_14]: a two by two, even if it's just a pot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So she's in it every day trying to really
educate people the ways on really easy
[SPEAKER_14]: gardening so that when they pick that
tomato and it may be the one and only
[SPEAKER_14]: tomato that they grew in their backyard,
it may be the highlight day of their
[SPEAKER_14]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what this education from
Dempere farmers also to be a Dempere
[SPEAKER_14]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the agreements that we agree upon
is not only to live our moral costs in our
[SPEAKER_14]: regenerative practices on our own,
but that we're continuously educating
[SPEAKER_14]: people even like I can do, even when you
have been not able to be a voice,
[SPEAKER_14]: your voice has been carrying on to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been an incredible voice of yours
that has been lasting in education and
[SPEAKER_14]: people having pure respect for the plant,
your name coming up so many times because
[SPEAKER_14]: of that resonant love and that resonant
education that you give so freely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Alexandra, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You and Terry have been bringing an
incredible spirituality to this plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and it brings education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your page is incredibly informative too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the way that you share your
gardening story along with everyone and
[SPEAKER_08]: your approach to it I feel is what I'm
really attracted to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we just wanted to roll into
just some really amazing regenerative
[SPEAKER_14]: tips, whether it be community tips,
whether it be gardening tips, anything
[SPEAKER_14]: that you all have been doing that have
been really making waves.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rio and Katie, I'd love to hear from y
'all.
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's just roll this out now that
we've introduced everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just love to hear what's really
working for everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anybody who's on chat who wants to ask
some questions, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we start?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll start.
[SPEAKER_18]: This, with the market collapse,
I just had this epiphany moment that I was
[SPEAKER_18]: just done.
[SPEAKER_18]: And for me, it's like keeping up with the
Joneses.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was always like one foot in one camp,
like trying to keep the farm alive and one
[SPEAKER_18]: foot in the region.
[SPEAKER_18]: Ideas of just the whole intention of this
land was to build a permaculture oasis and
[SPEAKER_18]: use cannabis to fund it.
[SPEAKER_18]: When that funding just got harder and
harder, I was like, I give up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had this moment that just after
harvest, it was kind of a shitty harvest
[SPEAKER_18]: last year.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, all right, I'm just doing
what I most care about.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Katie came on board and we had a plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Mario, can you give me your
microphone, Mario?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also Daniel and Mario, we'll get to
you right after Rio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this winter, I spent the whole winter
working and we had a plan.
[SPEAKER_18]: We developed a plan together and she's
really into plants, which she has the deep
[SPEAKER_18]: knowledge of plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that was an asset for me because
I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we landscaped and came up with some
plans for a new market garden.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we filled in a pond that was never
very useful.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so now we have a big flat with market
beds and a whole hillside that starts with
[SPEAKER_21]: food and fruit and nuts and berries.
[SPEAKER_18]: All who goes with an old windstorm blew
over a live oak.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that one tree built like a hundred by
hundred square foot area.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're just making it super spongy and
absorbent.
[SPEAKER_21]: So anything that flows down just catches.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we have a big cannabis patch under
there where we get to do a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_21]: sativas and things.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a great spot.
[SPEAKER_18]: The cover crop is really abundant and she,
we developed a nut and a berry,
[SPEAKER_18]: like a hedgerow with service berries.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Lizzie, Richard's girlfriend is
becoming the elderberry queen of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Craig just came over and got some
yesterday and we're doing elderberries as
[SPEAKER_18]: an alternative crop.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everyone's committed to the right
thing right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've been mixing our own soil for the
nursery mix.
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead of bringing in bags this year,
we borrowed a cement mixer from Craig and
[SPEAKER_21]: have just making a black moscutes recipe
for soil and using a soil blocker.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we don't have to use plastic
containers.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're just soil blocking everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: And getting in the jadam and ferments.
[SPEAKER_18]: Katie's got IMO three now.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're about to get the IMO four going and
inoculations.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know our soil lacking in a little bit of
fungal bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the cover crop looks good.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we're bringing in the compost and
building the- And spin chataki logs from
[SPEAKER_21]: our friend Mike, who's a mushroom
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so he's just got, you know,
bringing the dump trailer.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's so beautiful compost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give thanks to mushroom Mike, as always.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just keeps providing for so many people
and any of you all out there who are
[SPEAKER_14]: listening, getting a hold of anybody
organic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you're a mushroom cultivator
in your zone or area, because mushroom
[SPEAKER_14]: blocks are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So mushroom blocks are great for soil
building.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only public surface announcement on
the mushroom blocks is, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure that the substrate was organic
when it started.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause mushrooms are smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to, you know,
they, yeah, they have the power to
[SPEAKER_08]: transform, but really do you want to
support like non-organic substrate?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it always encourage, you know,
your mushroom farmer to start with organic
[SPEAKER_08]: glyphosate is not just used in the
agriculture industry or the cut flower
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the forests and they're killing
berries, like service berries,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I like to call Sarvis berries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause my life is Sarvis, but does the,
or the Saskatoon berry, if you're in
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada, super food, but anyway,
it's the huckleberries, all of these
[SPEAKER_08]: berries.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's supposedly get in the way of tree
growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have, you know, this thing like
everyone's, you know, anyway, there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot to that, but so big love to you guys
on, on diversifying.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been doing a soil blockers too,
but I've been just digging up the soil out
[SPEAKER_08]: of my garden and mixing a little compost
in it and just using garden soil for the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil blockers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause really I want the seed to wake up
and know my garden right away,
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than some foreign, you know,
like made soil type thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just our thought process on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're just like seed wakes up,
radical root comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_14]: Aren't doing regenerative.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're indoor, they're under lights or
something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it might not have that type of
intelligence and truly our microbiology
[SPEAKER_14]: just eats it alive.
[SPEAKER_14]: It never really gets the opportunity to
sprout.
[SPEAKER_14]: So another reason why you want to be
getting seeds from breeder is like a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: of these people that you see on here
because we're growing it regeneratively to
[SPEAKER_14]: have that gusto.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lala, what kind of things?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, oh, wait, we're going to move down
here just super quick because Daniel came
[SPEAKER_14]: on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And best friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And best friend farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Mario is still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Mario.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: But Daniel, it's nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heart rock mountain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the weather like?
[SPEAKER_08]: How are your baby?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your baby?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your children?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful children.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn my phone off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Might have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm in Eastern Potter Valley in the
middle mountain Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost the Lake County.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in Potter Valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even in our little region here,
we're in a little banana belt at like
[SPEAKER_09]: seven between twenty three and twenty five
hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go down five hundred feet and it's
it's colder.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go up five hundred feet is colder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's you know, my dad settled there
kind of the end of the road and it turned
[SPEAKER_09]: out to be like a nice little microclimate
climate for growing breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we also can get stuff to go in a
hoop in January.
[SPEAKER_09]: I harvest like my last seed run.
[SPEAKER_09]: I start auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the fall and harvest them in like the
middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And occasionally I have to run like a
couple of nights of heat when it gets down
[SPEAKER_09]: to like 20 for a couple of nights.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's it's rare where we're at.
[SPEAKER_09]: The babies are doing good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, I'm definitely sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not drinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have three small children,
you know, because the brain, it it
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely doesn't work like I want it to
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I lose a lot of things there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, what and this is yeah,
glyphosate fuck, you know, it's like the
[SPEAKER_09]: the DDT of our generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see it around the valley all the time
and some of these farmers and.
[SPEAKER_09]: To change their their their ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: She told me to mind my own business and I
said, I am minding my own business.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're spraying poison where my children
play.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she stopped, you know, and it's like
these things like these people who do it
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't they wouldn't like to be put in a
small little drop of poison into water or
[SPEAKER_09]: their kids food, but they will put it onto
their farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's wild that disconnect there,
you know, that it's just it's just a
[SPEAKER_09]: matter of time, you know, before it's not
being used.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say it almost seems like it's
getting like more common if you if that
[SPEAKER_08]: sounds like even possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they just did this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe maybe because it's like a
household kind of stopped doing it because
[SPEAKER_09]: it's banned.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's got to go somewhere else,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to do with all these war
chemicals?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's tell them to farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's put it in the food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It has come up a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_14]: We really encourage anyone listening out
there to find out where glyphosate is
[SPEAKER_14]: being sprayed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Know that when the roads spring the sides
of the roads or train tracks near you,
[SPEAKER_14]: glyphosate is being sprayed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really get educated on glyphosate because
the real problems with glyphosate is not
[SPEAKER_14]: necessarily in your soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's huge because soil is the very
beginnings of life and it holds the very
[SPEAKER_14]: valuable microbiology, which holds
valuable life forms for plants to be able
[SPEAKER_14]: to grow, but also for our own microbiome
to be able to be healthy and our genome
[SPEAKER_14]: and these type of chemicals actually
attack our DNA along with our
[SPEAKER_14]: microbiology, which changes the day that
our health and wellbeing is defined well,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, now and into the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would recommend glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not including Tacamba and all
the other defoliants.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's thousands of things, but
glyphosate is the easiest one to talk
[SPEAKER_08]: about, but there's many of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our recommendation is when building
indoor gardens, either ask the company
[SPEAKER_08]: that you're getting those leafy products
from, or test it yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going to be the way that you
know that your intelligent, dynamic,
[SPEAKER_08]: accumulating, sentient being ganja isn't
sucking up that stuff into its body and
[SPEAKER_08]: into the classic, the head of the
trichome, which is what we are looking
[SPEAKER_08]: for.
[SPEAKER_08]: In some cases we want the roots and the
seeds and everything, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_08]: big love and best friend Farms,
Brian out in Maine, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting to introduce yourself and
then we're going to find out more tech
[SPEAKER_08]: from the fam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And your Appalachia, where are you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm up in the foothills.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in the foothills of Maine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm at about 600 feet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nestled between the Atlantic and the White
Mountains, I guess.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, so plenty full water.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's 14, like 14 or 15 lakes
and ponds in this town.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's kind of, you know, a lot of hills
among water.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, we're just starting to open up
with the snows all gone and we get really
[SPEAKER_16]: good sun here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I get great exposure.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more of a South East.
[SPEAKER_16]: East sweep, I think, which is really good
for Maine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I bring up too, because of the frost
potential in the late season and the dew.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you get an earlier burn off and
exposure to the sunrise, Southeast side of
[SPEAKER_16]: the hill kind of thing here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's where I sit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're making really incredible hash,
you know, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what are some of the,
maybe some of the new varietals you're
[SPEAKER_08]: excited for this year?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, actually we're making hash all the
time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just like, I've been constantly
breeding to try to find the best hash
[SPEAKER_16]: making plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're focused on traditional form,
but we're getting some pretty greasy,
[SPEAKER_16]: good air dried traditional stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, kind of following in the
ways of Frenchy with the same form and
[SPEAKER_16]: enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, yeah, I've been doing a ton of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just went back to my gas mask clone mom
with a bunch of more like fruit forward
[SPEAKER_16]: gas back stuff here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So some cherry cam and some pineapple
fields for additions to the gas mask.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I actually cracked some dominion
seeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: I seeded them.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I got a friend gifted me some
dominion G and some local skunk.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the local skunk went in first.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I'm stoked about those.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got some AK bean brains gear going
to the same friend gifted me some nice
[SPEAKER_16]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I got some super skunk over there
from, you know, and crossed with a black
[SPEAKER_16]: Domina.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really excited about I got some cough
BX one with same with Dave Pope's help,
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe right in with relic,
I believe is behind it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've got some cough, which I've been
really, really hoping to get back into
[SPEAKER_16]: classic stuff and kind of going forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: With some really cool genetic stuff this
year, I've even been talking to Colin from
[SPEAKER_16]: Vessel Life and we're planning some
interesting project breeding projects here
[SPEAKER_16]: on the farm, which will tie in some more,
I guess, land race types, even some
[SPEAKER_16]: Moroccan and some Nepalese have been
brought up to bring back into some lines
[SPEAKER_16]: here in theory that are producing really
good hash and go in with some more land
[SPEAKER_16]: race hash oriented genetics to see what it
kind of mixes up and yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just candy to the ears just hearing
about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Craig, you can tell us about your
hash here in a sec, but because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: really interesting what you've got going
on with some of your your disconnections.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also wanted to touch on some
regenerative things that we can talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people are dealing with toxic
environments and how can we help people in
[SPEAKER_14]: uptaking some of that toxic material?
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's going to that's people are
asking those questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microbiology eats toxicity, so just cover
across microbiology, more of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maria, what's happening in your in your
neck of the woods?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us something about your Appalachia,
your farm and some of your.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey guys, nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy spring.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, everything's kind of going well here
for some sheep.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a herd of sheep coming in soon and a
couple of weeks and so I'm building a
[SPEAKER_17]: little manger.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a new flock of ducks that I just
reared up and today's their first day free
[SPEAKER_17]: ranging.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: It feels really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were ready to get out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got some muscovies.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys don't know about those,
they're awesome and I kind of like read
[SPEAKER_17]: about him and.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thought that they would be awesome,
but now that I'm like actually holding one
[SPEAKER_17]: compared to like other domestic duck
breeds, their structure is so much
[SPEAKER_17]: stronger like their bone structure and
muscular and their nails are sharper.
[SPEAKER_17]: They fly.
[SPEAKER_17]: They forage better.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like the ultimate homestead duck.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so stoked on those.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel like all the ducks here are
going to be muscovies eventually.
[SPEAKER_17]: Are those the running ducks?
[SPEAKER_17]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those the running ducks that like
don't need the water as much or?
[SPEAKER_17]: No ducks.
[SPEAKER_17]: There are totally different type of duck.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, it's kind of like a horse and a
donkey.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if it if a horse and a donkey have
have a baby, it's a mule, but it's
[SPEAKER_17]: infertile.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if a muscovy and a regular duck have
babies, they're infertile too.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not compatible that way.
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyway, you either got the muscovies or
you got the other ones.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm all about the muscovies right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the farms at 1300 feet.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here in Willets right in the middle of
Mendocino, about 45 minutes from the coast
[SPEAKER_17]: in the foothills.
[SPEAKER_17]: Flatland in the valley.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got a really nice exposure and great
water.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been on this site for eight years now
and from the moment I got here,
[SPEAKER_17]: I kind of like did a permaculture design
of like a livestock laneway around the
[SPEAKER_17]: whole place and then planted accordingly
to feed livestock as they pass through and
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't had livestock until except for
like ducks until this season with the
[SPEAKER_17]: sheep coming in.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a huge transition happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm thinking just as much about that kind
of stuff as I am of the herb because it's
[SPEAKER_17]: really about like being able to like
sustain like a certain lifestyle and live
[SPEAKER_17]: in this place that we love to live and pay
the bills.
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now the herb isn't really paying
the bills.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm like staying as fluid and flexible
as possible, you know, diversifying and
[SPEAKER_17]: one of the things that I'm really focused
on is building alternate income streams
[SPEAKER_17]: with existing infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like how many like returns can I get from
that two inch line that's running through
[SPEAKER_17]: my field or, you know, what kind of
resources do I have on the land that I can
[SPEAKER_17]: like kind of like do as little as possible
to get return from, you know, and keep it
[SPEAKER_17]: all like fertile and abundant and keep the
fertility on site as much as possible,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm giving a lot of thought to that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions or anything?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like to second that emotion and say
many DEM peer farmers are realizing and
[SPEAKER_08]: part of the DEM peer certification is
other crops.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole entire thing is to be that you
don't buy products and that you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: polyculture and that polyculture is not
just with plants, it's with people and
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so lots of farmers are diversifying,
Jaw Gardens moved, they had to move and
[SPEAKER_08]: now he's planting hundreds of fruit trees,
you know, and it's amazing, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: to see what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Terry Willard telling me,
you know, that the Echinacea farmers were
[SPEAKER_08]: making tons of money, you know,
back in the day and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_08]: Echinacea just got flooded from everywhere
in the world and all of a sudden Echinacea
[SPEAKER_08]: farmers were just lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the point is any one thing can go
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the more that we have, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: as tertiary products, at quadriary
products, whatever, Cinque Terre,
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know where I'm going, but we're
having a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we always have said it isn't about you
being in business for two years,
[SPEAKER_14]: about are you going to be here with a
brand that matters, with an educational
[SPEAKER_14]: force that matters in 10?
[SPEAKER_04]: That
[SPEAKER_14]: something isn't making money, we're going
to go to something else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd love to hear from everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you diversifying with that's
going to keep you here?
[SPEAKER_14]: What's working for you?
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say just on a short thing,
perennial crops, just like things that you
[SPEAKER_17]: can put in that are going to keep giving
you returns with very little input.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really what I'm focused on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do things like blueberries or
things like, you know, fruits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those never really, I mean, people like
the sugary sweets and those things kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: return for years and years and years,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been diversifying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you look at my Instagram,
I post a lot of a decent amount of car
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff from VWs and Audis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, you know, I've kind of had
a knack for automotive mechanics and the
[SPEAKER_07]: used car market's pretty hot right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been kind of saving these old,
you know, 20 year old Volkswagens and
[SPEAKER_07]: Audis, resurrecting them and then,
you know, moving them along to kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: stay afloat after, you know, kind of a
hard season and a hard winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that like using any other
skills, you know, that we pick up from,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, our various experience
throughout life, you know, kind of taking
[SPEAKER_07]: a step back and reflecting on those things
and then trying to, you know, to pivot,
[SPEAKER_07]: to pivot into a more diverse network of
like income streams or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And have you looked into electric
conversions for old VWs?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a lot about like how easy it is
to convert like an old VW bus to electric,
[SPEAKER_08]: like drive it in and then that day you
come out with an electric bus type thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you heard of, is that interesting to
you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just wondering what your thought is
and then we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, that's definitely doable.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with my infrastructure here at the
cabin, you know, I have very rudimentary
[SPEAKER_07]: electricity and I don't have like a
garage.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one structure on my land and it's
pretty much the room that I'm sitting in
[SPEAKER_07]: right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, but my thoughts on the
electric batteries, it's kind of a hard
[SPEAKER_07]: thing to balance in my mind, you know,
with like the mined minerals, the cost,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the difficulty in wiring and
different servos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, you know, I'm not, I wouldn't
say I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would have to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what is everybody else?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, more products.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hear about what people are doing
for secondary things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet there's a way to, you know,
create an alternative energy to do the
[SPEAKER_11]: electrical and the cars.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know I'm in Creston is doing
some amazing work with biofuels and like
[SPEAKER_11]: there must be a way to do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that was a thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really, I'm really interested in that
engineering side of things because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of, you know, overshadowed with a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's also important to get
your engineer on as a farmer, as a,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, as a human being.
[SPEAKER_18]: And talking to a lot of people in
California market, like Canada's market,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's like manufactured products seem to be
much more stable.
[SPEAKER_18]: So our tincture product is actually the
one that's getting us through this spring
[SPEAKER_18]: because that's the only income we're
really, that's reliant.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking for more ideas to develop
on-farm value added, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: with elderberry, get packaged products and
get that out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Elderberries are an amazing crop to grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just produce and they're so stable.
[SPEAKER_19]: We actually have like six different types.
[SPEAKER_19]: This entropic farming years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: And ever since he did, I've been going
down so many rabbit holes on, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: creating these and it's, you know,
it's similar to what we've all been
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about with regenerative farming
and all that, but it's really using
[SPEAKER_19]: biomimicry and, you know, even before
indigenous agriculture, just like the way
[SPEAKER_19]: that nature compiles things and us being
able to learn from that and be able to
[SPEAKER_19]: create these self-sufficient systems that
are going to just keep growing and
[SPEAKER_19]: evolving into these beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_19]: And eventually just become, you know,
its own stable source of everything that
[SPEAKER_19]: it needs.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we've actually been.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're, we're kind of excited about
right now is that where our medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: garden had
[SPEAKER_10]: understory and elderberries are a big part
of that elderberries.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some other just really easy ones
to kind of go to things that are drought
[SPEAKER_19]: resistant, things that you're able to
create shade layers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So other things to be able to get
established and grow through and to,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, more stable canopy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where we just have continuous different
crops coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one of ours is like,
we're looking at how like a permaculture
[SPEAKER_10]: teacher told me, like every farm should
have seven different incomes, seven
[SPEAKER_10]: streams.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been trying to work towards that
for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now with us all like combining forces,
there's four SDM farmers out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm real excited about, you know,
we all have different ideas and figuring
[SPEAKER_10]: out our different paths and we're all
aligned, but it's like, what we really
[SPEAKER_10]: love is the centropic is going to be able
to provide all my commercial herbs,
[SPEAKER_10]: but then also we'll either have hemp or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this next year we'll have tree
layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of bird, ash, legandas, you know,
these ones that I need a lot of,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, for the products and that we all
different kinds of pollinators and
[SPEAKER_19]: coreopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have a top three, like,
uh, perennial berry list that you could
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of shout out right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm looking to plant like three more
different types.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the previous owner of this
homestead head.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Cape gooseberry.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more of a self seeder.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not a perennial, but you know,
you grow one and it's going to keep coming
[SPEAKER_19]: back and it's good.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just spreads.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the amount of berries that you get off
of just one plant is just, it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_19]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's such a delicious, um,
thing to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's such a unique flavor and it's fun to
get down there and kind of harvest every
[SPEAKER_19]: day for your berries and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's very low lying the way that it,
I mean, it could grow tall, depending on
[SPEAKER_19]: if it's reaching for light light or not,
but if it has a nice open area,
[SPEAKER_19]: the way that the arms spread is just,
it's, it's so unique and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Goji.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use the leaves for teas.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also use the berries and I just
like how it spreads and it can be done in
[SPEAKER_10]: any different climates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have a little bit of shade,
I was going to say in Michigan or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blueberries depending on your,
you know, it grows here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was some folks in Ohio that
was doing that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So has anyone, has anyone done Aronia
berries?
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome for a system.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: The me that comes from those.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've done Aronia.
[SPEAKER_17]: It does really good here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of my favorites and it's in
college.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of rough on some things, but Aronia
berries do really well here.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's some, there's so many,
I mean, it really just depends on where
[SPEAKER_19]: you live, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And what your needs are for raspberry for
me is a really big crop here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I use a lot of raspberry leaf and
our smoking blends and teas does really
[SPEAKER_19]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just like always producing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my little one just always goes and eats
the berries and we're harvesting all the
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves and chopping and dropping it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it comes back so vigorous.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's also, it always depends on
what you're kind of user needs are as well
[SPEAKER_10]: as what's going to grow around that area.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alexandra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know another one, which is called just a
berry and that grows even in Alberta,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Calgary area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bush and you can always make cutting so
easily of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, it's a hybrid between a black
currant and gooseberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and the really nice big blue
berries and you can freeze them or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but I would recommend that for
wherever you live, especially for tough
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to have produced them
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will this year have see a whole bunch of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have that written down.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should figure out a way to share all
these resources.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a
[SPEAKER_08]: page and a private one for, for D and pure
family, the private one, no one uses
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore, but it could always be activated
at any time.
[SPEAKER_08]: One berry I would add would be the sea
buckthorn sea buckthorn has been really
[SPEAKER_08]: good for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's an incredible, you know,
one to make medicine and prod products
[SPEAKER_08]: with it's super spiky and weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it like continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It like propagates itself throughout the
ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it can be a lot of skin.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, it's not very tasty,
but it can be put in skincare products.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just is super beautiful for us
really high vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_14]: So anybody out there who has the,
the freeze dryers or they do dehydration
[SPEAKER_14]: at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just really amazing to grind up
and put in for vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I would add one more of the has
cap berry, which is, I believe it's
[SPEAKER_08]: Japanese and maybe wrong about that,
but it's like a blueberry blue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It blooms super early.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually, it's actually from the
honeysuckle family.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was created up here off of a hybrid
honeysuckle in the Calgary area.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's actually Northern and it just
continues to go and go.
[SPEAKER_14]: The only problem with it birds love it at
birds love the berries as well as deer
[SPEAKER_14]: love the leaves.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when the winter time, if you have a lot
of snow, you, you have to cover it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the deer don't get to it, but they are
delicious and they're a true red fruit and
[SPEAKER_14]: they are so plentiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how a blueberry is not quite
blue.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the skin is blue.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a white fruit, but this is red on the
outside and red all the way through.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you work with it and you eat it,
it's just so red, really beautiful fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the dwarf cherries.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this medicinal cherry tree that's
like, it tastes so like weird and bitter,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's dark red.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think I've seen those in Hawaii
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lala, please put these in the chat on the
YouTube for people that would be great
[SPEAKER_14]: because I know people are asking and
Marcus Bale to go bring his, his buddy to
[SPEAKER_14]: a friend's house.
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to be a moderator in YouTube.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like you have to have a blue mod wrench to
be able to put links in that chat.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the only one that can do it is Bingo
Lombardi and 70s mama.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think
[SPEAKER_14]: those were some great ideas with,
with perennials and with berries because
[SPEAKER_14]: they're great on the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else has been doing some amazing
things for some secondary income?
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to also say like different deer
resistant crops and things like that to be
[SPEAKER_19]: able to do bordering around your plants
and things that are really, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: drought resistant that like different
aloes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And being able to use that as,
you know, you could sell it as an input or
[SPEAKER_19]: use it for your farm.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the amount of oxygen that you're
able to get out of it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_19]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're, you know, reproducing and you
can sell
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: The, you know, biodiversity that you can
create with just within that, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: keep telling us really, it's like,
we're only limited by our imagination,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, cause we can grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do so much with what is capable.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a piece of land and you really
are, it's like, it depends on your
[SPEAKER_10]: interest and you really are only limited
by what you can really create and
[SPEAKER_10]: conceive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's when we smoke and enjoy it
really great.
[SPEAKER_10]: It comes in, you can go sit in your garden
and I just just come and flow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like one of ours is right now our
other income source and that we are really
[SPEAKER_10]: loving is teaching.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are doing some education.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a new class, another class coming
up on April 16th.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have fun weekend that we're going to do
cause it's Easter weekend.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're going to do a depth and depth
class of like full on going into all the
[SPEAKER_10]: inputs we use for the year of the year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to talk about how to
make liquid fertilizers, how to make them
[SPEAKER_10]: the herbal solutions, seed blocks,
biochar, lab cultures.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to end it with a lot
of DM farmer talks and then some
[SPEAKER_10]: celebration with music and dancing and
getting up the next day, doing some ganja
[SPEAKER_10]: yoga.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to do some adult kid,
adult and kid Easter egg hunts,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's going to be a fun weekend.
[SPEAKER_10]: But these is one thing that we are really
enjoying doing is events.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in May we have a sesh coming up,
a private event where we're able to do,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a lot of different things
underneath that and allow people to gather
[SPEAKER_10]: and come together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is something that's just really
dear to our hearts right now and that
[SPEAKER_10]: we're really enjoying creating these fun
places for us all to gather and stay in a
[SPEAKER_10]: safe way and also be able to help
ourselves make money right now and our
[SPEAKER_10]: farms survive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's, yeah, that's one of our
important fun things that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot like that we are creating
right now that we're going to keep close,
[SPEAKER_10]: but just know like on our land here,
we're going to be open it up soon to
[SPEAKER_10]: classes and workshops and private events
and healing courses and, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever our imagination kind of comes up
with and that we all, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: are aligned.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tamara has some amazing products that
she makes there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like half a dozen of them on my
shelves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was sweet enough to send Molly
some postpartum stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, she does amazing value-added
products.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, one of the things that- I have to
agree with you, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've tried some of the skincare.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that Elixir, the Echinacea one,
yeah, it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: So good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is why I went legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I remember when Prop 64 passed
and I looked at what we could do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I called my dad up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, dad, we got to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to let us flower out 5k
square foot for seed production.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we've been waiting our whole lives
for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest has been a total shit show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the whole time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, that's my, you know,
I've been packing some seeds up right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do it at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do it in the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely my part-time job that
became the only money that I really saw
[SPEAKER_09]: this winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's from seed sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, without that, I would have
had to, you know, gone to for somebody
[SPEAKER_09]: else to get through the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's been such a blessing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm converting some of the farm to a
little more seed production,
[SPEAKER_09]: expressing 25% auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be doing three types of autos per
bed, but one breeder.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm successful, I'll make 120 new
auto flower hybrids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm growing some haze from noble from
golden fig gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the ones that we're going
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we've been planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of fruit trees, a lot of
food, but the drought's been so hard on us
[SPEAKER_09]: as a mountain farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't have the rain catchment
in storage that I need to farm in a
[SPEAKER_09]: drought.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we'll look forward to in the
future to be able to increase that so that
[SPEAKER_09]: it can really dial in, you know,
more of the polyculture and just,
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a lot of holes to fill in for,
you know, the rest of my life once we get
[SPEAKER_09]: a little more water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is Sarafina.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, baby.
[SPEAKER_14]: Che, did you want to say something?
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw you coming in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like-minded with you all here about
diversity.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do a lot of mushroom production.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got about 10,000 plugs going right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rishi, Lion's Mane, Shiitake, and some big
hoogles.
[SPEAKER_15]: We did some land clearing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we made use of that lumber.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about our big one we call the wall.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about 150 feet and about 17 feet
high.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sort of a Sep Holzer kind of takeoff
massive hoogle bed.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do a lot of feed production that mostly
for our staff and ourselves at this point.
[SPEAKER_15]: The big idea, though, is to here in
Canada, if you can make 10,000 a year in
[SPEAKER_15]: traditional agriculture, because,
of course, cannabis isn't considered
[SPEAKER_15]: agriculture for some crazy reason,
then you can claim farm status.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've been working towards that every
year, adding more and more and just
[SPEAKER_15]: building more and more gardens.
[SPEAKER_15]: The value added line, the product line is
super key.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where we make our money.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're making our profit.
[SPEAKER_15]: The biomass market right now is really a
tough situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's super important to
diversify into value added products if
[SPEAKER_15]: it's possible, because that's actually
what's going to add stability to the
[SPEAKER_15]: company long term.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working with our community here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got this thing called the Rosebuddy
program.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're finding micros shutting down all
over the place right now because of that
[SPEAKER_15]: issue with trying to sell biomass.
[SPEAKER_15]: On a saturated market, and there's not a
lot of interest in small lots because a
[SPEAKER_15]: processor takes on more risk in that
scenario.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'd rather just buy a big lot thousand
kilos.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the people that are getting at the
harshest are the micros, and they're the
[SPEAKER_15]: ones that need it the most because they
have such a small amount of biomass for
[SPEAKER_15]: sale.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're doing is we're providing
genetics.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of our strains are really excited
about this really climatized well to our
[SPEAKER_15]: region and support.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do a regenerative slash health Canada,
Canada revenue, just support call once a
[SPEAKER_15]: week or excuse me, every second week,
just to kind of navigate through all these
[SPEAKER_15]: things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the idea is, although we're still
not quite there yet, is to buy the biomass
[SPEAKER_15]: back from these farmers at a fair market
value.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll put that into our own product
line.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't, of course, we can't do this
regenerative on mass scale.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so in order to get into the stores,
we need more biomass.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've capped our site.
[SPEAKER_15]: At a fairly small footprint to keep that
regenerative and high quality craft.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, craft is a new category here
in Canada to pretty excited to have a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: of input on the creation of that category.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's another opportunity to help us
survive in this market as small producers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, some of the other things were
really just keep looking at stacking
[SPEAKER_15]: functions, diversifying.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm actually excited about a bit away
is T, we one of our guild, one of our
[SPEAKER_04]: support species to do a lot of mint,
do a lot of key.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love what you're it's important what
you're doing up here, Shane and people
[SPEAKER_08]: that really appreciate you and all the
Rose buddies are all, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: part of our family and starting to be and
pure certified too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we'll probably do more of
these hashes with other peer certified
[SPEAKER_08]: farms that, you know, aren't on here now
so they can tell their story as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also think that some region camps
would be good at your spot, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: for the for for this area for British
Columbia to
[SPEAKER_08]: do something, you know, in our bio region.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to continue talking about
regenerative practices like farming to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I didn't want to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had something to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just be all into that, like this
diversity overlaps beyond our business,
[SPEAKER_15]: but into our community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really the picture.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like this plant is a power plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's super duper key and important,
but it's just one plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's part of a big closed loop system,
which is our community, small and large,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, our world community.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we can do things here to support
people, to support themselves and support
[SPEAKER_15]: their community, just like regenerative
classes, but food production and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, all of the things, all of the
things and how they all connect together,
[SPEAKER_15]: body, mind and soul, you know,
from meditation and how you take care of
[SPEAKER_15]: yourself to how you take care of your
land.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how you take care of your community.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm super excited that we're all
joining together and we have beautiful
[SPEAKER_15]: place like where we live to demonstrate
these things, to actually not just talk
[SPEAKER_15]: about them, but demonstrate them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And collectively, we all have our niches.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all have our powers and we can show our
one or two or five amazing things we've
[SPEAKER_15]: done that the next farm hasn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: But so collectively, we can debate a
better world pretty easy, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm stoked to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me and Craig were just talking about that
the other day, how much, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've all vibed off each other over all
these years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've just seen everyone's farm come
up, including our own.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've been doing this a long
time and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 16 years now on this farm, you know,
a lot of bounty.
[SPEAKER_08]: But every single time I have a
conversation with someone, I feel like I
[SPEAKER_08]: pick up, you know, support.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I have something I'd like to address.
[SPEAKER_20]: The chat, there was someone that said that
they have a hard time getting seeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that would be a great time to
address this right now, because we do have
[SPEAKER_20]: a breeder on the panel, lots of breeders
on this panel that I know.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they all ship seeds all over the
world, I think.
[SPEAKER_20]: So reach out, DM them.
[SPEAKER_20]: They probably can't do it through
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_20]: You probably have to do through email.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's different weird things going on
with that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So you guys reach out and get to know
people.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I was just at an amazing seed swap.
[SPEAKER_20]: Kush Kirk put on this amazing event with
some amazing hash seed swaps.
[SPEAKER_20]: The amazing Dempure family was there just
putting on this event.
[SPEAKER_20]: Joey and Tamara, they put on them all
over.
[SPEAKER_20]: The seeds are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're gifting them.
[SPEAKER_20]: You bring seeds, you can gift them to
people.
[SPEAKER_20]: You can sell them.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's like so much going on.
[SPEAKER_20]: So seeds aren't hard to find.
[SPEAKER_20]: You just really have to make a little bit
of effort to get out there and get to know
[SPEAKER_20]: people.
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes a little effort if you want
things.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you just got to do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And literally, you know, Sierra's parents,
the peach orchard team, they are literally
[SPEAKER_20]: selling packs of beans for 20 bucks at the
seed swap.
[SPEAKER_20]: Also giving out free- Snodgrass family
genetics.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Giving out free lettuce seeds and flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's about uniting and getting together as
a family and sharing.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks everyone for being here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, like Duke said earlier,
watch out for the scammers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many scammers out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, if you're following
someone, look at the tag section on
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: These scammers can't fake this,
you know, not very well.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be maybe one of their own other scam
pages.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, I'm sure if you pulled up
Duke's page or my page, like Pride Aligned
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeds, you would see people growing our
gear, posting about that gear.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, just be careful out there
when you're approaching someone on
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch for the scammers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot about the night company, just putting
A and B together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you go, here's C.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really care about your garden
or anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you do diligence?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stick to those reputable people
that are, you know, putting in the work,
[SPEAKER_02]: showing the love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really is going to translate to
your garden because you know, from your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, your inputs and everything,
your environment, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you're going to be able to
hit genetic potential, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the best of your ability with all those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have everything to the nines,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the genetics aren't there,
you're not going to do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you're newer,
newer to growing, maybe it's your first
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that kind of, sometimes it'll
deter people away from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing their own and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of sad too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just make sure that you do your due
diligence and go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, like we were just
talking about like, you know, your
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, you know, and certain people,
it's their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what they do for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, you know, the guy's working
wherever and at night time he just chucks
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cause it good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people like myself, like that's
what I do for a living, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got other things I do as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a little bit of engineering,
a little bit of design work for people if
[SPEAKER_02]: they need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar arrays, you know, smart controllers,
you know, for greenhouses, like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like custom stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also educational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your own, you know, rating green and,
you know, your fat flowers and like you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you got somebody living in
the city, like they can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or some people just don't have the time or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the products available, you can get it
from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michelle and I had a problem with the
sharing of that, you know, and they all
[SPEAKER_02]: were like so awesome about just teaching
people and, you know, just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, saw some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always told people like,
yeah, here's how you mix the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: yada yada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like I don't have room for
that or man, it seems like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured, hey, for those folks,
you know, take a tip from Josh and Kelly,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it available to people, you know,
otherwise, you know, they can just make
[SPEAKER_02]: their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of, kind of what I'm doing
for my multiple revenue streams like the
[SPEAKER_04]: set of business folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, the way how I grow, I always make
sure that I collect in my own seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just from the cannabis, of course,
but also from everything else of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I noticed as you probably
did too, your own seeds are always much
[SPEAKER_01]: more full of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up and like almost a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's also super important that
people know how to grow their own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how, whether it's in a
farm or in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years and years ago, I was told to make
sure to educate people that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing their own food because we will
come to a point where that will be not
[SPEAKER_01]: available anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that already how it happened,
but it's now through the virus what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know it from my family in
Germany because of whatever happened in,
[SPEAKER_01]: to Ukraine, supplies are suddenly not
happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the nature itself tells already
it's a diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my many years of growing gardens,
there's always something that doesn't turn
[SPEAKER_01]: out and something else that turns out much
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way of nature saying, hey,
this year you need much more beets or you
[SPEAKER_01]: need much more beans, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I wanted to ask you, do you have
any experience of keeping your seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you including the cannabis,
of course, but also other seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just put them into a cold storage
or do you have any experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: freezing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezing the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that like it was like a common
mistake was people were starting to put
[SPEAKER_02]: things in a freezer way too early,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still moisture there and
[SPEAKER_02]: eight weeks like extreme dry time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't bundle things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've seen some people put them all in
a jar right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a turkey pan or whatever you got,
something that's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking to hold moisture and lay them
all out nice and nice and flat and making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that they got that good long dry
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're good and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from pollen to seeds and everything,
I personally, I like to break everything
[SPEAKER_02]: down into like what I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of putting 500 or 100 or
whatever seeds together, I'm looking like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is a single use for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what would I be taking out to use
that way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not bringing the whole bulk in and out
of the freezer, condensation and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything can happen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something freezer safe container wise,
but within that, I like to break
[SPEAKER_02]: everything down into like what I would
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So individual pack of say cannabis seeds,
I might have 15 together or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can break out exactly what I
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for your long-term storage,
that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know like you're going to be using
it, you know, respectively in the near
[SPEAKER_02]: future, I like just a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Refrigerator does good for like what you
know, you're going to be getting into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the freezer for long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're kind of like replicating
on a stratification you would see out in
[SPEAKER_02]: nature anyway, with, you know,
summer going into fall, winter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then back to spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always had real, real good
results like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long do you think can a seed last
in a freezer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a really, really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody brought up A.K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beanbrains at the beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's, he had stuff in there at
well over 20 years and broke them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: germinated them and you know, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely keeps them, keeps them,
keeps them well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, the trick is, you know,
keeping it, keeping it like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so, and like he hasn't moved,
you know, he's been living in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: place forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes it easy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you got it frozen, you know,
keep it frozen until you need what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're storing, just make sure
that you're putting in there like sizable,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what you, what you need and not
going, you know, back in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a nice container, you know,
something freezer safe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah, you're, you're good to go and
label, label everything accordingly,
[SPEAKER_02]: like to put dates on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of, you know, have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's also a good information
for everyone else, because when I do like
[SPEAKER_01]: carrot seeds, I did my own carrot seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing, but I have so much,
of course, from one little plant to get
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to keep it because carrot seeds also
can be really quickly not be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will put all those into a little
packages and, and then have your own seed
[SPEAKER_01]: security.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to like a place that sells
like beads and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: normally they, they have like little small
containers that are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you can find like the vials or
something like that, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you can find like little small
packages to keep your stuff in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a place I used to order my
bags from a CD packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can get like the friendly
biodegradable bags too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can take it up, take it up a
notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the little green seal on it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like the same price as a
normal plastic baggie or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going, you know, it used to be
like, so like my father, he grew up
[SPEAKER_02]: through the great depression and
everything, farmer and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was always instilled from me
early on growing vegetables and some fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: trees and canning things for the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's just kind of like what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I traveled around and got
away from there, it's like, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody else really does this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you're running a farm,
hell man, like you, if you can cut costs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause like, you know,
bringing money's in, but saving money is
[SPEAKER_02]: even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you can grow your own
food, you know, you're not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: spending out canning things and,
you know, go to farmer's markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: sell you jellies and jams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people will talk about your teas and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're, you know, cutting costs to
them, you know, living in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's always a great way to make some
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and efficiency, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put
[SPEAKER_01]: my seats in there and ride it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way how my recycle works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe put a little something into make
sure it's not getting moist in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie and Rio, I saw you guys were wanting
to say something, but Rio walked out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie, did you want to jump in?
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a question because someone asked in
chat in our chat here about freeze drying
[SPEAKER_20]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like maybe that's a good topic to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anybody know about that?
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't freeze dry seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't freeze dry seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it makes them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushroom spores, I think is the only thing
that you can like freeze dry and relive
[SPEAKER_09]: that I know of.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just want to replicate what the plant
is going to do and its ultimate optimal
[SPEAKER_14]: conditions and for it to come back.
So that's what it's kind of a.
I mean, that's really, you know,
how you go.
To it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the, the kind of like year after
year, just like Duke was saying,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you really want to dry that out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know for us, we've been doing some
secondary things.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got involved in all the Saturday
markets.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done Saturday markets.
[SPEAKER_14]: in years past.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this year we decided that we were
going to jump in and do all Saturday
[SPEAKER_14]: markets and get our crew on making sure to
get, you know, our salads and some
[SPEAKER_14]: secondary product, you know, whatever
we've got excess in the garden,
[SPEAKER_14]: because so much of it goes to our
chickens.
[SPEAKER_14]: So much of it goes to our compost that we
really want to make a really concerted
[SPEAKER_14]: effort because we also put away a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So because we have so much abundance I
also really want to talk to people who
[SPEAKER_14]: have abundance on their farms is to let's
start hooking up with people who can take
[SPEAKER_14]: it to market because so much of it is just
being composted.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of youthful people that
want to be involved in this regenerative
[SPEAKER_14]: culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, people who want to get a
hold of people who are growing foods and
[SPEAKER_14]: say, hey, if you all are wasting any,
we'd like to come out once a week and get
[SPEAKER_14]: that to market or get it to the homeless.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that everybody is seeing what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have more homeless people in North
America, in the world than ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to know that regenerative farms have
access.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is also where licensing just makes me
so fucking pissed off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that there's cannabis that's even being
like burned because it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can donate it for the maximum value of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a tax write off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can donate it and get it to these
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's people who and can't even get
it to a processor to get it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen people like burning it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more just like, you know,
those people who burn sports jerseys
[SPEAKER_09]: because someone got traded to another
team.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like I don't quite.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, honestly, we've definitely
composted a tremendous amount,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, in the past, maybe because,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And and just in years and years and years,
you look at like our outdoor crops for
[SPEAKER_14]: time to go and changes in markets and
changes in politics.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just, you know, when you're in the
industry for 30 years, all we're saying is
[SPEAKER_14]: a different values in different medicines.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's different values.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like what Josh had mentioned in Echinacea,
you know, if you put all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe everybody is starting to grow
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then the price of blueberries in
your area grows, goes down tremendously.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you have to make a secondary
product with those blueberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: So just really thinking outside of the
box.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that vinegars and alcohol are
something that we could really look into
[SPEAKER_08]: making more of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, vinegar is really easy to make.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a really useful extract for
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even psychedelic mushrooms can be
extracted with vinegars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really healthy for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's a fermentation that lasts
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can clean with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having your own your own still
what legality is, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: having your own still makes all the sense
in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you're making your own alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making your own teachers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're making your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why it was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too useful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that's been made illegal,
start learning about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's the whole point is it's
empowering you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not what they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an empowerment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Learning how to make alcohol is very
useful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And vinegar is like now CNN is going to
take that one little clip.
[SPEAKER_08]: They already forgot about us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as we're talking about the ethers,
I want to bring in the way I've been
[SPEAKER_11]: gardening the last year just to kind of
put a little bit of an icing on this
[SPEAKER_11]: lovely cake that we're fucking making
together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, cussing in church.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been so I just want to say real
quick, this is not that kind of church.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember taking at church either.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's take some hits on that note.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, I've been going super deep on
Web 3.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only do we have to shift value and add
value and build
[SPEAKER_11]: and we don't have to find our community.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to be able to key in with the
community that we already have and really
[SPEAKER_11]: get just heartfelt feedback from the
community.
And so that's what we're going to be
doing.
We're going to be building a community.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be establishing that and
support each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three stuff is so cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anything you want to know about it,
the NFT stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just about products.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about it's about contracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about relationships.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's about gaining our creativity back
so we can start articulate what it is to
[SPEAKER_11]: own our own, not only like data,
but but like our own livelihood and to
[SPEAKER_11]: come together in livelihood overlays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's just such elegance out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people doing amazing
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just get in touch with me if you want
to know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm about to save my farm through this
articulate contractual beauty thing that's
[SPEAKER_11]: going to help every other farm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyone who wants to play with me in
that field, come play because we're going
[SPEAKER_11]: to do festivals together.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do all this stuff that
we're going to know what each other is
[SPEAKER_11]: doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be able to trap to see each
other.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to have a meal train if I want and
come up to Canada and see everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you, did you go to the Hot Springs
for that seed swap?
[SPEAKER_02]: The other, what was that, last weekend or
weekend before?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I haven't really ventured out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been stuck to my screen for a year,
but I've been working hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you said like you were out around
Crestone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was at Crestone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of people in Crestone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we should talk to you because you're
in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was over in Moffitt and then the
next day I went to Joyful Journey and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had a seed swap there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was there that week though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were in Crestone at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually lived in Crestone for Moffitt
for a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was literally just there and I was
like, I know this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the face or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I lived in Steamboat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We lived in Steamboat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We and Kelly drove to Costa Rica and back
in a Volkswagen bus in 1994.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we came back from Costa Rica,
we took our stuff from Guatemala and sold
[SPEAKER_08]: it in Boulder on the street and got a
house in Steamboat.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a sweet condo at the base.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the weed wasn't good enough at that
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to bail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to go grow it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't work at Steamboat Springs
because I had earrings and long hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at first, I tried putting my hair up,
earrings out, and I even passed the weed
[SPEAKER_08]: test because I did the niacin and a bunch
of goldenseal and I passed the weed test.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to see me with long hair
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to hire me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just did construction all year in 25
below weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we left because the weed wasn't that
great then.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to call it the Rocky Mountain
High.
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, it was all swag weed in
Steamboat at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all Mexican.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were sending out this purple kush at
the time from Southern Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was like the craziest purple,
like Tara Lee's bright purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fuchsia purple when it was,
I don't know if anyone remembers the
[SPEAKER_08]: purple from the late 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why purple kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't really see it in the same way.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one goes like, dude, check out my
purple kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: But back in the day, that was some of the
most skunky, gnarly shit in Southern
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were sending it out to Colorado,
you know, and then it was just getting too
[SPEAKER_14]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Craig, were you in Steam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where were you at in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was in Steamboat in 92 to 94.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I left right before you guys got there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, the the herb was all right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a couple of folks that had a had
a little something something going on and
[SPEAKER_12]: produced some decent herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the most part, it was garbage.
[SPEAKER_12]: Steamboat was more about blow back then.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of crazy what type of town it
was and the kind of the the gray cloud
[SPEAKER_12]: that would hang over it because of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I'm glad Colorado got the herb
scene figured out a little bit better for
[SPEAKER_12]: the sake of the the poppy population in
all these rural mountain towns.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not easy to grow cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not easy to grow anything in
Colorado, to be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, unless you're going to dig up and
replace and do ridiculous things to make
[SPEAKER_11]: it like limp along until suddenly you hit
such imbalances, you're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have these differentials in
temperature that really literally swing 60
[SPEAKER_11]: degrees and you've got no season like the
next season.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm trying to naturalize cannabis
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been doing it for seven years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually asked Duke a question at
one of his seed panels.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he gave me such support and just
because I was scared of what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've got babies coming up there every
out there every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And every year I get surprised by some
little anomaly and I just keep throwing
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Craig gave me a little bag of something at
the region conference.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's making its way out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, that's my crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when it was tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have a thing to add?
[SPEAKER_14]: We were talking about tinctures and
alcohols and shrugs and vinegars and self
[SPEAKER_14]: reliance.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you wanted to talk tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want something to say?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have something to say?
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of don't remember now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's always something to say on
self reliance.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, that's definitely one thing I
have wanted to achieve here is like the
[SPEAKER_10]: apple vinegars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why like behind us,
we have the apple tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a few years old, you know,
planted in 2017.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another and every year we're
getting more and more.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's like with those fruit trees,
you have real abundance.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like your fruit trees in first.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one tip that I always like to tell
people who are just getting land or you've
[SPEAKER_10]: had land for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the best time to plant a fruit
tree is now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you got any more you got any new
products you're excited about tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have a few.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got the herbal syrup, which I started
doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the one where it's I've got,
let's see, it's nettle, horsetail,
[SPEAKER_10]: rose hips, echinacea, burdock root and
dandelion root.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've mixed that together with
some local honey.
[SPEAKER_10]: That we have and the local honey has some
of our CBD infused into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that CBD is coming from the RSO that
we create.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's infused into the honey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the honey gets infused into this
really strong decoction of all these
[SPEAKER_10]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in that goes an ounce of or half
an ounce of like California poppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do the whole plant poppy tincture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I do a whole plant dandelion sure
that goes in that as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are like some of my favorite
things I've been creating lately that and
[SPEAKER_10]: I do a two to one with THC to CBD and then
the high CBD of like 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so then I'm working on a facial line
right now where it's like I have the
[SPEAKER_10]: exfoliant, a nice sugar scrub.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have your facial oil
cleanser.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you have your facial oil and also in
between that you have your rose hydrosol
[SPEAKER_10]: and then there is a cream.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are what I really enjoy playing with
and created Heal Thy Self Gardens product
[SPEAKER_10]: line to be able to expand as I expand and
grow and add products with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the more abundance that we have with
our herbs as we keep growing our gardens
[SPEAKER_10]: here, the more abundance we have,
the more the product line can grow and the
[SPEAKER_10]: more ideas come.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, thanks for asking that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Craig, you know, we were talking
earlier about your farm and we were
[SPEAKER_14]: wanting to know you didn't say when you
introduced what varietals that you're
[SPEAKER_14]: gonna be running this year and why.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that you're working with some
really amazing extracts and I just wanted
[SPEAKER_14]: to know, you know, what are you running?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we made a conscious decision a few
years back to really, with what we opened
[SPEAKER_12]: up the show with, with like Appalachians
and having that taste of Tawar,
[SPEAKER_12]: really, you have to really start thinking
about what your goal is and that was for
[SPEAKER_12]: us to grow resin and to produce hash with
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only produce hash, but we also
wanted to keep the regenerative mindset or
[SPEAKER_12]: regenerative practices moving forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we partnered with Nasha Extracts right
here in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_12]: Baron Lutz is the owner and operator of
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we wanted to bring forward nothing
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we didn't want to have all these
regenerative practices to plug a condenser
[SPEAKER_12]: into it until it's consumed and have it
plugged into the grid.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Baron is so supportive of trying to
push this forward through the entire
[SPEAKER_12]: California market where we just released a
black box series and it is our farm cured
[SPEAKER_12]: resin, rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's been great success.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the cultivar we used was Guava Gift.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we worked with Green Source Gardens.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing with it, with going with the
Guava Gift, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_12]: producing for resin, you know,
you could go with a GMO, which would be
[SPEAKER_12]: like an industrial standard, and it's
going to produce amazing clear resin and
[SPEAKER_12]: it's going to return it, you know,
over 20%, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then you have these outliers,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Guava Gift came through and
produced it, you know, between 17 and 18%.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it still produces well, but it has the
terpene profile, the richness,
[SPEAKER_12]: the depth that some of these more
mainstream cultivars don't have.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's important to support these
breeders that are pushing the boundaries
[SPEAKER_12]: and trying to pull trichomes out of these
deeper lines and not just grab a GMO and,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, do some pollen chucking like
Duke was saying here, and to go deep into
[SPEAKER_12]: their vaults and pull some of these land
races out and start going for those waxier
[SPEAKER_12]: trichomes so we can do some extraction
around that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be truthful, that's really what has
been a differentiator for our farm is,
[SPEAKER_12]: number one, going deep into our
regenerative practice, not scaling.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've learned that scaling is really
failing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And finding that perfect model for how
many people actually live on your farm,
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's kind of how big of a footprint
you can have.
[SPEAKER_12]: Close that loop within that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We see that happening on a couple of the
farms here, whether it's here,
[SPEAKER_12]: Hilda itself, or Lady Sativa.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Lady Sativa and, you know,
you've got three generations running
[SPEAKER_12]: around that farm and Rio's trying to look
at, try to build minimal housing
[SPEAKER_12]: infrastructure to support that because you
have the farm as your front yard and your
[SPEAKER_12]: living room.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no need to have all this
massive roof space and, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: industrial footprint on the farm when you
can just utilize what's out your front
[SPEAKER_12]: door.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think for us, like I said,
it's the choosing of the cultivars and
[SPEAKER_12]: working within the network to find what
really works.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing that really surprises
a lot of folks when we talk about our farm
[SPEAKER_12]: in particular and our model is we're only
10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_12]: 75% of that is all from seed, sungrown,
you know, full season.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from seed, I forgot if I mentioned
that, and then the second component is 25%
[SPEAKER_12]: of our farm, the 2,500 square feet is
light depth.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I should say it's just sungrown and we
just use an occlusion to block some of
[SPEAKER_12]: that sunlight.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we get one extra harvest a year and
it's not really even a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a hoop structure to support that
occlusion tarp to block the sun.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then our second round is a set it and
forget it, I call it, where we just put
[SPEAKER_12]: the plant straight in, do nothing,
and that one always goes whole plant to
[SPEAKER_12]: resin production because we've learned
with that second run that, and especially
[SPEAKER_12]: when you started growing for resin,
you've got enough going on, especially
[SPEAKER_12]: with 75% of our production being seed
grown, sungrown, and that takes up a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of time that time of year.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we like having that last or second
round of depth, even though we're not
[SPEAKER_12]: depping it, to be this specifically for
resin, the bud size can be small.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not judging the flower, the
inflorescence of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just really monitoring the resin and
ready for the peak production and the most
[SPEAKER_12]: flavor and the best for extraction.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are a little bit, you know,
that kind of ties into a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: what we were talking about earlier on what
we can do on the farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to tie in one other piece to
what we can do on the farm to revenue
[SPEAKER_12]: stream.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I made brief mention that we did
some activism and activism brought,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, over $4 million, four weeks of
work, $4 million didn't have to leave our
[SPEAKER_12]: pockets in our humble County, you know,
farmer network.
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes when we're dealing with such
a parasitic supply line and taxation,
[SPEAKER_12]: how do we protect ourselves from those
parasites?
[SPEAKER_12]: So the other thing we're doing is we're
doing a lot of just self-education on how
[SPEAKER_12]: to do some of our own compliance work and
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many things we have to do with
the water board and all these documents
[SPEAKER_12]: and websites and
[SPEAKER_12]: conserve and, and work with each other to
get rid of a lot of the parasites in the
[SPEAKER_12]: supply line.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to say, Craig, I just love
listening to you.
[SPEAKER_20]: You always speak so well.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I had the privilege of going to
Craig's farm.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_20]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And is that the hash that I got to smoke
the one that you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, I think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Fire, fire.
[SPEAKER_20]: I have smoked some amazing fire and that
was amazing fire.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the privilege and the honor
to visit your farm.
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you, Josh and Kelly,
because through you, I have met this
[SPEAKER_20]: amazing family and continues.
[SPEAKER_20]: It continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_20]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for that Tara.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really want to shine light on,
on, on Baron's work at Nasha, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like in a, in the California market right
now, when fresh frozen is like it,
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's got to be purple gas and blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not interested in that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, he's in over 300 shops just
doing this farm cured resin and,
[SPEAKER_12]: and how important that is.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys check out our Instagram at
Alpenglowfarm707, you can see some of
[SPEAKER_12]: these melt shots of the, of the guava
gift.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just this beautiful amber.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing with, you know, resin,
farm cured rosin, and you do get down the
[SPEAKER_12]: supply line as it goes out, you will get a
little haze over it and there's nothing to
[SPEAKER_12]: fret there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it gets a little buttered
looking, but the flavor and the turps are
[SPEAKER_12]: solid.
[SPEAKER_20]: So as a regular hash smoker, I only dab.
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a big difference between live and
cured and what you're talking about that
[SPEAKER_20]: cured all that really gets someone really
has a hard time dabbing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're like constantly coughing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the thing that they really hate
about it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause I find as, as I go through the
communities and I talk to people about
[SPEAKER_20]: dabbing, they're like, God, I just hate
that coughing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I feel like I can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm like, well, first of all,
you're taking too big of a dab,
[SPEAKER_20]: but you know, bring that back.
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, that cured stuff that you're
talking about, it's off gas, all that
[SPEAKER_20]: really, really, you know, cost.
[SPEAKER_12]: The model terpenes you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: Model terpenes will give you the harvest
hack.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think so people, if you,
if you get a chance to try them both,
[SPEAKER_20]: they're, they're definitely is different.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a difference there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, Sarah, one thing, one thing that
we actually just had the conversation with
[SPEAKER_12]: Baron, we're going to be doing a side by
side.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're, we're actually going to do a
batch of fresh frozen, not to uplift that
[SPEAKER_12]: market so much, but to just really get
some data points around a side by side.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the same cultivar grown in the same
farm, you know, kind of do our own
[SPEAKER_12]: challenge and get the data points from the
testing and consumers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a really exciting, and it's
going to be a white box.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have the white box, black box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's super sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really, it's an amazing point that
activism can be something that adds to
[SPEAKER_08]: your profit at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, especially in Canada,
it's really, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shay knows.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a lot of taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's there's something that
everyone's so yeah, just that's what we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to do with this Canada summit coming
up is talk about, you know, ways that FARs
[SPEAKER_08]: can diversify through farm gate sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: And not having to go through distributors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people like going through
distributors and distributors can make
[SPEAKER_08]: sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in other cases, it's nice when you can
directly communicate with your consumers
[SPEAKER_08]: and get products and also getting rid of
microbial testing that which we have here
[SPEAKER_08]: in Canada is an invasive microbial testing
system, which makes it to where you can't
[SPEAKER_08]: actually get true herbal medicine to the
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: In many cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shay is doing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shay is doing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very difficult, but he's doing it
through the topicals and always trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: make the way through the market,
you know, so I just.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if maybe someone can
speak about the California market and the
[SPEAKER_08]: sense of testing, like just testing for
human pathogens as opposed to just blank
[SPEAKER_08]: up telling for all my CFM or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems ridiculous that we are still
having this conference.
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we still having this conversation?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're still having this conversation
because the other side, the corporate
[SPEAKER_14]: entity doesn't want to grow good,
beautiful, healthy, medicinal,
[SPEAKER_14]: taste good, make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Make you be able to elevate your
mindscape.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of these things are what legacy
farmers, regenerative farmers are creating
[SPEAKER_14]: the inside of the secondary metabolites,
which happened through the microbiome of
[SPEAKER_14]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you have a set microbiome of a plant,
that means it's coming from the soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we're talking about regeneratively
growing a plant, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_14]: regenerative soil growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamma radiate your weed in order to get it
to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question to you all, what advice do you
have to Canada and Canadian policymakers
[SPEAKER_08]: having to do with gamma radiation,
microbe testing, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and making it to where people
can sell to consumers?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we don't even have the ability.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't even have the ability to put
your like logo.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can say where it's from, but say like,
Shay can't say all of the different farms
[SPEAKER_14]: that he gets his biomass from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we don't know and you can tell
us if we're wrong on the label.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too small.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you might have these weird
fold out labels here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, the thing is they took
away the organic certification for indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: growing in Canada and they have this
invasive microbial testing, which makes it
[SPEAKER_08]: to where you have to essentially mostly
radiate the weed to get it to the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: What advice do you have to Canadian
policymakers?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go hand to hand because
we're going to go hand to hand and we're
[SPEAKER_11]: doing it anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be doing trade hand to hand
through these relational networks that
[SPEAKER_11]: blockchain makes available to us,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: We get to write our own contracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I say that my I'm going to be
supported through my ecosystem and then my
[SPEAKER_11]: ecosystem is going to be nested within a
larger ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything is linked by that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's relational.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do business with you because I know
you and I see you and I love you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing it anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you all want to get on with the
program and be loving humans on this
[SPEAKER_11]: planet, then officials, can you kindly,
with great heart, listen to us because
[SPEAKER_11]: we're speaking the language of Earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have good news.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can feed each other and have abundant
thriving loss.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's exactly what I would say to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the common sense approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, having like, you know,
white papers and actually like scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and back it up and don't give them a
dictionary, highlight, excerpt parts,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it together well formulated for a
dummy that works in the government to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand because you're not always the
sharpest folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make it easy, spoon fed,
but you cite where you get it from,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's from and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and just show like maybe
where somehow it would be cost effective
[SPEAKER_02]: to them to eliminate that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're adding like a benefit to them as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's full on reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's kind of winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cite the facts like, yeah,
you're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you're helping people and,
you know, give it to them in a nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, nice little package that you can
just say, here you go on your silver
[SPEAKER_02]: platter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's hard to fight,
you know, people that are going behind
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, from the heart and,
you know, just the common sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: also being backed up by irrefutable,
you know, this fucking fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you give it to them like that,
you know, they'd be hard pressed to tell a
[SPEAKER_02]: group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking about the same
people that cut weed illegal, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: that were refuting facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you know, maybe they'll do the
right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, definitely one of the biggest
hurdles that we have up here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_14]: and it isn't a very good reflection for
the rest of the world as far as being
[SPEAKER_14]: federally legal, is that all of our
legislation within the cannabis reality
[SPEAKER_14]: and whole licensing is under Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: That means Health Canada talks about what
we do with our plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, of course, all of those reflections
are going to be more towards the
[SPEAKER_14]: pharmaceutical market because it's Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Ministry of Ag.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not treating the plants as if it
should be something coming out of the
[SPEAKER_14]: ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're actually having to fight to get that
type of education out that plants come
[SPEAKER_14]: from the ground and that microbials are
something that actually helps the plant
[SPEAKER_14]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea on this sort of left turn
that cannabis continues to have as well as
[SPEAKER_14]: plant medicine to dumb it down by
isolating it and putting it into
[SPEAKER_14]: pharmaceutical hands.
[SPEAKER_14]: When we put into pharmaceutical hands,
it is no longer medicine, and that is not
[SPEAKER_14]: at all what regenerative practices are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not what created the legalization to
begin with because what created the
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization to begin with was its
medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when Craig is talking about all of
these amazing values that you get from his
[SPEAKER_14]: sun-grown, purely dried, gorgeous rosin
from his farm, what you're getting is
[SPEAKER_14]: you're getting secondary metabolites that
aren't even registered yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't even have the scientific data.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I loved what you were saying over and
over, Craig.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're going to get the data on
this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all I kept thinking was the DABA
because you're going to be like dabbing to
[SPEAKER_14]: do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys are going to be taking the
DABA on that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, the data is a grandma joke.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: The data on that right now is that it's
all taken from indoor.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of it is from Israel.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of it is from Canada, all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a full balanced holistic biome
that the plant has to even produce these
[SPEAKER_14]: incredible secondary metabolites that
haven't even been studied yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the data we're getting is from a
totally dumbed down source to begin with.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is new data coming out though that
I've seen from different outdoor farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're having to force that data.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like run by governments.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not run by these ministries that need
to jump forward to realize the value of
[SPEAKER_14]: putting it in the hands of Department of
Agriculture because they have,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're going to be able to create more
value in creating a holistic plant that
[SPEAKER_14]: comes out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Decentralized science.
[SPEAKER_11]: DSI.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will hook you up with some DSI.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, one of the things that
our group is working on is we always
[SPEAKER_12]: evaluate the new bills coming through and
wondering if they make sense for our group
[SPEAKER_12]: to support or not to support.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need to look at Arizona.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need to look at these other
states and have some sort of pack to sell
[SPEAKER_12]: our products there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we need to first work on our home
state and move out from there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be the one thing I would
probably share with the folks in Canada is
[SPEAKER_12]: to start working with your, I don't know
your government structure, but your county
[SPEAKER_12]: or your Providence and then move out from
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the other thing that is going to
happen here, at least in this country,
[SPEAKER_12]: is New York is building out, New Jersey is
building out.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to have massive taxation for
my product to come into their state.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then there'll be states like Oregon and
Nevada and Arizona that will probably want
[SPEAKER_12]: to bring their products into California.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not so exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's something to, definitely
want to get the medicine out.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: We definitely want to share.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's wrong with experiential
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's wrong with having the experience
when you come to that home state?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be taxed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody else is going to try to figure
out how to make some more money on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's come as close to the farm to get
these products and have these experiences
[SPEAKER_12]: with us.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of the conversation we have with
Soulful at the dispensary we're partnered
[SPEAKER_12]: with is the dashboard that people use to
purchase cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at a menu.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at this percent,
that terpene, that.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I was out front, we always joke about
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I was out front, 11 jars and rolling
joints, I'd sell out every single time,
[SPEAKER_12]: every single time, anywhere I went.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could be the guy selling oranges on the
corner down at the bottom of my hill,
[SPEAKER_12]: setting up my weed stand next to him,
and I'd be sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it in the hands of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let go patient and affordable.
[SPEAKER_20]: Less hands involved, less money,
less taxes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Agrotainment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go deep into agrotainment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trade route.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, more events, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love these farmers markets, whether
they're legal, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about just bringing the people to
the farmer, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all sell our own stuff way better.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can sit there and tell you all the
things that my products do and my herb,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I do lots of one-to-ones and different
CBD ratios.
[SPEAKER_10]: But who else is going to tell all that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who else is going to tell the story behind
how all that happened?
[SPEAKER_19]: It gets diluted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it gets diluted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just becomes false, too, if you tell
the same big story over and over.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all marketed, and it's like,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they were supposed to give us time
as legacy farmers to establish ourselves
[SPEAKER_19]: in this transitional world that we've been
going through, and they didn't.
[SPEAKER_19]: They opened up the floodgates in Uslinas
Valley, and places like that are covered
[SPEAKER_19]: in 50, 75-acre lots of subpar cannabis
that's bottlenecking into the industry,
[SPEAKER_19]: and it makes it tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think coming together more.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all could tighten up if we have to go
under.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we go under?
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's like we do have these events.
[SPEAKER_10]: We create it where people can come direct
to the farmer and get what they want and
[SPEAKER_10]: need and know that it's grown in these
beautiful ways, and then at the same time,
[SPEAKER_10]: having to keep fighting the fight of
pushing regenerative farming and what this
[SPEAKER_10]: does and the data and collecting it and
being like, here, pushing that,
[SPEAKER_10]: but at the same time, how are we going to
make it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like there's a lot of power in
gathering together and creating.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's too much of a barrier between the
farmer and the consumer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Talk to a lot of bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, there's not as much of a
educational curve involved with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that needs to be handled,
I think, a lot more within the shop
[SPEAKER_19]: industry and retail industry and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's what DEM is really
beautiful for and what I really love about
[SPEAKER_19]: it, how it's a peer-to-peer network of
people that are on that same wavelength
[SPEAKER_19]: that want to push that out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what attracted me to Dragonfire
Medicine in the first place.
[SPEAKER_19]: I educate the people that are directly to
the consumers, could be able to help that
[SPEAKER_19]: until we figure out where we're at between
county and state even.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like Craig said, going to TPL,
you walk in the garden, you're able to see
[SPEAKER_10]: where things are growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so freaking important.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so cool to be able to offer something
like that too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an experience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the term,
[SPEAKER_12]: so we need to call each other when we're
doing really well and not be shy of that
[SPEAKER_12]: and feel how we can celebrate our
successes as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when it comes to a dollar,
I would much rather go to, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: a farmer's market or any type of pop-up
where people are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, get some sows and some
lotions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This last one I went to, I got this really
hand sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all natural and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheaper than what you get in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be anything, but I would rather
put my money in somebody's hands like that
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of the stuff, it is super
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting something better than what
you would see in your typical commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I don't like going into stores,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just weirds me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmer's markets and stuff, I'm crazy
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I got a question, normally I don't even
have to ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are willing to share their passion
or love and the information and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was living, if we were all literally
living around each other right now and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing different types of herbs
and you're growing fruits and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I'd be buying it up not just to eat,
but I make little ferments and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm trying to source good,
organically growing fruits and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: and making whole turk juice and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything else that surrounds it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tell you, if you need seeds or
anything, just holler at your boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, unfortunately, we don't all live
around each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we got this internet thing and
now I know that you didn't know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can still support one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need some seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you need something, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more than happy, like I said,
to donate it to you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money is whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of people out there that
buy them just for whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm more than happy to share with y
'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you ever need anything, just give me
a holler.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I say something?
[SPEAKER_18]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're almost like carrying the torch of
the Back to the Land movement.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we are carrying the torch of the
Back to the Land movement.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we talk a lot about landscaping as a
garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: We watch these French gardening shows.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the thing that people are transformed
by seeing these beautiful flower gardens
[SPEAKER_18]: and these estates.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're using this Back to the Land
movement values and regeneration as this
[SPEAKER_18]: transformational experience where people
come here and they come to Craig's farm
[SPEAKER_18]: and they see the mycelium growing in the
soil and they're like totally blown away.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're transformed.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a values war in the cannabis industry
at this point.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's deep, entrenched values.
[SPEAKER_18]: Heartful eco-gardening.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just saying it versus this
corporate paradigm that imposed these
[SPEAKER_18]: mechanical overlays on our life.
[SPEAKER_18]: And fuck that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And when people come visit us,
it should be real.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it should be emotional.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it should be designed from our heart.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the transformation I'm going
through.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_21]: How can we be beneficial organisms on
Mother Earth?
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like our connection to the land is
our message.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the land is an expression of where we
are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rio, could you share?
[SPEAKER_12]: You mentioned it's a values war.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rio actually took this huge community
leadership role maybe six years ago and
[SPEAKER_12]: actually performed a work study and came
up with some real data.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you share that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a snapshot of that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was trained in mediation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then my job in the local government
was developing industry clusters for
homes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I developed a whole process for my
trainings on how to get everybody to write
[SPEAKER_18]: out sticky notes of what their core values
are.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I got tables to come together
with what the table thought was the top
[SPEAKER_18]: 10.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we go and we put it up on a board
in front of the group and everybody voted
[SPEAKER_18]: on their core values.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we came up with the top 10 core
values.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think there's a lot of movement
right now to do it again and reassess
[SPEAKER_18]: like, hey, are we living our core values?
[SPEAKER_18]: How are we doing compared to what we were
10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_18]: And every 10 years, we could check in and
see if we have that integrity of are we
[SPEAKER_18]: living according to what we feel?
[SPEAKER_18]: And to me, that's happiness.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like when my core values are aligned,
I'm in harmony.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if I'm broken and off of my core,
then I'm stressed.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that's an important thing is to
reassess and stay core.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that was a beautiful process.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And every year I get better at living my
core values.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to bring in something I'm
just I'm just now learning.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just what you're talking about
resonates so deeply with this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anyone's like the
domination culture versus partnerism.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a have you heard of the partnerism
thing yet?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a beautiful practice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what a beautiful lens to because I get
caught in domination behavior all the
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to learn that conflict can be
redefined is when any two people get
[SPEAKER_11]: together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that literally everything we do is by
terms of agreement and also transparency.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if we have tensions with each other,
being able to sit in the moment and have
[SPEAKER_11]: this kind of reciprocity and like being
real people together.
[SPEAKER_11]: I I can't wait to practice that in my own
community and to have it with my neighbor
[SPEAKER_11]: finally and to have it with my dearest
mother who I don't hug often enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, anyway, I just love this
community building on this level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for bringing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what what we're recognizing is
that the structures that we were and have
[SPEAKER_14]: been living under and we have been looking
for reciprocity, we've been looking for,
[SPEAKER_14]: hey, we're out here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are now recognizing that not only do
they not speak our language, but they
[SPEAKER_14]: don't want to speak our language.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not interested in speaking our
language.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a pretend fraction of wanting to
speak our language so that we could come
[SPEAKER_14]: into, you know, their field of sight.
[SPEAKER_14]: So but the thing is that they don't
realize when they're dealing with
[SPEAKER_14]: regenerative farmers is that we've been
talking a lot about seeds and we are
[SPEAKER_14]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's that old line, you know,
when they try to bury us.
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: That works for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we can deal with that because what
you're doing is you're showing us how
[SPEAKER_14]: you're going to bury us and then we're
going to be figuring out as a group in our
[SPEAKER_14]: mycelial network where we're going to
repopulate and how we're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: repopulate.
[SPEAKER_14]: And everything that we're talking about
right now is the most basic, most
[SPEAKER_14]: important fraction of the entire vision.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's actually the hub of the wheel
and then all of the spokes go off of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like our happiness and our health and our
self-love comes from community.
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes from the people around us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that community is also on a microbial
level.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that microbial level is balanced soil
that we also come from.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are no different than that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we don't have a true running wheel,
which means that every single spoke off of
[SPEAKER_14]: it running true, you know, that cog is
definitely the soil and we're holding
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're talking about here is
something that you can start everywhere,
[SPEAKER_14]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter if you're in downtown.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get together a group of people to
say, hey, how can we get more beehives to
[SPEAKER_14]: top all of the, all of the different
buildings here?
[SPEAKER_14]: How can we get more farmers markets?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it that we can do to uplift the
frequency that is going to hear us because
[SPEAKER_14]: that standardized frequency, the
government no longer wants to hear us.
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually can't because of language is
frequency.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not words.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's frequency.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last two years, our frequency is
shifting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then they actually can no longer hear us
and we can no longer hear them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to go where the frequency is
the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's going to happen from us
recreating the soil and nature vibe as
[SPEAKER_14]: mentor and no longer humans being the
mentorship.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just commune around the true,
the true mentor, which is nature.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I went off on that ramp,
but I wanted to bring it together about
[SPEAKER_14]: all this potency that you all are talking
about here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And please add anyone jump in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our, and it is a back to the land
movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love that our land may be used for
tourism in some cases, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing people to our land, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe JJ's got so much water.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could plant 27 different Willow species
on the property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing you know, JJ's a basket weaver
making the most amazing baskets you've
[SPEAKER_08]: ever seen, you know, or, or living fences.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still working on that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: You put the canes in the ground and they
grow, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Crestone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Crestone right here and now,
just cause I can say yes to dope goats.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing too, like, don't be
afraid, like spread the good word,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, uplift your, your friends
and everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, any post I'm making on
IG, like anything I'm using to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody to ask me like what to use,
what to grow, you know, I'm not just like
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshitting because like, oh yeah,
they're friends of mine, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a problem telling a friend,
like if they're giving me something to
[SPEAKER_02]: use, it didn't work good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll tell them, you know,
I'm not, not shy about that, but take like
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Rizdin, you know, like he was asking
me, you know, how to, how to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: organically turned him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's grown a dragonfly and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's, he's doing it up up in Michigan
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, any people that he
talks to, like, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's contagious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you do good for other
people's and like I said, spread the good
[SPEAKER_02]: word, you know, and anytime you have time
to like share some weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: let them know how you grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uplift your, your friends and
your, you know, the people that are around
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs something, you know,
like where I'm from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, buddy, going to the
Jiffy Lube or whatever, like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a problem with your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a guy for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got a nice, you know,
something quality, like guys not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack you or whatever and you need some
fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a guy for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you need some moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a guy for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we can, we can still,
we can, we can still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do that same thing with what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might not all be in the same local
town, but you know, you got, you got a
[SPEAKER_02]: person for that, you know, and we,
you know, I guess I don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_02]: spread the good word, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That my silly, I'm reaching outward.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really love that all of us are connected
and then also sharing resources and things
[SPEAKER_10]: with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_10]: We, I love it at our farmer's market,
how we all trade a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: People come and get my products.
[SPEAKER_10]: I trade them for different awesome foods.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just, I love that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got many gifts that way of like being
able to get gifts for other family members
[SPEAKER_10]: just by like trading and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I love bartering and trading and
it's powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really want to touch on what you
said, Kelly, with the health and happiness
[SPEAKER_10]: and self-love and going back to it,
when you said about the, about the core
[SPEAKER_10]: values, all of that, it's like,
we all have our own core values.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like once we are aligned with
those core values, when we find what that
[SPEAKER_10]: is, and it's like then health,
happiness, self-love, all of that can
[SPEAKER_10]: happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now on this time, it just feels
like a lot, a lot of us are getting shook
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I feel for me, my whole world is like
kind of falling apart, but it's like
[SPEAKER_10]: falling back together.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all falling into place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I'm realigning and re-remembering
like my purpose.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like that's happening with a
lot of us because it's like so much
[SPEAKER_10]: bullshit happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, wait a minute, this isn't me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's realigning and finding those core
values again and going, okay, wait,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is what feels good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we are part of it and
reconnecting, getting out of the cities,
[SPEAKER_10]: getting out of the concrete, getting out
of the pollution and getting back to
[SPEAKER_10]: touching the soil, to seeing color therapy
with our eyes of the plants, to being able
[SPEAKER_10]: to walk in a garden, even touch a cannabis
plant, to touch a fruit tree and taste it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like that right there is like,
I feel like when true health and harmony
[SPEAKER_10]: and balance can start to happen and how
it's so important with growing your own
[SPEAKER_10]: food, growing your own medicine,
or sourcing it at a place that it's grown
[SPEAKER_10]: with love and loving.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like this is evolved humans is like we
heal us, we create, we evolve,
[SPEAKER_10]: we shift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we're doing telepathy soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully we'll be able to teleport to
each other soon, these beautiful things,
[SPEAKER_10]: but all that has to happen as we evolve.
[SPEAKER_10]: This like humanity, like we have to have
more pure thought, more, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: just things that can't be hidden.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I feel like we're in a good
sense, but it's realigning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like all of us really need to be
again.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's like recreating ourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just came up with something which is the
ego, the evolutionary mystical.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that, you know, we can move,
you know, keep those parts that we need,
[SPEAKER_14]: but often it is the evolutionary gateway
obstacle and what we've been taught in
[SPEAKER_14]: this standardized sort of lifestyle that
we've been living is always look to
[SPEAKER_14]: someone else for the answers and don't
share the answers with other people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep them to yourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything in school tells you don't
cheat, don't share, only get information
[SPEAKER_14]: from one person, which is the teacher.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of this is like getting our brain,
you know, used to something that is going
[SPEAKER_14]: to take us away from that self love and
that self happiness.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to mention too, you know,
as human beings, one of the things that
[SPEAKER_14]: we're always running away from is pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to talk about like every single
one of the people that you're seeing up
[SPEAKER_14]: here has either gone through tremendous
pain to be sitting here, whether they're
[SPEAKER_14]: their farm, or whether there's been
incarceration for what it is that they
[SPEAKER_14]: love and what they want to do,
but also, you know, having to dig up the
[SPEAKER_14]: money from eight years ago that you never
wanted to dig up or, or maybe having to
[SPEAKER_14]: risk your children to still get medicine
out into the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you look at this type of
community, we've come from a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, in the Dempure agreement,
we agreed to get through things that are
[SPEAKER_14]: difficult, because we want to delve into
what is difficult.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that if we don't deal with
difficulty, then we are not going to arise
[SPEAKER_14]: to, you know, reaching what we've always
been searching for.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like you've got to have the compost
that reeks before you can have the soil
[SPEAKER_14]: that you plant into.
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't be afraid, like right now is a
great day to compost yourself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, it's the it's okay that it's the
first day to come out and say,
[SPEAKER_14]: fuck, I need to reevaluate where I've come
from and start aligning with those values
[SPEAKER_14]: and that frequency that can hear me and
that can that can understand me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, another rant, but Isn't that what
we're here for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Rant and rave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I really love to be in that group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really opens my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a I think that only in the
midst of stress or difficulty,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are actually growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are too comfortable, but we have,
we just sitting there and be rotting,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, but the challenges that come
our life, and nothing is handed to us that
[SPEAKER_01]: we cannot handle, then we are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's so in some way,
it's sometimes hard to welcome the
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can shift our way to look at it,
say, okay, there is another thing that's
[SPEAKER_04]: been similar things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a lot of appreciation for you
because of, you know, coming from East
[SPEAKER_08]: Germany and seeing everything that you
have, seeing everything that you've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: in your life and the
[SPEAKER_08]: possible for people because a lot of
people talk about what they can and can't
[SPEAKER_08]: do or themselves being stuck and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know what everyone's going
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's stories like yours and other
people that have overcome things and
[SPEAKER_08]: become such an amazing beacon,
you know, in the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really love and appreciate you and those
words mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe before we end, you can help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you give us a little visualization
practice at the very end of this,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're out for that, we would be a love
to leave everybody just to leave us with a
[SPEAKER_08]: nice thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can think about that as we,
you know, start wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was somebody else that wanted to
say something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, you had a thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you if it still pertains.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyone else?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, Kelly, we've all been
through pain and having just been witness
[SPEAKER_09]: to childbirth again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's incredible pain here to birth life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, when my wife is coming on,
she goes, Oh, we can't do this again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the so deep because on the soul
level, we can't do this again.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to keep moving forward in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I love about spirituality and
physics is they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like in, you know, two points,
if you go from here to here, you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: going backwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's no going backwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only going forwards, but only if
we learn the lessons, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: because there is when you start to repeat
that progress, and you could say that's
[SPEAKER_09]: going backwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, there's no going
backwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see us moving forward, even from
what we've exchanged, or what was stolen,
[SPEAKER_09]: what we replace clean water and a healthy
forest for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's utterly, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go into like a supermarket,
like a gas station, go, it's all we traded
[SPEAKER_09]: this for clean water and a healthy forest.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like the rainbow prophecy,
the hope is, we are here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The rainbow children have grown older,
they've become rainbow mothers and rainbow
[SPEAKER_09]: fathers, rainbow grandmothers and
grandfathers, you know, home, we are here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have come to, you know,
but we find that here this time,
[SPEAKER_09]: we find the garden of Eden here,
but we're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we want to work, we might never
see those goals, we might never achieve
[SPEAKER_09]: those dreams, but we like to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're here in the garden, we're going
to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like to leave my little bit on one
of the new poem I sent it to you,
[SPEAKER_09]: Josh, and this is just a little
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Mover of Mountains.
[SPEAKER_09]: Never let anyone tell you you're not good
enough, that you can't do it, that you're
[SPEAKER_09]: never going to make it, that it is foolish
to follow your dreams.
[SPEAKER_09]: After all, you are an individualized drop
of the infinite spirit, a microcosmos that
[SPEAKER_09]: through the law of miracles contains the
very universe itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: The wave of the sea dissolves in the sea,
and there is no obstacle that can stop
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_09]: No storm, that can throw you off course.
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter how insurmountable it may seem,
in time you will find there is no peak too
[SPEAKER_09]: high, for you are a mover of mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, check him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a poem called All the Way that he
wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about overcoming, you know,
adversity and a lot of things that go
[SPEAKER_02]: along with like, you know, your goal,
like what you really want to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you want to do in life, like what
you're truly passionate about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd highly advise everybody to give that
one a read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super, super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, you know, there's
problems in life, but there's solutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you just got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's mistakes and then
there's successes and understanding why
[SPEAKER_02]: the mistake was a mistake and,
you know, rectifying that and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, improving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also understand why you were
successful, like not living and operating
[SPEAKER_02]: by half a stance, like understanding why,
you know, things are doing what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can, you know, become better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken starving, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sacrificing for what I do, but like that
poem says it, you know, but you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it because that's what you really
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you really love.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're really passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you might lose
relationships, friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: family, you know, husbands, wives,
whatever, but like, you're going to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make it through that shit
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually like, you know,
you're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get there, it's priceless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best thing, best thing a person
can have, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it just makes you better,
makes you a better person at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day and makes you stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when something pops up with
a friend and maybe you can help them out,
[SPEAKER_02]: have some input, you know, maybe going
through something similar, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: those that are around you, you can bring
them up to, you know, through experience
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything, maybe keep them from
making the same mistakes, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, growing knowledge or
business knowledge or life knowledge or
[SPEAKER_02]: turning a wrench or whatever, you know,
like just keep passing it on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can all be better for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for saying that, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of you, you know, it's been a rough
couple years in this world and I've had to
[SPEAKER_19]: make some serious decisions in the last
few months and other decisions being made
[SPEAKER_19]: for me and, you know, life.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've always said like, you know,
life doesn't really get any easier.
[SPEAKER_19]: We just get better at it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try to understand the little cues and the
messages and, you know, once I kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: surrendered, you know, all these
opportunities came up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: Joanne Tamara asked me to come on out
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was about to go, you know, do some
farming out in Oklahoma and I was going to
[SPEAKER_19]: work with this really cool lady that
actually she got in a car wreck when she
[SPEAKER_19]: was 16.
[SPEAKER_19]: She lost her eyesight and some other
things happened to her and she came to,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, a place of healing through
cannabis and it really changed her life.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she wanted to, you know, change the
world with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And my client people wanted to help her
grow regeneratively and polycropping and
[SPEAKER_19]: all kinds of other medicines for finished
products.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she had some really good shops and she
got taken advantage of by some people out
[SPEAKER_19]: there and it crushed her business.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, you know, she was a really
nice person and, you know, vulnerable,
[SPEAKER_19]: but she could have done some really
amazing things.
[SPEAKER_19]: But at the same time, you know,
it's hard for me to move away from Cali,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, because this is where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my home.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my stomping grounds all over
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love this place, you know, and the
spirit and the culture and the people that
[SPEAKER_19]: I've met here, people I know here.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a really unique place.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's changed my life.
[SPEAKER_19]: But to be able to kind of let go after so
much that's gone on over the last year and
[SPEAKER_19]: then be able to come here and be able to
realize that now I get to kind of go back
[SPEAKER_19]: to my source and grow cannabis because I
love it, you know, as like a personal
[SPEAKER_19]: plant and work with all different types of
other medicines.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm working with Mario from Cosmic
Forest Farms is helping to build a house
[SPEAKER_19]: for his new sheep that he's bringing in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I set up this whole silvo pasture set
up and, you know, for rotational grazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just all these beautiful things
that I, you know, I love so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, you know, I dedicate so much time
and knowing that I haven't had as much
[SPEAKER_19]: time as I wanted last numerous years
because I've been distracted by things
[SPEAKER_19]: that don't need to be as important.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind of took away a long time from the
point that I started doing this in the
[SPEAKER_19]: first place.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel like there's beauty in the
chaos.
[SPEAKER_19]: And every day I'm still learning more.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to be more perceptive of my
surrounding environment, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: and really listen to the messages and the
lessons.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I appreciate all you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: For what you shared today, it's,
you know, been noteworthy and mentionable.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would love to maybe it's to get you
around 12 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure if Marcus is here back
yet, but he had to go away for a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit, but maybe we could talk one more
thing about what you're most excited about
[SPEAKER_08]: on your farm from this last winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say from our perspective,
we did a really good job of mulching
[SPEAKER_08]: everything last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't have the opportunity to grow
crops in the winter because it's freezing
[SPEAKER_08]: and tons of snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had an extra amount of snow this
winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to really focus on mulching.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we say mulch love.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is mulch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Without mulch in the dream, it'll never
come true.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we're fancy, we like to say
mulche just cause that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we like to call mulch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a bone mulche.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, we're peeling the gardens
covered in mulch right now, like a
[SPEAKER_08]: blanket.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now I'm just sort of using my hands
and ripping the mulch back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just filled.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's just moving all over and it's
like matted down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's it's matting like plastic wood,
matting weeds down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're just planting new.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just take a little pickax and I just
kind of pick like a Pulaski or a Hodad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just pick that line and just kind of
fluff up the soil a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take my hand, go like that and put seeds
on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just cover it back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of the garden stays mulched.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just have these little babies
coming up and everywhere around us is
[SPEAKER_08]: covered and everything's wet right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole entire earth is just just
everywhere you walk.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wet because of the snow melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really excited looking at the
health of the soil right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some cases, we left the greenhouse
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tina was talking about how hard it is to
grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's extremely difficult to grow here in
the Kootenays of British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we get early frost and crazy
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we use greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we dug walley peenies and
things into the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have pipes going into the ground
six feet for like warm air coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we do have the ability for passive
growth, but we still don't choose lights
[SPEAKER_08]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just go for passive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, as soon as the snow melts,
even though it's freezing, it's time for
[SPEAKER_08]: us to plant our seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really excited right now seeing the
health and the crazy life in our soil and
[SPEAKER_08]: the thing that we've gone beyond making a
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, all of the aisles and all of the
gardens are the compost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any food scraps you can bury in the garden
or feed to the chickens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any limbs off the trees get put in the
aisles, any leaves, everything,
[SPEAKER_08]: the aisles.
[SPEAKER_08]: By this time, I'm looking at my aisles
from last year, and it's an incredible
[SPEAKER_08]: wealth of soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now just if I want, I can just fold
that aisle over onto the onto the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that's what an IMO is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my indigenous microorganisms to
grow in the garden from local materials,
[SPEAKER_08]: because that's what indigenous
microorganisms are.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to tell you guys, I actually
heard you talking about this years,
[SPEAKER_19]: years and years ago, and I modeled the
last Google bed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was 2,500 square feet of,
you know, three foot deep and just,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, like a really nice lasagna tech.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was so lush, most lush garden I ever
grew.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that model of, you know,
that static compost in the aisles and just
[SPEAKER_19]: keep on taking all that brush and that
overgrowth and piling it in there and
[SPEAKER_19]: stomping it down.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the mushrooms in the life that we'd
get out of that space would just explode,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was so, so beautiful to see that
garden evolve off of, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: a lot of your guys' teachings.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the IMO right there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the easy farm, you know,
work that you don't have to go out and
[SPEAKER_10]: capture anything or add sugar to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see the biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the deep mulching so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you have that, you can still get
those organisms from that other
[SPEAKER_08]: environment and you may liquefy it and put
it all over all the mulch or you pack it
[SPEAKER_08]: in and just know it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're always seeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly bringing white rice and
collecting things that grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: IMOs can easily come from your IMOs,
which is your indigenous microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_14]: which maybe, you know, you can see back
behind tomorrow, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: in your farm there, underneath some of
those trees and in some of those zones are
[SPEAKER_14]: going to be growing like pristine plants
or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you would pick that little zone
or that little area of, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: a little tiny handful of soil and then
that's an IMO for a billion, trillion
[SPEAKER_14]: times more.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just, yeah, just makes a lot more
sense.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fastest little feller was with Che
and maybe, oh, Brian, did you want to say
[SPEAKER_08]: something?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was going to say that's
interesting because what I found on this
[SPEAKER_16]: land after it was post-weir cut,
we came in and it kind of helped us to be
[SPEAKER_16]: that, but it was really messy.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I pushed like over a mile of
trails with help last year on the
[SPEAKER_16]: property.
[SPEAKER_16]: And even from the trails off the original
clear cut, the skitter trails,
[SPEAKER_16]: there was a lot of deposited humus that
was turned over, ancient humus,
[SPEAKER_16]: and it opened it up to exposure to the
sun.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was drying out in portions,
but I've been able to isolate pockets that
[SPEAKER_16]: are kind of getting worked, but they're
still fresh.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I reintroduced like leaf litter
and other, you know, microorganism based
[SPEAKER_16]: natural litter and kind of try to restore
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Naturally with fluffing it up more and
letting it grow.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've been able to pull a natural
forest humus out locally here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've shifted out of any type of
purchase bounty or any ancient humus
[SPEAKER_16]: that's in a bag all the way from Alaska or
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're actually like implementing that
forest humus of ours into the compost tea
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're growing our mycelium flats from
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And really just having a great,
great, turn off it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Shay, what were you, are you doing any
new tech on the land this year?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I knew you have an area of forest that
that's been cleared and you're
[SPEAKER_08]: re-inoculating and reworking things.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the things you're going
to be doing this year?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we do hemp up here too.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to have some high quality hemp,
but really I think the bigger benefit is
[SPEAKER_15]: actually like preparing the land,
improving the land.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we just harvest the main coal and then
chop and drop it back in and spread in
[SPEAKER_15]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the first year that we won't have
to till.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's a dirty word.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that I don't want to do,
but we actually ended up on basically a
[SPEAKER_15]: glacial till and sand for our subsoil
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a couple inches of soil or forest
fines maybe that we stripped off the top,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's been hard to get the soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we've been turning back in organic
matter, a lot of clover and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're finally at the point now where
we don't have to till anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a lasagna tech from here
forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, really thick gild or living mulch
support species last year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it was nice to see the spring.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this heavy mat and the snow has
laid it all nice and down flat.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's decomposing super quickly because we
are pretty heavy on the microbes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's great to see the soil really
coming around.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gone from sand to like this black
loamy crumb to what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the biggest thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_15]: The most exciting thing of all is to have
the best soil possible, because it all
[SPEAKER_15]: comes from that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And JJ, what about you?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's like really, especially on my
spot, there's major drainage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, my main focus has been and
will continue to be bringing organic
[SPEAKER_07]: material.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just like anything that I can
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've just set up a couple of gray
water systems with comfrey planted so I
[SPEAKER_07]: can like get the nitrogen from my sink for
that specific project.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I need to get animals on
the property still.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some chickens, but my chickens set
up through the harsh winter wasn't really
[SPEAKER_07]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had some deaths that in that
department.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, like, you know, my focus is
definitely going to be on organic
[SPEAKER_07]: material, either sourcing it from
neighbors or, you know, finding a way to
[SPEAKER_07]: either grow more things like alfalfa and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: On down the line, Craig, how about you?
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a spectacular garden last year,
a field of giant plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: looked like a field, you know,
but still it was just, and I love the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that you use the straw bales and
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year was our first year of scaling
the farm down again by another 7,000
[SPEAKER_12]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're down to like 10,000, like I said
earlier, and that was exponential
[SPEAKER_12]: difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we grew 10 different cultivars,
nine are on a menu at a local shop,
[SPEAKER_12]: and the 10th is waiting to be released as
our next farm cured extraction,
[SPEAKER_12]: extracted rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: So getting smaller was really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_12]: But to answer your specifically,
Josh, we took our cover cropping to like
[SPEAKER_12]: the next level.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to consider our cover crop or
off-season crop as the main goal of the
[SPEAKER_12]: farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, during the winter time here in
Humboldt County, we get a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_12]: We get really nice growing temperatures
for greens, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're growing, you know, fava,
bell, vetch, these types of plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we made due diligence at the end of
harvest last year to get in immediately.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we grew out probably one of the best
cover crops we've ever produced.
[SPEAKER_12]: And going into a drought season,
we feel the most beneficial thing we could
[SPEAKER_12]: do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dr. Elaine Ingham was just here about
the end of January and she really spoke to
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: She gave a whole presentation about
organic material in your soil and organic
[SPEAKER_12]: matter will really help with water
preservation.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that was kind of like one of the
models you keep hearing me talk about
[SPEAKER_12]: through the whole process was not what are
we doing to make more money?
[SPEAKER_12]: How are we saving the money?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how are we saving the water?
[SPEAKER_12]: How are we saving the resource?
[SPEAKER_12]: How are we working with our own farm and
our own way of keeping that all here,
[SPEAKER_12]: whether it's the water and we're really
blessed to have the agriculture we have in
[SPEAKER_12]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of look at closing my loops
within the county.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got an ocean.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the farmlands.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were working with an organic dairy to
get their compost, not even their compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's their raw manure.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're able to get loads of this amazing
alfalfa now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our goal one day would probably be to
close the loops like within our little
[SPEAKER_12]: region of, you know, us and Rio and Lady
Sativa.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the moment, we're working within
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_12]: We mentioned Mushroom Mike at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's growing and seeding spawn of mushroom
into the native Tanooks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then those Tanooks are producing the
mushroom to go to culinary and farmers
[SPEAKER_12]: markets, mushrooms and medicinal rishis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then all those mushroom blocks are
coming back to the farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're constantly taking these forest
products and ocean products and just
[SPEAKER_12]: moving them around the county and kind of
doing what the salmon and the bear and the
[SPEAKER_12]: rivers did.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the moment, we're using a little
bit of, you know, fuels, but we're trying
[SPEAKER_12]: to be as efficient as we can to move those
products around and kind of keep that loop
[SPEAKER_12]: closed within our county.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it's like all this knowledge
share is like so important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate everybody, you know,
so many of the things we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_12]: whether it's the genetics or specific tip.
[SPEAKER_12]: The biggest tip I would probably share
with everyone is one of our ways of
[SPEAKER_12]: terminating our cover crop is we call it
skier grown tech.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I pull out these old skis that I have
and I literally sidestep my cover crop
[SPEAKER_12]: down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And some people say, well, why don't
[SPEAKER_12]: you terminate all my cover crop?
[SPEAKER_12]: So having that time for the beneficials
and all my insects to move around is super
[SPEAKER_12]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say, yeah, take a moment and
think of other ways to terminate your
[SPEAKER_12]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if you have a bigger farm,
sometimes just back dragging the loader
[SPEAKER_12]: bucket of your tractor.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have that big of a farm where you
don't have the human capacity to do that,
[SPEAKER_12]: but just get away from tilling as best you
can and no judgment.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, every everybody takes their own
process to get to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in smart pots for the first couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_12]: We tried taking smart pots to the next
level cardboard lined cover crops,
[SPEAKER_12]: potatoes, all that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, you know, we just dump
those out onto rows of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone along the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate that Craig so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love that skier grown tech where you
just take your skis and push it over.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to say that that can be
done on a thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like rolling and crimping is
what they call it on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just taking a tractor and putting
a big barrel in front of it and just
[SPEAKER_08]: running the tractor over the crop and just
pushing it over.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like what no till looks like on
a thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a disc that goes behind
it and just splits the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you plant in that spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's nice to know that something
that's so it seems like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: grassroots farm level can be as also tech
for, you know, saving the whole entire
[SPEAKER_08]: world, thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Josh, I'm going to drop just one
little bit of information that we've been
[SPEAKER_12]: doing to.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is that we brought a trench
around to to trench in some some piping
[SPEAKER_12]: and some some electrical lines.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I was
[SPEAKER_12]: push up anywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always remember where everything is.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then I took it to the next level and I
started trenching like the floor of my
[SPEAKER_12]: greenhouse and my pathways and filling it
all with wood chips and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: compost and building all these biological
batteries within my property and all these
[SPEAKER_12]: sinks of biology.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just always think about like when
you're doing one task, how you can overlap
[SPEAKER_12]: those systems.
[SPEAKER_12]: And and when you're going to put soil back
in the earth covering something up,
[SPEAKER_12]: what could you put back in its place as
well to to buffer?
[SPEAKER_08]: So good, so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess on down the line, maybe Babri Best
Friend Farms will go up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm seeing on my screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go, Bri, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: New or DMPR farmer, you've gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're transforming a clear cut.
You.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did about we know that you're doing a
lot of new stuff and huge ups to all the
[SPEAKER_08]: main farmers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was saying I'm like really proud of
how people are doing it here in Maine.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been able to stay medical kind of
stubbornly, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: by choice.
[SPEAKER_16]: So and we're approaching it like a small
craft and small batch mentality,
[SPEAKER_16]: which Maine kind of is anyway.
[SPEAKER_16]: So really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm excited about always about
compost.
[SPEAKER_16]: And after we're here for our fifth year,
it's finally starting to get to the point
[SPEAKER_16]: where it's got such a good continuum and
the biomass that just comes from that,
[SPEAKER_16]: even the smaller scale hemp and cannabis
is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like between like the carbon and
nitrogen ratio and and local cultures or
[SPEAKER_16]: spores that are within back to it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we got a great continuum for rebuffing
the soil.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that that would be probably
the easiest thing to share, maybe,
[SPEAKER_16]: or that I don't know a lot of in depth
anyway, scientific based info.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know that we can all on any scale
compost back in the cities in the country
[SPEAKER_16]: and really make our own compost just from
the circular continuum of the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_16]: the hemp almost entirely.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're introducing good like local
fruit bodies.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a great mushroom year.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we went out and collected stuff that
was like dying back.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got, you know, multiple different
spores to add in that seems to be popping
[SPEAKER_16]: up fruit bodies even into the organic
indoor.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's it's working there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would say that I'm actually really
excited to learn so much today and thank
[SPEAKER_16]: all you guys for, you know, paying it back
to Mother Earth because it's definitely
[SPEAKER_16]: it's needed.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's it's man or humans rather have kind
of scarred the earth in a way that has
[SPEAKER_16]: allowed us to live here in subside.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it just feels like the most important
task that we're all taking pretty
[SPEAKER_16]: seriously and rejuvenating the earth where
we've, you know, cleared to live to have
[SPEAKER_16]: animals to farm.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the regenerative mission just seems so
needed more than ever right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm super happy to be part of it and
learn from all you guys today.
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say that thank you, Josh and
Kelly, like totally answered a question or
[SPEAKER_16]: not question, but like I had motivation to
fill my aisles after we correct our hemp
[SPEAKER_16]: field more this year for our raised beds
and getting it to the no till point.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to just fill up the aisles
with the with the local biomass and,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, scraps and the wood from the
clean out of the stuff that's already down
[SPEAKER_16]: and rotting.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're really going to try to just make
it not as much of the, I guess,
[SPEAKER_16]: aisle idea.
[SPEAKER_16]: With it or a rose, maybe as much as it is
building.
[SPEAKER_14]: So incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one last thing that I wanted to say
before we and Duke, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sort of had a feeling that you may know
that Kukowski poem by heart.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that's something that you wanted to
recite and then we could end with
[SPEAKER_14]: Alexandra and a thought, that would be
really awesome because I'm feeling that
[SPEAKER_14]: from you, that you know that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have I have a vibe on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But one thing I want to just say and
leaving with everybody is the word legacy.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been talking about it a lot tonight
and like this idea of like legacy and like
[SPEAKER_14]: leaving a legacy and you don't leave a
legacy with things and stuff you live.
[SPEAKER_14]: You leave a legacy with heart and soul.
[SPEAKER_14]: You leave a legacy with fruit trees and
beautiful soil so that your children have
[SPEAKER_14]: your seeds that they can just go out and
put them in the ground so that they can be
[SPEAKER_14]: taken care of.
[SPEAKER_14]: You leave a legacy by supporting other
people who are leaving that same kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, the reevaluation of what
that word is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one thing I just really quickly like
to say is I'd like to just give thanks to
[SPEAKER_08]: the birth of our granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like to say as a legacy,
Kelly, as a midwife in our home,
[SPEAKER_08]: on the land, on our own terms,
having our children at home, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: these are the legacies.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is the this is nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is evolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is regeneration.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's powerful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel really grateful and
thankful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Giving the opportunity for the ultimate
optimal outcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we're all doing here is
we're giving opportunity for the ultimate
[SPEAKER_14]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just appreciate you all so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to hand it over to Duke
because I I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too afraid to recite it off the
mend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like running risk of butchering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to have like some angry
poet society hunt me down and beat me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely I'll just read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charles Bukowski, go all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to try, go all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, don't even start.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, or maybe even your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could mean not eating for three or four
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could mean freezing on a park bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could mean jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could mean derision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could mean mockery, isolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But isolation is the gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: All others are just a test of your
endurance and how much you really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll do it despite the rejection and
the worst odds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be better than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to try, go all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no other feeling like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be aligned with the gods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nights will flame with fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will ride life straight to perfect
laughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only good fight there is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give thanks to everyone out in
the world watching us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take this and make the world a better
place in your in your in your world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go do something good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And last thoughts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big thanks to Marcus for continuing to
hold this space.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not be learning how to make rosin
right now for the first time, but we are
[SPEAKER_08]: feeling each other on a way that we have
never felt before.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which makes better rosin in the end.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's connect it all.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a better hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Alexandra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to first of all acknowledge the
mouth itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to acknowledge the land that you
are all residing on with your physical
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are here on the circle and
the ones that are watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to acknowledge the people of that
land that have walked and lived there long
[SPEAKER_01]: before we came.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to acknowledge you here present and
your ancestors that have passed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: life to you as you have passed on life to
your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I acknowledge life in the macro as much in
the micro life that we are seeing and life
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are not seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to acknowledge the uniqueness of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes through all of you in such a
beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our heart space, we shall connect
to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall accept the light of the earth in
our heart and the light of the cosmic
[SPEAKER_04]: heart to be married with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victim and victimizer the same so that we
can connect and they can remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: light and the love that exists in our
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they can remember that they shall
follow this light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love you all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love you all who are watching.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody, thank you all so much for
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never too late.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_18]: Much love to the garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck.
