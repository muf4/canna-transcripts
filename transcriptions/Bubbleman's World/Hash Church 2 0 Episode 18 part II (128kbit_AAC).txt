[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, sorry about that, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got bounced off the air, all sorts of
technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a strange, strange thing
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bumming out about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly or Debbie, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I go out again and I come back
in, I'll be able to hear you, but we'll go
[SPEAKER_02]: offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe hashtag's getting the best of me
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might not be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep trying for a little bit,
but... Maybe Google's going away today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if we get bounced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, Market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, was it a slinger marble show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get Sheila back here in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheila would know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, are we offline now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you perfect, but I wonder how
long we'll stay live for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still see the live in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for... You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: After 220 of these, I have to say,
if this was a year or two ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been having a harsh reality
right now, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Bubble Man, I have a question quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, the Google goes away,
April 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we still going to be able to use this
format?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly have no idea what's going to be
happening, but I will figure something out
[SPEAKER_02]: that we will be able to do what we're
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether that happens through Google or
some other option, I will make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been making me a little nervous,
too, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be why things are a little wonky
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Yeah, there's no support.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I got on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it may have been the last time
in this type of format.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I wanted to make sure to get on at
least to give my love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, Cali?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is too crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a simple mute, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a simple mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other times, you got to go into the little
cog and you got to check what you have set
[SPEAKER_02]: up for your microphone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the left-hand side, there's a control
room section.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're having problems,
check under your control room and make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you have the right microphone,
because sometimes you also have to go into
[SPEAKER_03]: your systems and check your headphones and
microphone output if you're using a
[SPEAKER_03]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we still got a couple hundred people
back in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're laughing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, what a gong show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's gong show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's just blowing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only a nine-minute video in the
old one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we get the happy birthday in before it
crashed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thank you for the ice cream
cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get him a Whaley?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sam was unable to make Legends
of Hash this year, which we threw down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I missed that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shirt on right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, because Sam missed it,
we made sure we got him some T-shirts and
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the card for him, the invitation,
and all of the samples from Legends so he
[SPEAKER_02]: could kind of be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say welcome earlier,
but all of a sudden, we weren't live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys are muted, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear them, too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Marcus is having technical issues for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can hear certain of us and some of us
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, apparently, Dragonfly, unfortunately,
you're in Collin's boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear Collin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I can hear any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear us, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear you, Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hear Dragonfly at all either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why it would let me
hear some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collin is having the same problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can hear certain people, but not other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has got to be a phase out of their
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear Debbie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Debbie can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can also hear Hans Perlequin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly, can you say something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can hear everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mike, say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check, check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I got Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear absolutely everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost not hear anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll open my laptop and I'll watch
it a little delayed on my laptop and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: hear everything that way and I can still
be a part of a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys, by all means, speak away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, there's not much happening in
cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I the only English person here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you are, technically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably the only English person
here currently.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in England right now with
the whole Brexit and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I knew, I'd be able to tell you.
