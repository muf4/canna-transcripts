[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc Atomic is back in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super good to see you again, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, that was a great video or a couple
of videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spliced it into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spliced it into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're there for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I had blown through at least three
hours of your time on that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you stayed for probably close to
three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was like 20 minutes.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what have you been up to since last
week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I brought a few gifts for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gifts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gifts from the doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you people out there in Gangela
and Raleigh know, I've been associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite, one of the,
there's many Thanos, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: generation to generation, cousins,
sisters, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one is very interesting in
the fact that it has a classic Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: finish to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you'd expect it to smell skunky,
but it smells super lemon, super citrus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a recessive gene from its sativa
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what you've got is a short Afghani
type, Afghani plant, fairly quick
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, eight to nine weeks,
beautiful lemon aroma, incredible high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming in from both the recessive sativa
genes, I'm suspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dominant Afghani genes, which is
showing in the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for the people that don't really
know, because I'm sure you've got your
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, but the Northern Lights,
and Doc mentioned it last time a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit in the video, I believe, that it's
this classic Afghani that they then bred
[SPEAKER_02]: into all these exotic sativas that were
coming in, probably Colombians.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambodians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard to nail down exactly
which sativas they were, since this
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were keeping bag seed from
these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the same sativas, actually,
that became named Hayes by the Hayes
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers back in the late 60s,
early 70s in San Francisco and Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys were collecting all these
incredible sativas as well, from Central
[SPEAKER_02]: and South and Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were basically, those were the
original Hayes' wasn't really any one
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just these amazing, exotic,
long flowering, tropical sativa-grown
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, back there, what we used to get
from Afghanistan was strictly the hashish,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was, of course, because of
smuggling, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only when the indoor grow thing came
into vogue in the late 70s, early 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers back then, they began to
discover the merits of the high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium halide lighting, which,
of course, was made for stadium lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and lighting streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, actually, probably quite a few
years later, but I guess it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been in the 80s when people I knew would
go and jack a light bulb from the ski hill
[SPEAKER_02]: and then grow a crop in their closet or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, of course, we began to develop
specialized bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that comes to mind right away is the
Hortilux bulb, which was originally made
[SPEAKER_00]: by Iwasaki in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they added more blue to the spectrum
because the regular high pressure sodiums
[SPEAKER_00]: caused the plants to elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, without enough blue in the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of companies that are
starting to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tweak the spectrum, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've noticed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to, I think his name was Alan,
one of the owners of Solistec.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were talking about doing these
chips that were like 2K and 5K and 10K.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're measured in Kelvin now,
which is something different for LED
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing these full spectrum LED
hoods that have all these different chips
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and create this full spectrum of
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's all sorts of arguments
online, which why bother having the yellow
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum or why bother having this
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tend to believe that the sun got it
right and that everything the sun has we
[SPEAKER_02]: might want in our artificial light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that potential synergies are occurring
on levels that we ourselves can't perceive
[SPEAKER_02]: or even our scientific instruments can't
perceive them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've heard, I know people that are
now using LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very effective, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quite expensive still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one on the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one on the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'll make a point on putting
potentially one of these Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_02]: under there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can try some of your strain grown
under an LED light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to sample any real product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor have I.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor have I.
[SPEAKER_00]: With LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen a friend of mine online,
Kingston Herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posts quality every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been growing with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been showing beautiful buds under
the pink light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been extracting the resonance,
melty and bubbly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was really the one that put me in
the belief that this could be something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I should try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was also the one that hooked me up
with Lush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sent me a light just for review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be going into the tent
that John Berfello is actually on his way
[SPEAKER_02]: here with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my second 8x4 secret Jardin tent
on the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, within a day or two from
that, that LED light will come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll literally be able to put my next
batch, which is Congo, Sweet Skunk,
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb, and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's going in the tent next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had another little special
something there as well as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular strain is called Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this comes from a breeder called
Reefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some of you up there must be...
Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what you want about Reefer Man,
but he always has the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'll say about Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give you a thumbs up, Charles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people that he created that
got stuff from him and then renamed and
[SPEAKER_00]: called it theirs and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This won't be getting renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will hold the Reefer Man name of
Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here from the doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Reefer Man as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Charles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Charles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll definitely share this with all the
right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you're going to get full
credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the doc will get full credit for
his NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to change names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell you the background to this
is an OG Kush crossed to a lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush crossed with a lemon tie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the most incredible aroma of any
plant I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfume on it is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotic, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very potent as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I offer you a little rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little medicine for your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice to be sharing good genetics with
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow I go see Remo and I'm going to be
doing some macro photography over with
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll probably film a video as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better get you over there one of these
days, doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we've met Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys would get along.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Bubble Man's world is all
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting the interesting characters of the
Kana community, bringing them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbing with the doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on in the world of
breeding with the doc?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're always never stopping,
even though you're probably trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomplicate your life and relax a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've still got things in the plans,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to focus down on just,
right now I have five strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never figure out people that have
50 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be big teams of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, or they're not all they say
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's maybe a little bit more
likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know it's involved and it's
quite involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every single fennel or,
to put it in plain English, individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, let's say we're choosing
from a number, from a gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing out as many plants as we
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to take cuttings from them
that correspond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only know, four to six months later,
what we really have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have the facility to go back
to that clone that was the chosen one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go forward from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see... The importance of
labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ability to maintain those labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had, just last year,
my helper mixed up some labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although I'm pretty good at telling
what's what, it upset me to no end that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to spend a couple of months just to
verify what was what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of two particular fennel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to turn that fan off real
quick because it'll drive me nuts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep talking.
There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mainly been in northern lights man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the most versatile
indoor strains around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's synonymous with your name to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Doc Atomic, the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's because I've had it so long and
I've tried my best to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that it has been washed out a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to slag anybody or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just through my own personal
selection, I've found that I've tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it as close to its short flowering,
super potent, very high yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the taste changed much over the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still that citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when I think sativa, I think
citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the Congo and the Sweet Stunk
strongly have the strong lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I find about the Sweet
Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemonine Turfine is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a bubble gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds more like the Island Sweet
Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have the Island Sweet Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows bigger nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Sweet Stunk on like
steroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see the one I gave you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it big, but it'll be more
larfy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, here's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a phenyl of the so-called Sweet
Stunk.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark has and other people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they're the same, but maybe
they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the way we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have three of them in the
same room all bloomed out together to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this process takes months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, just being left with the
herb, in my opinion, isn't an accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd want to then extract resin off of
each one, small amounts, and then do your
[SPEAKER_02]: de-nail dab and literally be like,
okay, I can just tell you from the taste
[SPEAKER_02]: which one is Steve's Sweet Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve's Sweet Stunk, unfortunately,
was kind of in the same group as the
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was protected and then it was shared
very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really had to be someone to be able to
get your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I think once more people have it,
or sorry, let me go back, the reason that
[SPEAKER_02]: it was held back like that, that made it
so the island Sweet Stunk came to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was Jordan or if it was
Cash Crop Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who did the Sweet Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very nice strain, but it isn't the
Sweet Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any person that has the Sweet Stunk that
you show the island Sweet Stunk to,
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks great to anyone that doesn't know
Sweet Stunk, but someone that knows Sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: Stunk will look at it and go, oh,
it's got it, it's there, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I always sort of explained it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had something, that sweet lemony kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the stature of the planet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it especially a tall plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it stretched long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can see my Sweet Stunk out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how stretched it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the tallest plant out there and it's
just super stretched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just turn that off real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it stretches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the island Sweet Stunk, I've never
personally grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it budding and it was also
fairly tall and lanky, but maybe some of
[SPEAKER_02]: our viewers out there can comment on the
island Sweet Stunk, because I know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that's more available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Matt from The Great Gardener
self-breeders Steve's Sweet Stunk and that
[SPEAKER_02]: is available through the Vancouver Seed
Bank, the same place that you can pick up
[SPEAKER_02]: the dock seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both The Great Gardener and the docks so
potentially, I believe both of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusive to Rebecca at the Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I exclusively sell them now because the
internet is rife with... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you open yourself up to some real
potential fraud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, outright.
[SPEAKER_02]: People selling hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, are people lifting pictures and
information and calling them something
[SPEAKER_00]: else?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, it's why nowadays it's
important to have that official YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: page and that official Facebook page,
because you have a porthole for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to find you in little
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're concentrated right to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how you let them know that you're
you is by going and doing a short little
[SPEAKER_02]: video and saying, look, I just made these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dropping them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this many.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll let you know when they sell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can control the people out there
that are trying to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: dishonest, completely fraudulent.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, and selling and seeds that they
don't even have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyways, being an underground guy
for all these years, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just learned from Mark about the
latest, the latest and the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all this Facebook YouTube
and verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that we're legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason we were underground is
because they made us criminals without
[SPEAKER_02]: that criminal element, without,
you know, with the license on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a completely different person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm allowed to be more honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm allowed to help and share and educate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, I'm allowed to
connect and learn because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people out there that are inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, all of that energy was
sucked up and being paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that car door?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the fuel for why is that carbon
parked down there so long?
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove by four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's that guy taking pictures?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I was visiting a friend in
Portland one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think we had it bad, our poor
American brethren down south, you guys got
[SPEAKER_02]: it good now, some of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wow, I'd say 15 years ago,
I was down in Portland for a fish show and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was visiting my friend and it was on
Hawthorne Street right by the Safeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was in those apartments right
across the street from the Safeway on
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawthorne.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hawthorne is kind of like the hippie
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera's son has a hemp store there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a couple of head shops and
glass shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're just puffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a shitty little glass spoon and
we're just puffing some herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess a cop pulls someone over
outside in front of his house and he just
[SPEAKER_02]: loses it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, running around his house,
collecting everything, flushing shit down
[SPEAKER_02]: the toilet, like completely believing that
the cops are here to come and get us and
[SPEAKER_02]: our little amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird to feel that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I felt it before in India when my
room was getting searched by the army.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had like a quarter pound of chars
from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, this will be 10
years if I get caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be like three months before I
have hep C and some other crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 10 years in an Indian prison,
not good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I flashed back to a story of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back in the smuggling days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had these two huge pair of boots
that were custom made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilo boots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, they were kilo and a half
boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the finest hand rubbed creme de la
creme champagne, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Northern India, like Himachal
Pradesh?
[SPEAKER_02]: From Manali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Manali creme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Famous valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm flying out of Delhi expecting to
get a flight directly to London and then
[SPEAKER_00]: back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to the airport, I was informed
because of equipment or some such changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would have to be changing planes in
Beirut, Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, unbeknownst to me at the very last
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is back in the 70s and there was
a lot of shit going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it was the beginning of
terrorism and hijacking and all that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never forget, because we had to
get out of the plane and we had to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: and change planes and we had to walk
through a new metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was walking through this metal
detector and the sound of these boots
[SPEAKER_00]: going over, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guard was looking straight at my
boots with his AK-47 and his bullet thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking straight at my boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, as we used to
say in the 60s and 70s when we were high,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked the other way and I went,
sat down, waited for that flight to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the moment we lifted off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us an idea now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your worry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in India, for me, my worry was 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing 10 years if they find this.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was your worry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a death penalty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it life in prison?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it 10, you know, what was the
realistic worry in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my business I was conducting in
Nepal and I had connections and I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone to jail there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In where?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, but in your fear of Beirut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Beirut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land in Beirut where you just told the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the fear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it death?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it life in prison?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what flashed back to me was Billy
Hayes in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are on Midnight
Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midnight Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the exact same situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I pictured as you were telling
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have to get off the plane and
he's got all the hash wrapped around him
[SPEAKER_02]: and they think it's a bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wasn't quite as greedy as Billy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it in my boots and it was quite a...
Billy had a rough go.
[SPEAKER_00]: ...stitching him in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this pure Manali cream was
only 1200 bucks a pound in Montreal in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of where the
prices had gone in this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I would be back Montreal and
have three or four or five grand or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was in a small time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then you could fly back to India
for like 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And live in places like Thailand well for
a couple of bucks a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that financed my Asia junkie holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's what the 70s was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ko Senwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ko Senwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jumbla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kerala, South India.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far is that from Goa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's down the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good... Ten hours or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: India is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least a thousand miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge for those of you that have never
driven across India.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a monstrous country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove into the north from Delhi up into
Haridwar, which is just near Rishikesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: By no means is it up, up, up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still took a long bloody time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get there and you're just in the
foothills of the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not even... You know, it's like,
listen man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, India is such a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's completely, it's another
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just interject another funny little
story.
Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what has anything to do with
it, but I landed at Delhi at three in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like 120 degrees and 98%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I wanted to do was go and crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crash out in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, well,
I want to go to Rishikesh, which was about
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 kilometers north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in New Delhi right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in New Delhi right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next morning I wake up and I think,
okay, I'm going to go down to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: taxi stand and I'll find a private car or
a taxi and I'll haggle with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, turns out it was like about 25
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for a 200 kilometer ride with
a private driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is not going to be a two hour drive
for those of you that have never... Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm lying across the back street,
like this back seat like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in one of these old 1950s styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some blotter acid with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I thought, should I or
shouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a blotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did I know that the main trunk
road, which linked Delhi to Rishikesh,
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually two lanes, but there was
eight lanes of traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of donkeys, of cows, of rickshaws,
of trucks, of buses, of cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of like, carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carts that they've been using for like
2000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like all along the side of the
road, there's people making tea and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling trinkets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mangy dogs.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the whole... And potentially a little
bit of death mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sitting back going, like,
this is like a IMAX Fellini movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you young guys out there, Fellini was
an Italian film director who used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: these way out movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made that crazy chick famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did he make famous?
[SPEAKER_02]: That big crazy weird chick that would
like... Divine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember Pink Flamingos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Pink Flamingos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must be old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we're diverting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so he's tripping on acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's driving up to Rishikesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the backseat of this taxi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight lanes of chaos going on
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're weaving in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indians have a sixth sense about when they
don't hit anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they hit each other or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just weaving in and out and I was
like just totally tricked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, man, I'm overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you saying to yourself, maintain,
maintain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best thing all, we finally got
there to Rishikesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me to this nice hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I walked in the lobby, they were
doing Pooja, which in India is a ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ringing bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these candles and these Brahmin
priests and chanting and I felt like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: To your arrival too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're tripping on acid, it's all
about timing in that moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could imagine that would have brought a
tear to your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as they say, and it is true with
acid or any psychedelic or even ganja for
[SPEAKER_00]: that matter, set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are of the most importance in terms
of the result of your experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should definitely be in the same vein
of quality as the substance you've sought
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when people have bad trips,
I think the main cause is the set and
[SPEAKER_00]: setting or disregarded or weren't taken
seriously enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's like 95% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bar setting, let's go drink a bunch of
beer or get super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're Prairie Boys, woo hoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, it's not going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, us just being aware of that fact,
we choose to take our ethnogens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here on the beautiful west coast
of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually just get away from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your small group and get into a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very personal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be around people that
you're willing to be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be uncomfortable around and sometimes it's
a simple, it's why you connect so deeply
[SPEAKER_02]: with people on psychedelics and on
entheogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering, Mark, with our free
style of talking and interviewing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what you call it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called hanging out and being friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know, are your viewers,
do they want to structure?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think they appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really appreciated our last video and
this is really what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple more bowls and just tell
great stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I read from the comments is that
there's some old school dudes out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't really sharing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really, and you brought that
out in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, one guy was like,
oh, I brought a lid of Panamanian red to
[SPEAKER_02]: Nam once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lid of Panamanian red.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I read that, I thought,
this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you said that word lid,
I mean, for all you people out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lid used to be like a dime bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many joints fit in a lid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another term that I hadn't come across
for the longest time was a term called
[SPEAKER_00]: cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a cop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means, do you want to buy,
do you want to procure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go cop some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cop some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the child's garden of
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hadn't heard that for like since
the seventies and I was at someone's house
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day and I think he was a
cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there and someone else was there
and the other person wanted to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to me, cop man, go ahead and
cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going, fuck, I haven't heard that
since 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's holding onto that lingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he was listening to the child's
garden of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever have that comedy album?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have heard it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The child's garden of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all these different,
like, there's the one where the guy's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, did you ever notice smoking
marijuana increases your musical ability?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the guy goes in the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the shower and someone opens the
door and they're like, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to have a hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Oh, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he takes a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, before that he was singing and he was
singing really badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: super bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden he turns that
into this crazy funk song and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: builds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, the horns and like bass come in
and he's got backup singers and it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: an album.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you, man, like when I was
young, getting high, listening to this
[SPEAKER_02]: album, it was funny shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that reminded me of it was
because there was another skit where the
[SPEAKER_02]: dude's like, there's three ways to,
to get grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the ways was to like,
you know, he's talking to a guy on the
[SPEAKER_02]: street and he like creates a distraction
and the guy drops his grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, and you caught that shit
and run.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've heard it, you'll laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised you don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it almost reminds me of a,
I don't know if you remember the fire sign
[SPEAKER_00]: theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old hippie stuff from the,
from the sixties even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late sixties that that was about the dawn
of FM radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was only born in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early seventies, 73 actually plus my
yellow bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great year, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dad killed it in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me and my favorite grateful dead years
are 77, 73 and 71.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what drugs they were doing
those particular years, but they were good
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were probably some sort of haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And various psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what other sativas are you rocking in
your stable these days?
[SPEAKER_02]: My stable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your special sativas?
[SPEAKER_00]: My special sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's the tie lights, which was a
tie string from Thailand, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lemony shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lemony shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story of that and there's numerous
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually a carpenter and he makes
beautiful wooden grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was putting inlays in him and stuff and
I market those and he's also a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: fan and we travel around Thailand
collecting genetics.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times I was told I had to
wait because of the paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these indigenous genetics in
Southeast Asia have been lost to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of course invites violence and
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the government and the police
lump all of it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can be as seriously in trouble
both with the law and the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they think that... Rocking a hard
place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the tie lights are excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You collected some seeds in somewhere in
northern Thailand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nakhon Prenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's northeast of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to Myanmar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambodia and Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in that area you've got a lot of good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked, although I'm not right now,
with the Laotian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite as strong as the Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Thai... Did you bring a
Cambodian sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a Cambodian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually from the Cambodian Thai
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come with a passport.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Campbell side?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say it didn't come with a
passport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found even when I was there in the 90s
that often especially in the islands in
[SPEAKER_02]: the south I was on Koh Lanta Yai and
collected some of the nicest herb I'd seen
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole time I was there and he was
like, yeah, I get it from Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, it was Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the Cambodian sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the Thai lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main primary sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to start to work with the
Congo and the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other sativas from different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were discussing this before about,
you know, Gajah comes from God and we all
[SPEAKER_00]: get it from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never pulled it out of my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collect seeds from living plants,
but even that plant was planted by someone
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can go back forever in the past and
forever into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are in this particular moment with
access to these particular genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And access to the resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's important for guys like you who
have the resources that have put in all
[SPEAKER_02]: these years, decades in fact, to continue
to do what they do because you get better
[SPEAKER_02]: at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and as you get better at
something and then you realize,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, like I've done all this amazing land.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've traveled the globe to collect
land-based sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now maybe I'll use a couple that are
right here that I have access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think right now in British
Columbia, we have access to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the help of the internet,
I feel like right now in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're the right person and you're the
right person, you can get online and show
[SPEAKER_02]: your passion and become a part of this
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems pretty possible for anyone to
acquire almost anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we break down that barrier of
giving out cuts with rules, it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I understand the fear that
there's not enough for you, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: good enough reason to keep ganja from
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not a good enough reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's true of the business side of
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that one protects one's product.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about something
different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business side of it says that,
but the spiritual side, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate using the word spiritual,
the life-affirming side of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is which should definitely be shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's when it becomes a business and we
get into this, that's mine Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to someone online who was like,
they were like, oh, you guys are all into
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing, then send me seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sort of was like, well, listen,
okay, it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share safely with people that we can
trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the seed business is created to
get seeds to the rest of the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there has to be, if guys like
you and Matt and Breeder Steve and Soma,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they don't breed genetics and sell them
on the open market, then other people will
[SPEAKER_02]: just produce a lesser product,
use the same pictures, use the names,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people won't get what they need to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand the business aspect of it
is necessary, but I don't believe that
[SPEAKER_02]: hoarding or controlling the mothers should
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's just, you know,
sure, you work with your strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: create your things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say someone else can't take
Congo and Sweets kind of can make
[SPEAKER_02]: something else that they make.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to bring something that's
unique, then don't collect a strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone has, go to the land-raised
strains like you did and pull it out of
[SPEAKER_02]: nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally, that Jamaican strain that I
have, man, it is a wild one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got two branches coming off one leaf,
two full growths, and a whole whole
[SPEAKER_02]: phytolaxy with the three leaves growing
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we love our mutants in the world of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can I offer you another bong rip on
our way out here, Doc?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last awesome stories for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or medicate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely happy to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my mentor, Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever met Ron?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna meet Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do have a couple more special
guests today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously John is always on Puff
Wednesday, which it is Puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Doc are just starting it off a
little early.
[SPEAKER_02]: John will be here probably in about 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt, the great gardener, should be
here also within any minute now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be kind of fun to have all four
of these guys together for a little puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, the Doc and I are going to take a
break and we'll catch up with you when the
[SPEAKER_02]: other guys get here.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for the genetics.
That's really awesome.
Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share your herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
