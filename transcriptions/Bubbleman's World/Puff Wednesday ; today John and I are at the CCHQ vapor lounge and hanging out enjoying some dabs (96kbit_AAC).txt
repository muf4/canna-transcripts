floors vapor lounge inspired by I'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: you know my original vapor lounge Which I
had on commercial drive in the early 2000s
[SPEAKER_00]: called the melting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was in 2001 two and three or 2002
three We have the inhalation station of
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization That was a good one we had
like six different kinds of vaporizers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the table at the bar and I'm still to
yourself That's cool like like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that is like oh it was like 2001 yeah,
someone's gotta be look at that the cash
[SPEAKER_00]: is dripping down Well we managed to film a
little puff Wednesday John I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked about that we weren't sure if we
were gonna Be able to give you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but here we are at cchq at the
vapor lounge and just often bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah The key in the key of green yep
gems the key I always thought Adam chose
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it was the the herb in the key
of green
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just kind of back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do another round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna hit this one this time
they're more cured out This is some more
[SPEAKER_00]: cured out like about a year old
[SPEAKER_01]: Fully equipped with everything is labeled
differently like Jody's that she goes oh
[SPEAKER_01]: you have like a rainbow there Well someone
said the other day you need to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: container These rubber ones worry me
though
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no corners
[SPEAKER_00]: Different way my friend owns this company,
and I like to support him, and I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people were putting hash in
these before I really sort of started
[SPEAKER_00]: putting full mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like that actually like I like
I'm more used to using like titanium meals
[SPEAKER_00]: from just friends At least like a black
scorcher when you obviously didn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: right so like if you try to low temp it
and you don't do it right You don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start fucking we just drip a
little bit and just go black and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: burning properly So it's just like you can
tell you fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that cuz like I found with
the titanium cuz like I'm still really
[SPEAKER_00]: needs dabbing everything right so like me
too Maybe a couple years But the weird
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with me is in a sense I was dabbing
without dabbing I was like hitting full
[SPEAKER_00]: melt bubble and dry sip for the last 12 to
15 years On a super tight stainless steel
[SPEAKER_00]: screen like fanning it with a V line or
something and it's just bubbling and
[SPEAKER_00]: melting so basically I'm dabbing,
but yeah, it's like it's not you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more archaic But not even
like with a lighter I'd be more like even
[SPEAKER_00]: even that bowls too dirty for me like if
you look at inside the bowl like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of flavor stopper I'd keep a
real clean bowl have real clean screens
[SPEAKER_00]: and just take like fresh hit so Just just
people are gonna be like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're such a snob or whatever,
but I've just No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a true thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm I'm more of a like a strip
like I'll take a ball and I'll take a
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty toe I've taken many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did it all through my 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we do it like Sometimes you want to
sit there and just have a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: clean toe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just really nice Yeah,
absolutely even this is too dirty for me
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and I only am using titanium
because my whip For my quartz it's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a new whip Yeah, I wrote over
it with my chair and severed the piece
[SPEAKER_00]: like an idiot So the good people at D now
have have sent me a new whip Multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice cooking be quartz bowls at my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this won't see I'd like to get the
little drop-down too I don't really like
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of putting the tie-nail directly
and even though it's it's fine It works,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we had our conversation last time
about the potential of breakage and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you took it and then and then the heat Oh,
whatever It's all good, man They were just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking I was just downstairs and they
should get a drop down for this It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true Drop down for this would be nice
right a little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like this nail was right here
That would be pretty sweet because then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just the nervousness of putting it in
a It's like definitely I was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: flap today I was like, what do you think
about the etiquette of like, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: putting this into Someone's mothership and
he was like, no, no, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't I'm Mark You too Kevin Lee
John and this is the bubble man's world
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh 20,000 of them out there that could
potentially be watching and if you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: want to come down Pump into guys like
these guys guys like us
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I have my own it's just it's
John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfello or And for sure, you know the
best part Sunday Sunday we do hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: a live stream wherever you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: And talk to talk to John and his neighbors
and talk to Horatio about making oil with
[SPEAKER_00]: delimiting the terpene instead of And
spoke with Darren about dry sifting and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean there was a whole bunch of great
people No, there you go, yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Mike took one yesterday and he said
it got through the day
[SPEAKER_01]: John broke like every bone in his body You
know some pretty major injuries,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's the healing of the nation as
Richie says yes No, so just different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something I thought about today
because it's something that fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting any kind of disease or condition
This is the way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: We should finish it off with a round of
the seven-year cured So this is master
[SPEAKER_01]: curse that It's actually I can see It
takes a few seconds because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes over time Evaporate out at room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a kind of a slow melt almost
like a lava But then as it as it as it
[SPEAKER_00]: accesses the oils inside that have been
preserved It starts bubbling really a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique taste almost perfumey on this
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well one more rip for John On
the seven-year cure and we're gonna call
[SPEAKER_00]: this puff Wednesday a day.
