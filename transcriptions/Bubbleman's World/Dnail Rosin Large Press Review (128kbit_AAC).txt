[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to bubble man's
world and I'm finally getting around to
[SPEAKER_00]: play around with the large size press
Rosin press from D nail You've seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: one with the five by five plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one is the 15 inches By 15
inches, so it's a fairly large unit It's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to give you a lot more
area to process a lot more material I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to go and do an overboard review
on it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really probably going to focus mostly
on hash as it's outside and I'm not really
[SPEAKER_00]: confident in the hole for but it's very
simple you can take a piece of parchment
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can use an oil slick and I'm
wondering if oil slick is going to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with D nail in there or if they're
going to make oil slick pads in the five
[SPEAKER_00]: inch by five inch as well as in a 15 inch
by 15 inch because it would be wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: just to slide that right in there put all
your buds down or your hash your envelope
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're going to press simply put
another one over top and give it your 10
[SPEAKER_00]: second press But I do want to talk a
little bit about You know getting this
[SPEAKER_00]: machine getting it out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely heavy So I really would
want to warn you guys that if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: back issues or you have any sort of
ailments that could be increased by moving
[SPEAKER_00]: something heavy Please get help with this
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awkward It's got the top piece here
that screws down to lower the plate and
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not tight because of course
you need leeway for the plates to move up
[SPEAKER_00]: and down You get this sort of motion in
the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be careful with that Once
it is on you should understand that these
[SPEAKER_00]: top and bottom plates get very hot I've
got it at about 120 degrees Celsius right
[SPEAKER_00]: now Which is around 245 to 250 Fahrenheit
There's a whole variety of temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use with this unit and I'll
talk about that a little bit But first I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to really discuss You know the
getting this out of the box and and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get it working So let me just
turn my phone off and make sure we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get interrupted there So like I said,
you're gonna want to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect distance with my smaller unit
because this unit I could literally close
[SPEAKER_00]: it right right to the bottom and there's a
space Here about an inch or two at the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the unit and it allows us a little
bit of leeway If we're not getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: of a press and you can see I'm getting a
really good press on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to lower it anymore It's got
the two units So here's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that you're gonna have with this
unit if you're using it at a small house
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not actually at a commercial
processing facility is the power it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more power than the smaller unit and
for Example the smaller unit I can plug
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides into one extension cord and
plug it into a plug Well with this one if
[SPEAKER_00]: you plug both of these even onto the same
circuit in your house, you'll most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: blow Blow the fuse which I did a couple of
times trying to figure out I have one
[SPEAKER_00]: plugged in over here with an extension
cord and I have one plugged in Fair
[SPEAKER_00]: distance over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is much a little bit more Work to
figure out how to get this thing to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it might not be a problem for
many Of you you might have it all set up
[SPEAKER_00]: with your power and you've got this plug
here and that plug there and they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: different circuits Perfect, but do be do
pay attention to that because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that happened to me Also,
like I said very heavy you're gonna want
[SPEAKER_00]: to find out where you want to put this
thing and pretty much leave it there So
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we've got our temperatures up to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of using the oil slicks at
pads But you know, I think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: press a good chunk of hash for this and
really sort of utilize the surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have to go with because you know,
it's it's The amount of hash increased
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the problem on the five by five I
can keep putting more and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's what's the problem is is how
far the rosin the resin Excretes out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash when pressed with that little X
amount of heat It pushes further and
[SPEAKER_00]: further out and what I was finding was as
I started going over around three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: grams I was able to push the rosin right
to the end of the parchment paper on the
[SPEAKER_00]: five by five unit the small D Nail press
this being the large D Nail press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to have that
problem I guess we could probably just get
[SPEAKER_00]: right to it So I've got myself a pressing
screen and this is a pressing screen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's already been used To collect bubble
hash and I found it laying around and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little bit dirty and what I did was
it's simply cut in half and I've had the
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece removed from the from the edge
which is the rim the blue rim that went
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way around there and Basically
what I did was because it was very sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: not holding together I just folded the end
up and I stuck it in the press and closed
[SPEAKER_00]: it for about two seconds And now you can
see that this is nice It's staying it's
[SPEAKER_00]: staying closed and I so I did it to both
ends And what it did is is it allowed me
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a little pouch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what I'll do once I get a lot of
the bubble in there I'll fold the third
[SPEAKER_00]: side over much like just like That I'll
have my envelope and I'll be able to lay
[SPEAKER_00]: it down nicely in the parchment in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we even get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To go down Just like that there we go it's
actually quite efficient for you know
[SPEAKER_00]: using none of the pressure whatsoever just
the Little bit of heat that's coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there Couple seconds ought to do it so
yeah that gives me a nice big Unit here a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice big filter bag now you can pick up
these screens right now as blotting
[SPEAKER_00]: screens pressing screens rosin screens We
sell them at fresh head ease calm or
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bag calm and of course I share a
lot of information with you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm never going to be More happy than
if you if you turn around and support
[SPEAKER_00]: support what I'm doing by supporting my
company we try to have great customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service we try to give you the best dollar
bang for your buck and Yeah, so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pick those up what I'm going to do is I'm
having my manufacturer Develop these small
[SPEAKER_00]: bags like this We're not quite sure how we
want to do it whether we're going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them fold and stays whether we're going to
sew them all up We'll figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen, but I want them to come
in 1 gram 5 gram 10 gram 100 gram
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially even 500 gram envelopes And
then I also want to have special ones for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flowers They won't be quite like
a pouch, but maybe more like a tube I
[SPEAKER_00]: found some good luck in pressing with two
Of screen I wrap it all up and fill it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with ground-up herb And I've been getting
some decent returns and don't get me wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: after today when you see this and you're
saying oh What about the flowers are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to press flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a little second review on this
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the D-mail large Rosin press Hash
review, so that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some beautiful bubble cash here
It was a gift from a friend these are
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder Steve strains, and it's very gooey
and gooey Nice quality presses together
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give it about a four star Maybe a
three in its melt category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown outdoors a greenhouse dash
field and basically it produced a very
[SPEAKER_00]: lovely profile of resin it just wasn't
able with a Canadian Sun to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful enough boost To really push it
over the five and six star level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not going to be a problem for
us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have The ability to unveil quality
so that's what we're going to do for you
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take some of this actually
let me go get the scale because I know you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are going to want to know the amounts
All right, so I grabbed the scale Grabbed
[SPEAKER_00]: another little dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not even sure how much is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be 40 or 50 grams total here
I'm not sure if we're going to run it all
[SPEAKER_00]: but Yeah, this is about 40 grams forty
point three grams It's got a real lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: smell to it I think there's some blockhead
and some sweet skunk and maybe some Plum
[SPEAKER_00]: some some nice varieties from Steve over
the years that these guys are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's You know it really it really is nice
bubble Just not quite at that level for
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know great stuff for making coconut
oil extracts great stuff for All different
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of Metables and even the addition of
a Remo style supercharged Joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know great stuff for such a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to melt up and plug plug
your whole unit Let's see how much of this
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get into our little Our little our
little unit here
[SPEAKER_00]: Well looks like it all went in pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's real lovely so I guess the
best bet is to sort of get it all even So
[SPEAKER_00]: it's there's no empty spots in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packet All right a Little little bit of a
hand press and Let's see we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll wait till we press some of
this loveliness and then we'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little So We get this open to the desired
Size these D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nails are very much the size of the
parchment paper, so it becomes quite
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient See if we can't feed that in it
becomes a bit of a Funny thing when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start playing around with this parchment
it starts rolling like that so it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes this small Bit of a challenge To
get it in and then get it straightened
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I just applied the smallest amount
of heat I don't want to apply too much and
[SPEAKER_00]: put any sort of ripples in the material
but you might as well get the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: working for you and This is just one of
the things that I find is very convenient
[SPEAKER_00]: about it that that little bit of press and
heat I mean, it's basically a large iron
[SPEAKER_00]: so you Put yourself in a situation where
if something's rolled off if your screen
[SPEAKER_00]: won't close well I mean one of the things
I found amazing with these screens is if I
[SPEAKER_00]: take the smallest amount of rosin and I
clip it on each corner I didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it with this because there was actually
resin present on this screen already so
[SPEAKER_00]: the minute I just Heated it up the
slightest bit that resin warmed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of became like a glue that's holding
my screen together And I definitely that's
[SPEAKER_00]: about the only kind of glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind personally So, let me just
get one more piece of this cut off for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I'm using unbleached parchment paper
This is another issue that many people
[SPEAKER_00]: have been discussing We've been discussing
it on hash church all the different sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of footprints and the sort of different
things that can be present in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different products Pay attention be
conscious, you know learn if you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to Admit that you didn't know it
before and that now you're gonna do your
[SPEAKER_00]: best To try and keep things as safe as
possible and that's you know, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: example of saying use using a very
bleached Parchment paper not really the
[SPEAKER_00]: best idea Especially with the heat
transfer, you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring something like bleach so We
got these about sorted out here All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice big size there get them semi ready
Like I said, I'm gonna give just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a press and I know this table is
probably making you guys nervous with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership and the And the D nail press
it's got a tiny little bit of motion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I promise you I'm paying very careful
attention So I've got this organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I press it I showed you a little
earlier There's four screws four springs
[SPEAKER_00]: on each side and you know You could get
this to a point where it becomes so
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to close that it's actually
close to a danger especially If you do get
[SPEAKER_00]: it closed when you open it back up the
whole unit will tend to jump up like a
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little frog So be careful about
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good maximum pressure going but I
certainly wouldn't you know suggest to
[SPEAKER_00]: people that That they go too far with the
pressure I think that the safer units will
[SPEAKER_00]: be the pneumatic presses the hydraulic
presses that have You know either air or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydraulic that allow to get that much more
pressure When you when you close it and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these units work with a single
button or two buttons that you push
[SPEAKER_00]: together so quite a nice Alternative so
here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: My single largest press of rosin ever 40
grams of bubble hash and what we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do is we're gonna get this in here first
Nice big thing in there
[SPEAKER_01]: This one on top of that First time
actually doing this but it seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay working All right guys we got this on
the 10-second timer let's give it a shot
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go You can hear it sizzling
beautifully seven six five four three two
[SPEAKER_00]: one Boom you feel that boom snap up when
it pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah That is just lovely Try to hold
that up for you guys to see it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: quite something Boom and I would say that
why don't I slowly start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting it And we want to make sure
because we're outside in the in the wind
[SPEAKER_00]: here that none of this blows away,
of course so Now this is a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin what I think I'm going to do is I'll
collect it off-camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you here in the sticky-ticky
tacky I will give you a few options for
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can clean this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put these in the freezer That out
of there actually well, it's still nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's one good idea actually to do
if you can Get your packet moved away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin guys that beautiful Really
beautiful I don't have the most amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Gonna have to put this over here
for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell that there's still lots more
gooey goodness left in there so I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't gotten quite my 50% but There's a
nice big driplet of rosin And you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: I will of course take some macro
photographs of this I know you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the macro photographs and Well,
you know what I think I'm gonna do is I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm going to this right here and go
for another shot This time we use a single
[SPEAKER_00]: piece All right, so let's try this again
Grab this gooey gooey packet of goodness
[SPEAKER_00]: Slap it right down into the middle
actually got a wasp Floating around the
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks quite interested In this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably like all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been watching the internet He's been
paying attention to the hype and he wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to know should I get a rosin press all
right, so
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go Press down on that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the 10-second timer set which is
very cool It just counts down the minute
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual unit hits that was 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a few more shots Booyah All right
and Not to disappoint She squeezed out
[SPEAKER_00]: another great amount
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm gonna clean these up real quick all
right guys So I'm gonna share a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of this with you just cuz it's easy and
quick I went and found a marbleslinger
[SPEAKER_00]: pendant that he did years ago for me
actually this is the bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: marbleslinger pendant and I just you know
I've seen people doing it with the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass online, and I knew it would be
easy But I'm not sure if you can see this
[SPEAKER_00]: middle section here how it's this really
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the greasy Stuff that's usually the
hardest to pick up well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is picking it up absolutely
simplistically So if you've got any glass
[SPEAKER_00]: I Can show you right here that the shape
isn't even that important I could easily
[SPEAKER_00]: move the glass at an angle and use more if
I want But I'm finding that the edge is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite efficient, but watch the speed in
which I can pick this rosin up
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think if I had a frame holding this
rosin paper down I could do things even
[SPEAKER_00]: faster Tiny little piece broke free there
[SPEAKER_00]: All right well that is very rewarding how
well that cleaned the parchment Even still
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go over it and grab those last
little remnants and basically Clean this
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment up to a like new substance Nice
little bit of rosin sitting on there Why
[SPEAKER_00]: don't we move into our second sheet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold this one out of the way As we will be
using it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get the stickiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the back of this unit onto the
front of this unit, so And we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful Really really nice results for
this particular batch and it gets Glad the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling of this is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could describe it picking up
literally grams if not an ounce or more of
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin off of the sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean wow this is probably at 10 grams
and the other one was maybe 5 grams and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually we could We could get up to the
ounce at a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have more Ability to press what
we have as well, so we'll see what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: with that
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think the best way to remove this
rosin will be to hold I'll probably hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass Much like this and then just
heat it up so the rosin can drip off onto
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I'll even crack it off once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know Either or that's a really
nice chunk of rosin right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's only the first two Complete so
see what we got over here That just looks
[SPEAKER_00]: great doesn't that look great in the Sun
all right, so Cleaned up a lot nicer this
[SPEAKER_00]: time around still a little bit of resin on
the edge of this of this guy here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but You can see here how in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaned up really really nice Not
leaving too too much rosin on one side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the parchment, but leaving a very nice
amount on the other side, so
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of getting almost too much rosin on
here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to get a little bit tacky
for me Grab the last little bit of this
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, this is getting way tacky you're
gonna have to change Change my format
[SPEAKER_00]: change my technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now doing the The quick pull which is
what I usually do When it's not working
[SPEAKER_00]: the wiping technique sometimes when you go
to wipe You're just not gonna get the love
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're looking for that's not a
problem You can be just as efficient with
[SPEAKER_00]: your cleanup now imagine if I used a small
Titanium you know dabber try and pick all
[SPEAKER_00]: this up That is a lot of rosin as you can
see it is now completely covered the
[SPEAKER_00]: pendant so Let's see what we can do here A
little bit more here this other side was
[SPEAKER_00]: not cleaned as well as I would have liked
it to be I did take just a few macro
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs of the rosin to give you an
idea of the quality Let's get that closed
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we go There we go a nice chunk
of rosin by anyone's standards All right
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, so I've been collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got just over 13 grams Here you can see
it's a quite thick I'm gonna press it out
[SPEAKER_00]: in a few seconds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it flattened out So it looks like
a nice big half ounce that it is we used
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 grams You know I forgot that the hash
we used was a lower grade than my The
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I'm using my four star that
usually gives me about 50 to 55 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff actually gives me closer to 33
to 35 percent return We've got 13 grams so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pressed a third That's cracking off
very cool This is a small batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's much more than maybe
a gram or two there What I have done is I
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to talk about a little bit well
before I finish the review here is the the
[SPEAKER_00]: act of collecting I did go and grab my
little bubble man Pendant I know they also
[SPEAKER_00]: have these big stamps that people are
using glass stamps with a large glass
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that you can just sort of do this
to Great idea if you don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: that And in particular if you've already
pressed your material a few times and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting towards the end of the
press And you're leaving it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer accessing more heat You can end up
getting a material that comes out a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less stable than the original batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very stable very hard Very thick
the last little batch here that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little less than stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still get it collected in If I have
a trick up my sleeve, so what I have done
[SPEAKER_00]: is I bought one of these cold Freud's it's
a for paramedics actually reusable hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: cold compress and it's been in my freezer
and what I do with this is How I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect with this is simply I use a dabber
for this particular batch and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it on this thing because it'll get
so cold that as you start collecting it
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just starts cracking and flicking This
stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is literally move that out of
the way Get your thing back onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: paper and once you've cooled it a little
bit Then you can go and do some collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's just picking up like Nobody's
business beautiful beautiful pickup job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be too tripped out if you end up
with a sappy material You've been you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been pressing hard and you can't collect
it You might think that you can put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the freezer get it all frozen and then try
to collect it I find it that is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more difficult Than the simplicity of
using a cold plate underneath something
[SPEAKER_00]: cold underneath even frozen peas for God's
sakes Just something that you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath to give it that little bit of
cold So when you go back to collect it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is collecting really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just collected a whole Chunk of that
parchment right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little dab Mountain man dab,
maybe not not me not me dab, but I you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I don't have a problem with people
doing huge dabs I mean why not if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's what you do and that's your
thing and You know, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to take many many dabs
throughout the day more efficient in size
[SPEAKER_00]: than You know giant large huge grams,
but dude I straight-up applaud those that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have fun and are blasting Big
monster rips through their rigs good for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna have to get back onto this
coolness here just for a little bit It
[SPEAKER_00]: just gives me just the tiniest bit of cold
And lets me collect the resin without
[SPEAKER_00]: Without it greasing up and wanting to stay
behind on the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using a task rock highly educated
dabber and carb cap to pick this up right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and Mostly what you do is you collect
the resin on top of itself So as it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: building You can you can actually just
start rolling it much like a ball and the
[SPEAKER_00]: minute it starts getting too tacky Just go
right back over to your cold Plate or your
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Whatever you have that's giving
you that access to immediately different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature Because this stuff is very
very sensitive to temperature changes
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we got half of that done
Another side I'm suspecting this will be
[SPEAKER_00]: at least a couple of more grams get us up
to 15 grams for for the total return on 40
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of Pretty pretty nice bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it wasn't melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definite no melt, but The really
nice flavors well-grown just not grown to
[SPEAKER_00]: that final fruition that you know us as
the hash lover as the connoisseurs Like to
[SPEAKER_00]: see but what a beautiful thing that rosin
is what a beautiful thing that D nail has
[SPEAKER_00]: done to come out with these modified
t-shirt presses with D nail standards D
[SPEAKER_00]: nail customer service and You know,
hopefully sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be supplying them with some pressing
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, please, you know, it's always
appreciated when you support the company
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh headies and bubble bag comm we have
your hash making needs whether it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin presses we will be carrying these
very soon on the site whether it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags We have them all sorts from
standards originals and lights Whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bubble boxes tumble nows dry sift
screens, whatever your hash each needs are
[SPEAKER_00]: for the solventless quiver Bubble man and
bubble bags has you covered so please
[SPEAKER_00]: support us and if you like this video Give
us a like down below and if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it and want to see more videos like
this Then please give us a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always appreciate when you share our
content your social media is How we get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there my social media only takes me to
you But you take me to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world so much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna continue here collecting this
last little bit I'm gonna have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through my macro photographs I didn't take
as many as you guys probably would have
[SPEAKER_00]: liked but I got a nice three or four that
can show you the quality Of what was
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll throw in a little I guess the
melt video is not as exciting with Rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's an oil It's not a hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've created it as an oil,
of course it's gonna have a melt factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: seven star because Oil is material that
melts every time every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I've never seen oil in my life,
but didn't melt So there we go collected
[SPEAKER_00]: Another couple of G's We'll get that on
the scale real quick We'll take a final
[SPEAKER_00]: dab Let me get the D nail on here That
brought over Always nice to have a oil
[SPEAKER_00]: slick to put your pipe down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that sound of putting the pipe down
on on something that's a hard substance
[SPEAKER_00]: that you haven't That you're not paying
attention to and it gives that that hard
[SPEAKER_00]: that sound that glass sound that you put
down so Shout out to oil slick for hooking
[SPEAKER_00]: it up Saving bongs one bong at a time
Alright, so obviously for a process like
[SPEAKER_00]: this the less heat the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just heating up the tip of the
Alright, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the final number gonna be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Final numbers thirteen point nine thirteen
point nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a dab of it because I'm sure
it's wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Nice long elongated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see make sure we're up here 300
well, it's just Collect that all up and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll wait a few more seconds for that to
get up to temperature God it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful bubble Bubble rosin I should say
the bubble hash was a variety of 120
[SPEAKER_00]: micron through 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was 73 90 micron and 120 Present
in that bubble hash we squeezed it through
[SPEAKER_00]: a 25 micron screen all 40 grams of it and
Well, we ended up with so far 13 grams I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm gonna be able to squeeze a
couple more grams out just by giving what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably do is I'll open this up I'll
Remove it from the large screen that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in and I'm gonna fold it upon itself to
get it a little bit thicker I'll put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a separate size screen and I'll squeeze
that through and see If I can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I like that I'm gonna turn this guy
off here I Want to thank you guys for
[SPEAKER_00]: watching if you guys have any questions,
please comment in the comments below I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: try to answer as many as I can I do miss
some comments here and there but All in
[SPEAKER_00]: all a great unit just a few key things To
keep in touch in mind don't plug them into
[SPEAKER_00]: the same circuit in your house or your
your commercial place Make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: tighten the unit so hard that when you go
to close it, it's barely able to open We
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to see that and otherwise just
you know, keep your temperatures down
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment you can experiment with
temperatures as low as 90 Celsius and go
[SPEAKER_00]: up to or 80 Celsius for that matter and go
up to 120 130 Celsius now and Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be around 190 Fahrenheit
upwards or 180 Fahrenheit upwards to
[SPEAKER_00]: around 250 personally what I find is when
I'm Extracting from hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my temperatures a little
bit lower and when I'm extracting with
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, I usually keep them a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: However for this experiment I actually
pressed this at the temperature that I
[SPEAKER_00]: normally press cannabis at it was around
245 degrees Fahrenheit a little bit warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: Than usual I do have some of this hash
that I'll be able to compare to the rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: oil I should say I have some that I made
some time ago and I'll compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll compare the colors I'll compare the
tastes see if the terpene profile was that
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly affected by the excess heat and
the only thing I'd really add is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get yourself a little laser
temperature and You close this up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get you're at say 250 degrees Fahrenheit
and you pull the thing out like right away
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hit it with the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the oil itself is going
to be closer to around 90 to 120 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius so Sorry, not Celsius,
but Fahrenheit a hundred hundred and fifty
[SPEAKER_00]: tops So it's all interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning every day I definitely want
to hear from you guys and if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: more questions like I said just answer
them in the comments and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the D nail review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with just over 13 grams half
ounce made it in a very short time
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the video I did with d420k and
How I'm gonna leave you is simply By
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing out this little bit of rosin that
we have here and showing you what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like You know not in a giant puck So let's
see if we can't It's interesting to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how to how to work with this stuff as well
like after you know for me not having
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with Oil for so so long and I I
know a lot of you consider this stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: be hash But I really still call it oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's very important or
not the aspect of Whether or not we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be calling this oil or hash,
but I'm old school I go with what the old
[SPEAKER_00]: school guys are saying and when I see
Robert Connell Clark explaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between oil and hash in in
hashish it just leads me to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are indeed some differences between
oil and hashish All right, there we go
[SPEAKER_00]: guys Give thanks for the rosin press
really appreciate the kindness of D nail
[SPEAKER_00]: sending these out for me to test and You
know so far the the small unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've absolutely loved it I love the
ability to plug it into the same plug But
[SPEAKER_00]: this unit is a whole different ballgame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really could see how you could get
your production game on with one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things See if we can't get this open here
It's so nice to have this cold pack here
[SPEAKER_00]: because you just you give this a little a
little press just to Get that bottom half
[SPEAKER_00]: a little cooler top half removed real nice
But that bottom half is still still
[SPEAKER_00]: holding on just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go All right guys Thanks for
watching bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave you with the rosin Hey guys,
so I turned the unit back on I had my 13
[SPEAKER_00]: plus grams I was doing the math just
didn't seem like enough What I realized is
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't shown you what the hash looked
like on the inside of the screen And I
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of wanted to show you guys that so
when I opened it I noticed that right away
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of it looked very like almost this
pale ish tan color almost not white but
[SPEAKER_00]: White ish and it sort of shows that oh,
everything's almost out of here But when I
[SPEAKER_00]: opened it further in the inside Trapped
between the two layers of very very dry
[SPEAKER_00]: material was still what I would consider a
decent amount of resin So I turned the
[SPEAKER_00]: unit back on I just literally did another
press which you can see right here is
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if that stuff's not opening
properly this looked really greasy I did
[SPEAKER_00]: have to use a little bit of excess heat to
get at it, but I Suspect there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of grams there at least a gram and
if I were to press it Maybe one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: more times I could squeeze another gram
out each time just having to use more
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure I did press it off camera,
but I had tightened it even more You
[SPEAKER_00]: should have seen the way this thing kicked
up when I lifted it up it felt like I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be doing that again I'm gonna open
it up just a tiny little bit on the back
[SPEAKER_00]: here Way Better to be safer than sorry I
suppose that came off quite nice You see
[SPEAKER_00]: another big nice press through the XL The
thing about that's really nice about this
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I would have be hard set to do
this in my smaller unit I was nowhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: you know 40 grams I was pressing four and
five grams, and it was already starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah, that's starting to feel better
now starting to feel A lot less sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: than it's been there is a couple of sticky
spots in each middle and we'll get to
[SPEAKER_00]: those See if we can't clean this up nice
and quick this stuff just turns to shatter
[SPEAKER_00]: almost immediately upon the contact with
the cold In larger amounts it'll stay
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just shattering We'll just take it
off and put it on the oil slick a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit Picking it up here with the Highly
educated Gabber That's why I was rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: it around and then it gets to a point
where all of a sudden it won't roll
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore and it's you know the power of the
oil overtakes the weakness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment so Just be careful and be
patient as I said that a piece of rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: just jumped up onto my wrist But yeah be
patient in your collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually quite a bit I'd say this
is gonna be another couple of grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm feeling better about that already
I've got my returns up in the 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percentile 30 to 35 anyway and That is a
lot better So never jump the gun and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: your your end product away Always always
but well it doesn't take a brain surgeon
[SPEAKER_00]: to believe when you when you open it up
And you see that it's gummy and sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not what it's supposed to look
like so for people that don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you can learn a
value right here and right now when the
[SPEAKER_00]: material is done has In particular it
really won't have any stick left to it
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to you'll be able to know
that you got everything out and as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doubting and you're thinking I
don't think I got everything out you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably didn't so go with that and get
back to your press and Give it another
[SPEAKER_00]: shot each time like I say you can
experiment around with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of heat that you're using the
amounts of pressure that you're using All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so I did bring the rod Over here
Kind of wouldn't mind finding out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: excess extra is that we got on here
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just closed it It's the beauty
of rosin and just pull them pull the pin
[SPEAKER_00]: They twist it a few times just so it
doesn't hold on to a lot of excess,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got there two grams 1.9
grams So that was a good press,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know leaving that behind could have
what would have been detrimental This is
[SPEAKER_00]: another great way to clean rosin up using
itself as the main Clean you got rosin on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sides of your parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clean it up pretty good like this
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty Beautiful beautiful Get that
back in there, this is too hot right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually once I turn this Back down
You know quite a bit like it really only
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be warm rather than hot And I
just will give it another little press and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into one solid piece But I think
for now we really are gonna have to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: another batch of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly hard you can always lower it and
and raise it with this piece here But
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously not when you're in the middle of
a press Go We go again On the cool plate
[SPEAKER_00]: and I suspect this is Really getting down
to it now, maybe a gram there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a half gram every little bit helps
I'm certainly not gonna say no to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Will continue to collect this and once
I've got it collected next we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: open up the packet the screen envelope and
We'll we'll see if we can't show you
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in 15.5 grams I added all the extra
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a little bit more than I
thought I was gonna get but the part I
[SPEAKER_00]: really was interested in doing with you
guys is showing you what's in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so You can tell close up bring it to you
You can see that there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: resin here But for the most part the
screen is actually fairly clean There's
[SPEAKER_00]: some here as well and this is old resin
that was on there earlier that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we flip it over to the other side
We've got the same thing we got these two
[SPEAKER_00]: center batches and that's where the resin
was really feeding out But you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rest of the screen Maintained
quite a beautiful clarity So these two
[SPEAKER_00]: little spots in the center tell me that
there's the tiniest bit more resin for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to acquire But I did want to kind of open
this up a little bit and show you What is
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how that little bit of
resin that I put on there at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: really closed that up nicely And that was
a little bit of bubble ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear what you've done with
bubble I've done a few varieties of funny
[SPEAKER_00]: things one time I got myself out of a
locked bathroom in Jamaica using bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: and some Other things so there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see towards the edge That it's
quite done and then as you go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle Right you go into the middle and
you can see there's still some resin in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some gooey goodness,
so I'm going to continue on pressing this
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be part of the review I
will let you know in the comments section
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've already gone overboard on this
video and extended it longer than I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I would by coming back and doing
the rest but There you have it guys D nail
[SPEAKER_00]: press large in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Got to give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give it a couple of thumbs up for
certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an Efficient unit if any
of you realize the last time d4 20k And I
[SPEAKER_00]: did a video where it was turning,
you know the half ounce into An ounce 30
[SPEAKER_00]: grams into a half ounce That was a much
nicer bubble that took us almost three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours using hair straighteners two of us
We both ended up kind of giving ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a shoulder injury on it It
was kind of ridiculous So if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding yourself with a with an injury due
to a hair straightener This unit is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to be for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for watching bubble man's world
everyone And we will look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing you all next time You You You You
[SPEAKER_02]: You You You You You You
