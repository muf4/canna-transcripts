[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puff Wednesday with John B.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went and dropped off, well,
you guys all saw what we just did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went to Air Canada Cargo and
dropped off five mothers, the Betty Kush,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is going to secure John's genetics
and his strain for himself and for anyone
[SPEAKER_06]: else who finds it as a beneficial strain
for pain management.
[SPEAKER_06]: For anything really, but for pain
management is what John's using it for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we've gotten those plants out
of our truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're just sitting here at the
airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom, and here's another one coming,
lining up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're in Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just on the way into Richmond from
the airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about 10 feet below sea level right
now, which is kind of trippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're 10 feet below sea level?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about 10 feet below sea level,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ocean's right there, so it's kind
of trippy to think we're a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: below the level of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, why don't we have a sash,
John?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't find any water, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hit this thing dry all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some orange juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to use orange juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make a little wind barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's how we block the wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little torch up.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to get into?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into some... Oh,
geez.
[SPEAKER_06]: What to get into?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like we do, I'm going to smoke yours
and you're going to smoke mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this little guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: FedEx coming in hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of cool being in Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to happen every once in a
while, what we do in this little session.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start with what you put me
right in front of me here, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, watermelon, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm basically bound and destined to smoke
all of John's medicine that I helped him
[SPEAKER_06]: make.
[SPEAKER_06]: Told him I couldn't take any, but I would
damn sure smoke it all as we hung out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we do when we get to
smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: See that little bit of wind is actually
helping.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to watch the wind too, but we are
in the flight path.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are getting the plane landing behind
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a moon, beautifully half full moon
up there in the sky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I used to come here when I used
to be like 16, 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to have to just park our cars here
and sit in our cars and lie in the hoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they took that away from us and now
you got to park and they made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Laying up, putting the, you know,
driving up on the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just on the grass.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no park.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just grab the bone here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you should.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need to wait for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got your own scene happening over
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just my little silly scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to top it off with a little bit
of DK420 because I am supposed to be
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking your stuff right now and not my
own.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, DK, once again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be a little hard right
now to use the B line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to be using this on a
lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in the wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is windy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman rips in Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: No complaints there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's no great.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, pass it over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass over to number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always know how good number four tastes
and smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my, I would say it is
definitely the favorite of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that I have other than Medi and
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's just real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good old Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dropping off moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on our way to Mega Hill Pizza right
after this, where we will pretty much do
[SPEAKER_06]: what we're doing right now, except we'll
do it indoors while eating pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: While eating pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get a medicated pizza this time
maybe, hey?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lightly medicated?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lightly medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we should give that a shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes hard to get the nail hot enough
and you get these light, light,
[SPEAKER_06]: really nice vapor rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the really nice vapor rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I was just,
you know, over here taking one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And enjoying, I mean, what we just did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what we just did was really kind
of cool when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm feeling a little bit more safe
for knowing that no matter what happens
[SPEAKER_04]: with the program, I will have access to
something that I use every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's key.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just, I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, all you haters out there
about certain things, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to understand that standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, medicine is needed for people
who are suffering from a different disease
[SPEAKER_04]: and conditions and are sick and dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we've got to look at great
access and the world is changing to legal
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got to get this little wind proof
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's getting nicely heated up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicely wind proofing the Pitman.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be hooking up the Dino
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was three nice little rips here
at Flight Path Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to pretty much maybe have a
few more off camera and make our way down
[SPEAKER_06]: to Mega Hill Pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: So next stop, Mega Hill Pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: More ribs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are standing on the top of the
Arctic Circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on top of the world, John.
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to be on top of the world with
you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is British Columbia?
[SPEAKER_06]: North America.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like Vancouver Island right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that would be Vancouver YBR.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're standing on yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm standing at YBR.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, look at that big sun dog around the
sun right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can, but it sure looks
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool what they've done here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Walking on top of the world, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next stop, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks for the morning rising sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a breath of life, oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax and free and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a nap with you because I'm
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax and free and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I want to dive with you because I'm
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rise up this morning feeling in the mood
to dive away today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dive away today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw my good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said to me, one dive will kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax and free and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a nap with you because I'm
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax and free and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I want to dive with you because I'm
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, make it ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dive with you because I'm
feeling good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever taken that before,
take it easy if you know say you're a one
[SPEAKER_00]: time beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this advice from the DJ Asher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seek medical help if you don't feel
proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't want them to prescribe ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because them demand they realize it's your
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's burn one down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've made it to Megahill.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hitting the D-Nail and we're about
to order up some pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took clones earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: We shipped plants off.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now at Megahill.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hit it up with another rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was Sweet Sky, but it's
actually Jack Carrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full metal dry sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what's really cool with
actually going from here to Canada and
[SPEAKER_03]: cargo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dropping off those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: On my phone it says five live plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five live plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk loud.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So painfully, because we're at Megahill,
I was just talking about dropping off five
[SPEAKER_01]: live plants here to Canada and cargo.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about me driving down the highway?
[SPEAKER_06]: With the plants freezing out of the top of
the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the lids blew off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh that was the beginning start that we
never showed you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually it was a little epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of feeling pulled over by every
single thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should do this later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like yeah okay we should buy them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send down this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on their way to it's next
destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza coming.

[SPEAKER_06]: Nice cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're meeting your fine establishment
here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everyone's fine establishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I've only been a few times but
the last time John and I were here it was
[SPEAKER_06]: literally the perfect restaurant
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a few friends that we recognize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted that Amsterdam experience
here just with their own style of pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam does not have this experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I'm not dissing on Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like you got your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not covering this in the media
because it's Amsterdam like.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're covering it because it's new and
it's different and it's unlike anything
[SPEAKER_06]: that anyone's got going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super stoked with all the coverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just like okay this is just
completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just got more bananas and more bananas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much the most bananas anything
I've ever seen that wasn't like Mark
[SPEAKER_06]: Emery.
[SPEAKER_06]: He always went right to the Wall Street
Journal and all these ridiculous stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time magazine and Jimmy Fallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good publicity.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't any like this place would be
shut down or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone was like I love David Letterman
who's like oh so they open up a pub.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sell pizza in Vancouver and everyone
just started cheering.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a slight pause and then it was a
cheering.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't like laughing or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like wow that really went home to me
is like what this place is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean but they have pizza places in
Cambodia that serve wheat pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of just doing it here in North
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's Cambodia as well right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Vancouver has its own unique
geographic vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the epic mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're right out the windows there just
on the other side of these buildings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the city that we just came from
Richmond where we were at like Flight Path
[SPEAKER_06]: Park watching the planes fly over us and
hitting bowls there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you literally be up to the mountain
in a matter of 15 minutes from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah from there it was 10 minutes 15
minutes to get here another 10-15 you're
[SPEAKER_06]: on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want the you can go to the valley and
get the farm feel in Abbotsford and very
[SPEAKER_07]: Alberta like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whistler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whistler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day.

[SPEAKER_07]: Steam store board festival for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah it's a telus festival starts and
that'll be 11 or 12 days of absolute
[SPEAKER_07]: complete chaos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking Saturday is the best day.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got De La Soul playing on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: De La Soul will be great.
[SPEAKER_06]: He hasn't been to Whistler in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like honestly like 10 years I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah and we got from swollen members.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Prevail performing right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my agent so I should be able to
get us backstage for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good dude for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I snowboarded with him randomly just a few
times by accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: They love Whistler yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah it was actually on Cypress both
times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like oh that's Prevail.

[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay right on Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right great to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right well we're basically going to
order up a couple of pizzas and we'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: back in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah they came in and they were like okay
so they made some specially made pizzas
[SPEAKER_04]: here guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could have some but it's got meat
all over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that one piece over there if you
pulled the pepperoni piece on the back off
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I could probably eat that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all garlicky and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say this infused pizza because
this one's the infused one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've stepped it up a notch guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is infused?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh we're getting baked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they put a graham and crystal
LSD on it but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right my vegetarian pizza just showed
up and I have got to say I am stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is non-medicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nicest vegetarian pizza I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude with the arugula.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to decide whether the herb
is, the pizza is medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it medicated Tim?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheesecake?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheesecake has arrived.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy times here.
[SPEAKER_06]: My cheesecake arrived as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mega ill pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just killer pizza, medicated pizza but
killer desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a non-medicated dessert but after
eating four pieces of medicated pizza and
[SPEAKER_06]: puffing many bowls of dry sift I think
this is gonna be perfect so super stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bon appetit there John.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weed guy has shown up at our table
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not rolling on that one Marie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay well first of all there is
regulations and that's number one it's
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna be 18 to get in here and number two
you have to have a doctor's diagnosis or
[SPEAKER_07]: federal exemption so I don't see what the
hell he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: He clearly didn't read the article or the
news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hit this rip on his behalf.
[SPEAKER_06]: One medication to another.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some sweet scum dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's smooth too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm gonna follow it up with one
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slide by the davicino there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude the davicino.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know like the like the light
[SPEAKER_07]: those little tiny pocket LED flashlights
save me many times in the bush when I'm
looking for something.
So useful.
