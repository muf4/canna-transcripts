[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World,
everyone, and another great episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a great Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Jonny B and our special guest,
Hippo, our friendly neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: glassblower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'll call you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the friendly neighborhood
glassblower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pretty much in my neighborhood,
so if you go into the city or if I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: up to Wiss, we usually make a point on
popping in on one another, so we're stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: to have you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How were things in the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good day in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick in and out, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went and checked out Puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Puff real quick dropped off some new
stuff, and then yeah, lunch, and then back
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they put that stuff in the stores,
or will that stuff go in on mail order,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will be available on their
online catalog, and a couple pieces that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just one-offs are going direct to the
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, so local puffs and then puffs online
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that website would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's puff.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can get ahold of those guys
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen Hippo's glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in one of our first glass show,
one of only two that I was ever a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: with Slinger, and hey, you were in the
first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, not only were you in the first
one, I'm almost certain your piece was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first piece to sell, which is pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being like, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, Jesse's going to be so
stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only to represent back then,
that was 10 or 11 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 freaking years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 04, is that what it was?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, how time flies when you're studying
feeding your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've got some yummy strawberries
and some melty hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I managed to clean your hash,
John, the hash that John and I made at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Champs show in Toronto, I guess a couple
weeks ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made a couple weeks, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I managed to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a med-tainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about maybe this much of the
med-tainer full, and I cleaned it into
[SPEAKER_00]: these three piles, and I'll photograph
them and insert the photographs for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys so you can see when I hold up the
lowest quality to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be showing you the macro photo of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the second grade,
which is a little bit more grainy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still actually pretty decent to vape,
to hit, and then the more, the meltiest of
[SPEAKER_00]: them all, the 90 plus percent gland heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking in this med-tainer and I
actually found some of the buds that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: lost that were from this batch in
particular that we ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all be looking at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dank right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Medi?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Medi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's perfumey.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a real nice perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your standard Kush smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's more like a Froot Loops
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something else in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like it's from Al or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is like a sweet skunk or a
congo, maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Al the Alchemist called it with my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a similar exotic sativa terpene in
there that's in this Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I picked up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something exotic in that,
but definitely... Maybe we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: trying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely stuck together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always run into you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've puffed myself every time I'm stomped
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we always run into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's almost like you're pulling them
in the cave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were driving down the freeway one time,
didn't I pass you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second, they went the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffs off because he also carries
meditators.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I'm always shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid in the candy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still working on them to sell bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry bolt bags right now,
but we'll get them on the bubble bag boat
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't understand those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw those the other day and it said a
220, a 73, and a 45 and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: so guaranteed nothing melts with a bolt
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the wall and I was like,
a three bag kit, what the... I know people
[SPEAKER_00]: ask me all the time, do you sell a three
bag kit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we had them on the website
for a while and then it was just slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: but surely it was like, I don't want to
have those anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard enough time selling a four
bag kit, which will at least ensure a
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality with that 160 bag in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about your buds that I just knocked
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a strike in bowling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just diving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurry up and finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta keep the dog safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog recently was picked up by the
local coyotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had him in his mouth, the back end
there and was shaking him around broad
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight down on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreo escaped because he's a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also been attacked by raccoons and
bitten in his trachea, punctured like 15
[SPEAKER_00]: times, got hit by a car, shattered his
left hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oreo is a survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I keep him on a literal short
leash these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad but he's basically locked on
this deck other than the locks we take him
[SPEAKER_00]: for before I gave him the freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately the freedom in this
neighborhood, it would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically potentially a death sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep him alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good little dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangin' my Jamaican plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 20 year old seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's doing lovely, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we've changed from this bowl from
the other bowl into this one, we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: whistle now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind that nickname, living so
close to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singing pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singing bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singing pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singing bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we managed to clean this up
nonetheless and get that exactly to a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbly melty tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sift before that was definitely not on
par compared to what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say we got a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely see the colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying when I put the buns next
to the dry sift, you can see the colors of
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes in there that were actually
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost like witness it by looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the one that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always partial to that best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also got this other bag here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, this is something to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you definitely hit this, this would not
melt at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, it's 20% hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be interesting to see what comes from
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So new works of art on the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now the time of summer so I can get
back into some fun work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a little bit of production
work to keep everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stores stocked and supplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I've got a couple weeks of free
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: New things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something just so epic and so awesome that
it's like, I'll have to put vids on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to break out my little black book
and go through my sketches and prioritize
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas that I've logged down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a couple good ideas that are
going around the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they materialize into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass Gathering up past Pemberton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's July.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's 3rd, 4th, 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out, the Birkin Glass Gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Canadian Glass Gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, the Great Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the 6th annual I believe this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been going for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great fun event for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody and everybody to come have a ton
of fun, watch some glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in our neighborhood here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the sea to sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful locale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of fun people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the pictures over the years and
I was going to make it up last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year we're going to be in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be in Jamaica this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hold it down for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there will be a bunch of videos
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Redbeard will film the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I guess there's sometimes
logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, just enjoying the fruit and
enjoying the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this hash in the back of my
fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't really find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 15 different containers in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to remember there's 73 many
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, haze is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we hit this nice little pipe
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his last name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all air trapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice little piece for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob hooked me up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the small pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the loaner he's lending me more
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my piece from Flav as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is quite a glass collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does collect a lot of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some nice pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would know them a lot more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, his collection is vast and
I'm not one to really be overly excited
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go to his house and have to hit
every one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just pick one or two and it's
usually like the Buck Marcel angler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like Singularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Chris Carlson Marcel collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any of his multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly hundreds of choices these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say I don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just go into his little spot and do
that one and that one and he's like okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Used to observe on the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always so much to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got together for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was life again got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some total life thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was totally supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to roll with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I cancel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life, the universe and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn that life and the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well sometimes it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us today, this moment right now,
which is really all you really have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no past or future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught up in living in the
future or living in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's why we like to hit bowls so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real like in the moment thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens up the mind that medicates me
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely inspires me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the Manny Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Manny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a chill day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It rained yesterday and the plants got
some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they reek.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the smell of the
Afghan just down the way here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see her down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghanja.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new name we should coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that Afghanja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just rank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now walking up and down this row right
here is just like a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keeping them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping them from getting too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like mothers that are six or seven
feet tall that are stripped four feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a keep them real short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind if the stalk gets big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the four foot guy that is getting
some inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah see everybody's got little different
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me I like things at the level where I
can work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say another good thing to sort of
interrupt is to replace like I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the biggest pots right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll replace those pots with a
slightly bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a way bigger one but just a slightly
bigger one and I'll do that for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know every 60 days and just
increase that pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows the roots to unbound and just to
kind of grow out a little bit and it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: them from I don't know over a long period
of time they seem to get real tight and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can lock themselves and gray out
and yeah then they kind of start they stop
[SPEAKER_00]: they start dying off parts of the roots
and just doesn't seem to be as healthy as
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can just I mean I know eventually
that idea is not gonna last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're gonna end up with a 55
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are talking about the air
rooting right now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to the air rooting so there's all
different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air layers you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the air with those geo pots where the
roots hit the outside of the pot and they
[SPEAKER_01]: hit the air and they rebut it and they
come back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're continuously growing in amongst
one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the pots they go down we seem to
circle or go against the edges that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know is when we transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I transplant moms after like
three years same thing it's just like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well can you imagine being in that one pot
for three years I kept one in the same pot
[SPEAKER_01]: for about five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah I'm saying give them a little
bit of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna learn maybe how to work on root
balls in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a mishap of doing a little bit of
work to one of my main moms of Medi Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: and ripped it out of the soil it almost
made me cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cut clones from it that was a couple
years ago and you know it's just like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like oh you keep that thing alive for
so long and then you make one stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: mistake you know it's dead but I was able
to you know take clones from it so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like third from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippo's equivalent is the smashed head
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just bald.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the like I only blow four of these a
year head piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't control what happens to you in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can control how you react to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To an extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say you can control your
cannabinoid intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I'd say we should be controlling that
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just loaded me up with a bowl so why
don't I load you up with a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of my Astro Boy fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just running my full plants right into the
bags and turned it into this ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: No trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No it's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the next generation of grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the grower that doesn't consider ever
selling my herb so it never has a monetary
[SPEAKER_00]: value to me like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real monetary value it has is
that I could compare it to how much it
[SPEAKER_00]: would cost if such a thing existed on the
open market which it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go buy fresh frozen 90 micron
Astro Boy nor can I go buy 99% pure You
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't find it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to learn how to do it yourself
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try this one Hippo?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah what we're talking about is yeah
that's the problem is these products are
[SPEAKER_01]: just not accessed because they're not
offered because they're looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of bud and how much money they get
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to learn how to do this and
that's the best part about these shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not you have to make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and not only that it's like because
people say this all the time I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need you know how I can access that
I don't live in a place it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically now is the time for people to
stand up for their rights to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this medicine whether they're using
it medicinally recreationally whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using it as a preventative a
curative whatever they're using it for
[SPEAKER_00]: they should have the rights to use it and
you the only way to really access this
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is to a grow your own and then be
extracted you know and then eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do that if you don't yet
understand the world of Hippo and his you
[SPEAKER_00]: know beautiful glass pieces that he makes
that's really in my opinion where that
[SPEAKER_00]: connection is understood where you start
understanding the time that it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these plants and the effort and the
love and then to extract the resin off and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you get this beautiful end product
that how could you smoke it through
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else other than a beautiful
hand-blown glass pipe blown by someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like Hippo who loves their art form and is
truly like coming from a heady place a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis connoisseur loves me because you
wouldn't be doing what you're doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: you love what you do everybody's got their
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's it man this is incredible to
me that you know all these patterns and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these colors it was blown and then I
went on to his Facebook Instagram and just
[SPEAKER_01]: like like yourself you have yes you could
just see the years of work and the passion
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gone into and then you can see the
evolving of the artist from everybody and
[SPEAKER_01]: they go hand in hand yeah I mean even with
yeah look at look at my hash look like
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago now it's only a year John it was
only a year no but years ago I never did
[SPEAKER_00]: this no no but even a year ago yeah your
bubble and dry sift compared to today is
[SPEAKER_00]: night and day night like dude today your
hash is as good as hash can be and then
[SPEAKER_00]: last year it was not it was more like this
believe it or not when you first brought
[SPEAKER_00]: your dry sift over like look at this you
can't have it now you look at this and go
[SPEAKER_00]: no way there's no way that was
[SPEAKER_00]: yours was more gold in color but it was
still the same 80% contaminant which you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and that's the first video John and I
ever did together if you want if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: back in my channel and you find the video
of the dry sifting it's in the dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: playlist and it's got the picture of the
few gland heads as the main front picture
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about a minute long it's just us
taking a rip of dry sift that's John's dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift that I cleaned for 45 minutes and
that was fire and the funny thing was is
[SPEAKER_01]: after we did the rip we had to knock the
cart and spill the rest and we laughed our
[SPEAKER_01]: heads off because we were so slow yeah
that was my fault it was it was an epic
[SPEAKER_01]: change for me I realized something so I
learned something I thought I never
[SPEAKER_01]: learned was actually how to actually truly
get the medical effects from my medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's one thing I've been talking
about ever since is really it's purify
[SPEAKER_01]: them it's purifying them and that's why
I'm able to actually lead a better quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of life every day and I'm not smoking big
heavy joints all the time now and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that it's it's so much easier to
medicate at the same time it's um it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more stealthy I got my trippy stick you
can do a rip and this is great I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: trippy stick would never replace this oh
and for me now it's all about glass it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about I grow organically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I can't you know this this nail
I can only hit on a pipe like this that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little porty if I'm home I want quartz
it seems to defeat the purpose to have
[SPEAKER_00]: such a nice glass pipe with a metal nail
on it if you don't have to I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little pipe like this and I have the same
nail on it there's no I mean it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to have a little mini quartz I guess
or ceramic haven't really seen Hive has
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceramic one but not in the 10 or 8 I
think theirs is like 14 18 yeah give it
[SPEAKER_00]: six months if that it won't take long well
there's a lot of different varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic so I don't know too too much about
it but Brian Schroeder from D Nail has
[SPEAKER_00]: given me a little bit of a lesson here and
there and he was just saying the price on
[SPEAKER_00]: true the ceramic that you would want is
just so outrageous for just a single nail
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's seemingly not feasible for from D
Nail's point of view whereas Mike from
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia or from Hive I should say I don't
know what he has to say about that yet but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to ask him about what he thinks
you know the differences in the price
[SPEAKER_00]: range and the quality it's a difficult one
when you're inhaling off something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I feel good about the quartz you know
the first time I hit quartz has to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 15 years ago when I hit the
volatizer the volatizer was a vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a wand and it had a quartz bowl
and I remember the first thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that was different about it was
the way the oils recondensed in the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: of this bowl because I also had a Vriptec
gun at the same time and that glass one
[SPEAKER_00]: which was basically doing the same thing
except with forced air it was producing
[SPEAKER_00]: red oil in the stem the volatizer was
producing clear oil in the stem and the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that the what I figured that was was
because the glass one the stem got warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: heated those oils and turned them that CBN
red color the quartz the way it dissipates
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is unbelievable so if you heat up the
top of the quartz bowl even this quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl right here isn't hot right here and
it only starts to get hot I mean it's warm
[SPEAKER_00]: right here but I mean that's unbelievable
man if this was titanium my fingers would
[SPEAKER_00]: be sizzled you know what I mean it's just
not cold down here and I like that about
[SPEAKER_00]: the quartz that I can lift it up off the
pipe you know I can I can basically deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with it while it's still wicked hot you
cannot do that with a titanium so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just my ramble you know clearly
baked we're enjoying ourselves on this
[SPEAKER_00]: well well medicated I'm not sure what the
sound in the background I was thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be a bolt I thought it was a
plane but now it seems more like a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: blower anyway we're not hung up on the
sound if you guys aren't we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: and chill for a little bit off-camera but
hope you guys have enjoyed this segment
