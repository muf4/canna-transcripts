[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what kind of gauntlet would that be
if I forgot to hit the Nate Dizzle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hit the mothership, hit the two roars,
hit the Sheldon Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got baked and forgot the Swiss
Perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it has only been a few minutes,
so...
[SPEAKER_00]: What shall we... I say nice and easy
transfer with the D, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to grab the quartz by the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wicked hot bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just see how easy it is to really
snag off the other bong and put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Swiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm thinking the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish it off with some Fumel heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the D420K Sift from PG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned it up a little bit, because it
was pretty darn clean, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't have to clean up much,
but I did a little bit, and it's wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome taste on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so, for real this time,
thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
you you
