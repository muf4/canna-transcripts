[SPEAKER_07]: Even just from five minutes ago,
I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, they're changing on the fly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here in the backseat of Prezzy's car,
and we're going to the Dub Club.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct, Prezzy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're with Ernie.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chili's in the front.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to check out a little Kingston
authentic Dub Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Sunday night on the Jax Hill Top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every Sunday night on the Jax Hill Top.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just right in front of the Jax
Hill Top, so this is going to be a pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: quick little trip for us to get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little jaunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we just go around the
mountain, down and around and up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect, Prezzy, perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Alpha?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to drive here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it looks like we've decided to turn
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to drive the other way,
up Jax Hill, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You turn in, and the adventure begins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we've jumped out here because
there's a really nice view of the city
[SPEAKER_07]: right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingston down below.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the dogs barking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of animals are barking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overlooking the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overlooking the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to go to Jax Hill,
get some dab, enjoy some dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real, authentic Jamaican music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good food, and just leave it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving through the jungle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we're right on Jax Hill here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Made it around.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have to say about that,
Prezzy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good vibes, a good vibration of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day, three days after the election,
things are getting right back to normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't have time for politics
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, we're just getting back in
the groove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone going to work, people going to
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to move on, hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things just change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skyline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cuddle of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always stoked to be in Kingston and on our
way to the Dub Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time here at the Dub Club,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: For certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: For what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel sick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Forward ever, backward never, I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that parking spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guy worked us over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, imagine being this guy that parked
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not leaving until the end.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in it to win it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in it to win it, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: One by one.
[SPEAKER_05]: One by one.
One by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going out?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dub Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're buying a whole bunch of keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: For our collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, we're on Bubble Man's World right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice one, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh baby, something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was all these dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That don't quite feel the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deliver I and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the wicked and the lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reserve I and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come and see what's dipping out the pocket
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is going to be a buzz for the
guys, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, which one's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jorge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your bubble man.

[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?
What's up, man?
What's up, man?
What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's chilly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about that, pal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play one more and we'll
drop for the band called Anton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, come on, come on, come on,

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just finishing off the evening here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured I'd finish off that little dub
club jam with a bong ripper, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got all sorts of wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ernie and Chilly are taking off tomorrow,
so it's just me and Ashley for the next
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of days, and then he's taking off
and I'm on my own for a week after that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be cruising around to Westmoreland
and looking for some fine herbs to make
[SPEAKER_07]: hash out of, as always.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, why don't we do a
little dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking super tangy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super tangy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super tangy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, that's on point right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make sure this doesn't get up much
higher than 580.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do some low temps tangy dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you could really feel the
authenticity of that event tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really nice to see Kittis Eye,
see Callie P, see Exile the Brave,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just a whole bunch of great people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamilia we saw, Jamila, Chinas Smith's
daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so hopefully we'll link up with her
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just the beginning of the
videos here in Kingston this round.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been able to do many.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a hash church and a couple
periscopes, but I wanted to give you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple of authentic videos from
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this will be the first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we have a dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: I love those 2 a.m.
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pure oranges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna head over to Negril.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the next couple of days, I'm gonna go
check out the Stepping Hot Festival.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the full flyer right here,
so some good friends right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got
[SPEAKER_07]: King Charlo, Young Jr., Empress Minot,
we got Loyal Flames, we got Chinas Smith,
[SPEAKER_07]: we got Tough Like Iron, Ake Becca from
Midnight, and what else we got?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Third Gear and Callie P. We bumped
into Callie P tonight at the Dub Club.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are all gonna be great artists
that we'll be able to catch down at the
[SPEAKER_07]: Stepping High Festival.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's the 13th annual one,
2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning, and I'm gearing up to go
to bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys for watching this video,
and we'll catch you next time on Above
[SPEAKER_07]: Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace.
See you next time.
