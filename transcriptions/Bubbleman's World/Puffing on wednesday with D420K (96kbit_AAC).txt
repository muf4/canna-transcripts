[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man here with D420K, hitting the
apex pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out on the motorcycles today,
enjoying a fucking beautiful British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbian afternoon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that apex pen treating you,
D?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full size Rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For an electronic pen, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a nice hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely one of the nice options of
this particular pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a lot of a nice D-nail rip
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking... How are you liking the
D-nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need to get a few other things
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of whips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once they're more in Canada and
people are buying them more and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll get more popular and they'll be
more accessible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little hard to get some of the
parts, but... Yeah, I think so,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it all works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the goods, you'll wait for the
goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we just wanted to share a little
bowl with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of videos in the queue
that I've got to upload, but I forgot
[SPEAKER_01]: every once in a while I can say hi to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a puffy Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Puff Wednesday and... Yeah,
it is Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
