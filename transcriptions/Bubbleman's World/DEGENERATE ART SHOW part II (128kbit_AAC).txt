[SPEAKER_08]: And we are here with Bubble Man,
the man who's responsible for all of this
[SPEAKER_08]: madness here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why the hell did you take this crazy
project on, Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of a hard question
to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a year and a half in the making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, this space was originally supposed
to be a space for my manager to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: office, if you could believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I needed for the bubble bag
company, a small little office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a beach in Jamaica, I had a friend
call me and say, I found this space for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I&I, I&I Commercial Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 1111 Commercial Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sitting on a beach in Jamaica,
thinking that I could just be sitting and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying the bubble bag thing for the next
10 or 20 years and watching my kids play
[SPEAKER_00]: on the beach thinking, you know,
maybe I should start more projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should maybe I should give back
more to the community rather than just try
[SPEAKER_00]: and hoard for myself and sort of undertook
this project of getting this space,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to turn it into something new that
isn't easily categorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I always had the idea of
making it a gallery space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this really was our the birth of
our gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here a year and a half and this
was our first show and it was the birth of
[SPEAKER_00]: The Melting Point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't think of a better theme to
have to start have started us out with.
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell me what the intention was in
bringing all of these glass artists and
[SPEAKER_08]: their work together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you want to do that specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's directly related to a
relationship I have with Marbleslinger,
[SPEAKER_00]: the glassblower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and him have been talking about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, we've talked about this
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a year ago, in combination with me
getting this space and not knowing a name
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these different things over a year
ago now, there was a showdown in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco at a gallery called The Melting
Point Gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was a pipe show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't able to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed down in the U.S.,
but I saw pictures and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: video of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the name inspired me so much that
I called the gallery Melting Point
[SPEAKER_00]: Gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big part of the inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just my relationship with
Marbleslinger and the last few years have
[SPEAKER_00]: just been sort of on a collision course
for this event to have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was he was my inspiration and
I think I was kind of his inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really wanted to show the people up
here that there's an entire community of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that we don't know about because
there's this border that keeps us divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not allowed to go down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid to come up here because
they feel that when they go to the border,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're offering themselves up to
the chopping block, even when they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that that was kind of our
inspiration right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first event of its kind in
Canada, which is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not everywhere in Canada at
all times, but I haven't heard of such an
[SPEAKER_00]: event happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, honestly, I'm a glass
collector and I know a lot about the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these pieces blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The themes, the concepts, the
construction.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so here's the tough question,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is your favorite piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, almost impossible to answer because
there are so many different themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like so many different pieces
in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: For so many different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first piece to to come in was the
Jason Lee, which was the that incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: motorcycle piece that was actually a combo
of of Jason Lee and Steve Hopps,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe was his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did an absolutely outstanding
job, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was the first piece to show up
and we opened it up and we see this this
[SPEAKER_00]: motorcycle and it just blew the top of
everyone's heads off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made us realize that this show is going
to be impeccable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also the amber piece, the DJ right
behind us here, the DJ and the break
[SPEAKER_00]: dancer is just I mean, it doesn't you
know, words don't even need to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to see a little bit of a
picture of it or see it in in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the jewelry added on to the to
the pieces and little things like gluing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny curly strap from the headphone
down to the turntable, every detail was
[SPEAKER_00]: was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that piece a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You totally successfully wiggled out of my
very tough question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to ask it again in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could choose one of these pieces to
add to your collection as a smoking device
[SPEAKER_08]: is something that you're inhaling your
favorite resin through.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll narrow the categories a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as a puffing piece, which one would you
choose to add to your personal collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, that is so difficult to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's multiple pieces that the
Max piece is so impressive to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you really you hold that in your
hand and you feel that you could really
[SPEAKER_00]: take over a small third world country with
that pipe, like a like a gauntlet holding
[SPEAKER_00]: it up in front of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it could be the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, the the amber, the the Max,
there's there's so many that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to choose a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, Jason Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artists all did an impeccable job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if I had the cash,
I'd buy every single one of them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a pipe party where we would
hit every single one of them if I had my
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think was the greatest success
of the opening of the show last night?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just, you know,
the artists showing up and really being
[SPEAKER_00]: positively pumped to have a venue to be
able to display their art, which is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminalized industry down in America
where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we really topped it off with
the living raw foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the outside access with the fire
twirlers like it just seemed to always
[SPEAKER_00]: keep getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I didn't even plan it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like a lot of it was planned by
my manager, Dandy and Aaron had
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all component components that were
compartmentalized almost up to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end where we just sort of went click,
click, click, click, click, click,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Lego and put them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone did their part and played
their part impeccably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what made it go off as
well as it did.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple of people have used the word
movement around this art.
[SPEAKER_08]: And can you explain to me what that means
to you in terms of this art and these pipe
[SPEAKER_08]: making artists being a part of a movement?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we moving towards?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we moving from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what I think we're really
this pipe art is really sort of a front
[SPEAKER_00]: line for cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of these guys have been
inspired by cannabis, but they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to come out of the closet with it
because down in America, just admitting
[SPEAKER_00]: that, condemns your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in a place where they need to
make their decisions based on fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of the word movement is
to try and remove fear from your emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary, step up out of the fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, I mean, man, these guys
are making these pieces every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds ridiculous to you guys out
there, but literally they can get arrested
[SPEAKER_00]: and thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be fined thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can spend months in jail for blowing
glass pipes that have no traces of resin
[SPEAKER_00]: in them, but merely for sending it over an
imaginary line that was just put up to
[SPEAKER_00]: divide us just to create more division,
just to fill jails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's neat that Canada bordering America
can be the venue for these guys to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very much the same for the modern
artists who were fleeing Germany in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nazi Germany time in 37 in Berlin,
fleeing into Amsterdam and having these
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible squats, these huge art
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few old ones in Amsterdam that
have famous names, but these people were
[SPEAKER_00]: fleeing there to just save themselves and
save their art.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that these guys make pipes is an
expression of their freedom and it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: condemned where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime you do that, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the word movement comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a movement and they've got to lift
themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what I want to do with all this is
I want to stop the divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We constantly divide ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as a community of pipe blowers,
we can divide ourselves and put ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: into little balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just like to break the bubbles,
get things out into the mainstream and
[SPEAKER_00]: show people that this really is art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You did a fabulous job.
[SPEAKER_08]: And next year?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we get to have it again next year?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this going to be an annual event?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start planning it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely want to have panels of glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make it maybe even a two-day
event, but we'll definitely have a gallery
[SPEAKER_00]: show that will top this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So blowers out there, you can start
working on your pieces for next year's
[SPEAKER_08]: show.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start working on your pieces, guys and
girls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcel, thanks for sticking around a
little bit so that we could chat today,
[SPEAKER_08]: the day after.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to start by you telling me about
this insanely beautiful piece here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me exactly what it is and what it
means to you and anything else that you
[SPEAKER_08]: want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: This piece is called Arternity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it in 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can see the tag here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, an artistic cycle describing the
evolution of a medium from its inception
[SPEAKER_02]: through necessary function to a pure
expression for its own sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of about human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time humans get a hold of a
technology, it's usually just a matter of
[SPEAKER_02]: time before they turn it towards artistic
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some technologies actually get turned
to a point where the artistic expression
[SPEAKER_02]: is the primary purpose of utilizing the
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what this piece is
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this sand and people from sand,
they started working with glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And glass was a natural for preserving
food and for making bowls and functional
[SPEAKER_02]: objects of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so moving through that, people started
making these functional objects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they started decorating them to
make them fancier and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, at some point with glass,
the function became the decoration rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than the vessel in the first place or the
glass article.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this is about is it's like,
there's all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a goblet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a distilling apparatus for a
pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you can also take the same medium
and make this thing that has no purpose
[SPEAKER_02]: other than to communicate or to fulfill my
fancy as a maker.
[SPEAKER_08]: And who is this creature?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say that it's so much of a who.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of a phoenix rising sort
of an entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an energy creature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a being.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that it is personality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you started a project like this,
did you already have a vision in mind of
[SPEAKER_08]: what it was going to turn out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or does it get a life of its own and grow
into something other than what you thought
[SPEAKER_08]: it was going to between start and finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I usually do is I just I come up with
an idea, like something I want to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: it before I come up with a form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this piece, I was interested in
kind of conveying an idea before I was
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in making a form per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can be a harder way to go
because you have to come up with this
[SPEAKER_02]: thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that's worth spending
all this time because it takes it took us
[SPEAKER_02]: three months and thousands of dollars to
be able to make this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to take all that time and all that
energy and just do something that might
[SPEAKER_02]: that doesn't really have anything behind
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't it doesn't seem worth it to
take all that time and energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always try and have an idea going
before we even start melting glass and
[SPEAKER_02]: usually before we even start drawing form.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stunning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_08]: That you spent the time and the resources
because it's totally mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So last night was a pretty amazing night.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering as an artist what the
significance of last night was to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was definitely a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it's really nice to get
this piece out and have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have people see it and appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the art has to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not seen, then it's just might as
well not exist in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every opportunity I get to get it
out there and have people experience it
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that I do or part, you know,
start to have that experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really I like to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have people get that chance to
to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for bringing this beast up in
your in your homeland down there and you
[SPEAKER_08]: know what to us as Canadian seems like,
you know, the land of darkness,
[SPEAKER_08]: although I know there are some very bright
spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has the environment that you work in
changed significantly with, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: Ashcroft and all of the sort of bad guy
crackdown on the on the pipes programs
[SPEAKER_08]: that's happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it a little bit further out there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you feeling the impacts in your work
and in your environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, you know, honestly,
it's a really long term thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't feel that there's been this
like huge shift in the recent past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things happened and some people
were their businesses were confiscated and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were taken to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's also something that's been
going on steadily in states and around
[SPEAKER_02]: other other countries for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more a matter of a cycle of this
because it's a gray area and because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a semi black market, it has just
sort of a mixed bag of attributes that are
[SPEAKER_02]: in some ways helpful to the independent
artists and some ways not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for instance, one of the things
that's really helpful about it being semi
[SPEAKER_02]: black market is that no, there aren't
corporations with a lot of money to just
[SPEAKER_02]: walk in and take over the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, with a clothing company
like, for instance, Seedless, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: the Seedless company and they're making
all their clothes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, a company with overseas
connections to have all this stuff made
[SPEAKER_02]: can walk in and just either try and
forcibly buy the company and take over
[SPEAKER_02]: that brand and turn it into like part of
the corporate juggernaut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with the glass pipes, that's much
harder to do because of the legal issues
[SPEAKER_02]: that company with that much to lose and
that much investment can never take that
[SPEAKER_02]: course of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not going to happen the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of leaves room for the legal
guy for the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a mixed thing that it's
hard to really like completely... I just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like to have a totally negative
outlook on it, on anything for that
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the opportunities and just about
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, because the world is messed up
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you have to just look at
what is really there and capitalize on
[SPEAKER_02]: what's there, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long have you been blowing glass
floor altogether?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in that time, you have invested
yourself into a huge amount of art and
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible pieces that have now been
spread out in the world that are often
[SPEAKER_08]: other people's homes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there was one piece that you've
made that's made its way out there in the
[SPEAKER_08]: world that you could have back,
which one would it be and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one piece that I would like to have
back never actually left my possession.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've still got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very good forward thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the FISH 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it for the FISH show that they had
at Big Cypress in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a New Year's show and it was about,
I forget how many people were there,
[SPEAKER_02]: 40,000 people or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got there and it was the first
piece where I'd been working on these
[SPEAKER_02]: other pieces that are around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some pieces from that time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about 1999.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold it nice and still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this piece was built in 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first I was numbering these fancy
aquatic pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, I'd been experimenting with
large scale stuff for maybe half a year or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, but I was really kind of
holding my punches on the pattern work a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit because they're so risky to
make.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technical process of joining so many
parts was difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to have minimum amount of work
in the pieces so that when they broke,
[SPEAKER_02]: which they did on a regular basis,
it wouldn't be such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got confident with the
construction, I started making these
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger and elaborately decorated pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that one over there is number one in
the case and then this one here is number
[SPEAKER_02]: three.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, at the end of 99,
I decided to make Fish 2000 and I'd seen
[SPEAKER_02]: my first fish show earlier that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after my first fish show, I was all
stoked on this band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, these guys are just great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what they're doing with the crowd
and with the energy and getting everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I spent like a month trying to
figure out how to make a glass piece that
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to represent this thing that I
had seen, this concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was like this long process of
all kinds of like couch meditations and
[SPEAKER_02]: just like really, I spent all this time
thinking about it and finally came up with
[SPEAKER_02]: the design and executed this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I barely finished it in time
to get on the plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally warm in my suitcase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been scheduled to go home to my
parents' house for Christmas and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't get on the plane to go there
because I had to finish this piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it ended up being a cluster of
dolphins spiraling around each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's five, six dolphins in it,
plus a bunch of fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bubbler that hangs on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really terrible that I don't have it
or a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably supply a picture for you
if you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dolphins are, each dolphin is
decorated with a different color of
[SPEAKER_02]: dichroic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're joined and they're
dancing in front of a spiral that has five
[SPEAKER_02]: different colors of dichroic.
[SPEAKER_02]: One for each dolphin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're spiraling together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dolphins that are hooked together,
the sections that are hooking each dolphin
[SPEAKER_02]: together is that same spiraled tube stock
with each of the five colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of the energies is represented
going through as these dolphins are
[SPEAKER_02]: spinning around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going through, I mean it was just
amazing at the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just puffing that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we got to the fish show and there
was no, no one had anything to relax with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no herb anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just ended up being this crazy puff
session the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea how many people experienced
that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it must have been a thousand at least.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you hung on to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that piece not up here because it's
been used?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you didn't want to bring it across
the border?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not up here because there wasn't time
for me to prepare it to cross the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean it's definitely,
plus it's become so valuable to me that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's crossing international borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that can't be done in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I'm scared of it,
but you know you have to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is next for you?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know like this piece here seems to me
like it would represent sort of a pinnacle
[SPEAKER_08]: thus far in your path as an artist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have ideas of where you want to go
next?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I just keep wanting to make more of
these large pieces and installations and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really looking for I have some ideas
to make some pieces with several figures
[SPEAKER_02]: or sentinels like this size in like
arrangements to fill a space or cover a
[SPEAKER_02]: room or something like a different thought
about making a piece with a like I see
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys as kind of like sentinels or
warriors or you know people entities that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in doing battle or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of want to like arrange some of
these guys with like you know in a line
[SPEAKER_02]: like a formation and then have like the
black hordes of like you know scorpions
[SPEAKER_02]: and just like worms and you know I've been
doing some really like dark experimental
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff with like really buggy looking forms
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of want to bring them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Together the dark and the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well thank you for your incredible work
and for taking your time this morning and
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully you'll come up to Vancouver and
play some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you make it up here once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that crazy piece in there that you blew
I've never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the inspiration behind that beast
and what do you call it and what is it and
[SPEAKER_08]: tell me a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well I make a lot of pieces that are
similar to that and I guess I kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: think of them as some kind of like a
lightning storm or a thunderstorm type of
[SPEAKER_11]: theme.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think my inspiration is probably just
growing up in the northwest and you know I
[SPEAKER_11]: feel like my glass is kind of a
representation of a you know like the
[SPEAKER_11]: nature and all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it's kind of how I see the world
put into glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess that's part of the inspiration
at least.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long does it take to create something
like that and how many hours of work are
[SPEAKER_08]: we talking about there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say there's roughly like a hundred
hours in there but there's time you know
[SPEAKER_11]: there's sitting and waiting or you know
time that it takes to heat up.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can only hold a piece that big for a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know it took me about two weeks
from start to finish doing 10 hour days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how does it puff?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you smoke out of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it smoke well?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it more of a looker?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a hundred percent functional but you
know it's also just an art piece.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it's never been smoked and.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little easier to travel over
international borders to get it into shows
[SPEAKER_08]: that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is easier.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know FedEx likes it better when it's
clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is it for you being a glassblower in
America now that you're starting to turn
[SPEAKER_08]: into Mordor down there?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you're in like the land of the
dark and oppressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that glassblowers are potentially
under a hell of a lot more pressure and
[SPEAKER_08]: facing a lot more risk than they used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that for you in your world and how
has it changed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what are the risks that you're facing
now compared to what you were a year ago
[SPEAKER_08]: or two years ago?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well you know it's just a lot different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I don't think there were any
potential risks.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it was a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I guess there's certain states and
even federally people are saying it's
[SPEAKER_11]: illegal to make paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is kind of absurd.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I view what we do as something
beyond just paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know if you look at a lot of the pipes
and especially the pipe that you were just
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about I think you know it's beyond
a functional level of art glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that would not be marketed
to children.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it's things that you know it's
something that you would see in a
[SPEAKER_11]: stockbroker's house or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are the actual risks now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or sort of not so much the risks but the
threats of what they could do to
[SPEAKER_08]: glassblowers?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I hate to dig for the skin in these
stories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like do you know any stories of
glassblowers that have been sort of facing
[SPEAKER_08]: nasty things recently?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never personally met a glassblower
that's gotten in trouble for blowing
[SPEAKER_11]: glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least in Washington state you have to
you know intend it as paraphernalia for it
[SPEAKER_11]: to be considered paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's kind of a fine line I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know a lot of police in Washington
have seen glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know and not confiscated it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know they appreciate it as art.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you know the laws passed by you
know the administration in the states
[SPEAKER_11]: right now and Ashcroft you know it's a
it's not something that represents the
[SPEAKER_11]: country as a whole.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it's a it's a small minority that
thinks that way and they happen to be the
[SPEAKER_11]: ones that have the power at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you had your pieces in a show like
this before?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a proper art show?
[SPEAKER_11]: No this is the most properly I'd say
they've ever been displayed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most galleries in the states are afraid to
bring in something that could be construed
[SPEAKER_11]: as paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah this is the first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's fabulous to have all of you
guys brought in from all over and all
[SPEAKER_08]: these incredible headpieces and you know
showing them off to the public like you
[SPEAKER_08]: know that you're artists because you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome hope you have a fabulous time
in Vancouver and keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been an incredible night here at the
Melting Plate listening to jazz,
[SPEAKER_07]: talking on rap, rock, and talking to some
of these incredible artists that are so
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful to actually be showcased as
artists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for tuning in and after a
month long hiatus we'll be back in action
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So till then take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You resign yourself, resign yourself.
Oh at the end, oh at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're here with Chris and Amethyst,
art maker and art lover.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think of what you saw today
in all those glass boxes?
[SPEAKER_06]: The drummer and the break dancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: The drummer and the break dancer is very
cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the cool one hanging on the
wall?
[SPEAKER_08]: There was kind of like a head with flowers
coming out of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: No?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll go look at that one afterwards
because if you like the break dancers you
[SPEAKER_08]: might like that one too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this guy made it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know him?
[SPEAKER_06]: He hang out a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah that's a buddy of yours?
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know this guy does this glass
blowing thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever seen him do it?
[SPEAKER_08]: No?
[SPEAKER_08]: No?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: So okay you can go if you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to stay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay so that piece that you made in there
is incredible and I'm sure that you hear
[SPEAKER_08]: that all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just have to lean in and share a mic
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your pieces are really different than a
lot of what else is out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't seem to have the pipe drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me just a little bit about
like what's your shtick?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your passion?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the thing that motivates you to
make what you make?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you make it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten questions in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Bellingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Amethyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in Bellingham and I work at a
shop in town and I live in town and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: a tight little community of friends and in
my shop we have like kind of really good
[SPEAKER_01]: group people and so right now I'm at this
spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you part of Amber's Harem?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: No?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not in that collective?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Brock Marvel and Scott Deppey and
I've got Evan Barrow and Johnny Sternberg
[SPEAKER_01]: and Kaisa Merak and myself and it's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like six of us in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know some of those other guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim Cook.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all your buddies?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely one.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your dad?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one's your dad?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Ivan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in a good group right now and I'm
just in a good spot and I'm having fun and
[SPEAKER_01]: my work is, I don't know, that piece in
particular I drew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just drawing some like real rough
sketches and I really don't, I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: really offer much explanation for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that I made and I
worked through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably was about a month in the
making just like different parts that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: make and I knew it was all coming
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know exactly how but it was like
a real rough sketch and then made parts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so stunning.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's totally stunning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you find that there's a market for your
non-smokable pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one pipe that I have in here is the
second like real pipe that I've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second bubbler that I've made and
I made it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't really have a market as is
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a market at all selling pipes
because I don't make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sell a lot of vessels and some
sculpture that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly like, mostly vessels of different
different cane worked sections and like I
[SPEAKER_01]: make teapots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make teaballs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make teapots that you can put on the
stove and boil water with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make wine glasses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I make... I wish that we had a teapot of
yours here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to see you in your teapot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll probably happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll probably happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to... I'm working on finding more
venues to show my work and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about this gallery and this show
in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really for me to kind of to be in this
is it's a little bit it's different
[SPEAKER_01]: because like it's a movement that's been
happening for a little while and just like
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just in this show because I
made a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool and I'm really I'm really
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah it seems to be sort of a common theme
that everybody's really thrilled to be
[SPEAKER_08]: showcased as an artist rather than next to
the rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much like it's long overdue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really deserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening in here is an underground
art movement that's just now like starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to get attention and it's gaining
momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing and the world is just
ready to see this as something else and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know maybe it won't ever get like
really large mainstream attention but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna happen anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so too and I think your work is
absolutely incredible and I hope you come
[SPEAKER_08]: and play in Vancouver some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you live in Bellingham too?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are you gonna come and play in
Vancouver some more?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you had any fun here yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah you've had some fun?
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you come back and visit some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say happy Canada Day for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Canada Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where all the action goes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where all the goodies are made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get a piece?
[SPEAKER_02]: No but I'd love one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: The newbies are taking over this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody told me it was going to be this
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought an ice pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of a bitch melted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an ice pipe right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I grab a stock of celery over there?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first met Bubble Man, it was an
incredible $20 shelf with $20,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_05]: glass on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first glass collector.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I ever heard the name Jason
Lee.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I heard the name Marbleslinger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started seeing these pieces and
understood that this was a collectible
[SPEAKER_05]: medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: This wasn't just in your local head shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know you guys are creating a whole
new genre as you go along with this art
[SPEAKER_05]: form.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just in the head shops anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collectors are coming on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first real brick and mortar
indication you've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I've seen is getting all these pieces
in one place together to really drive it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is going to be the first of
many.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys see a lot more of it than we live
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: From my perspective, seeing all these
pieces in one time together, you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to see this written up in different
articles.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see it show up in
different places.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to generate just the vibe and
that hype.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to generate more people saying,
I can buy this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can collect this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people out there who want
money that will spend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the background picture of Marcel
looking at guns.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, that's pretty perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to go talk to them while they're
holding those guns.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for talking.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with these guns?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to point at anybody in a bad
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the entire deal though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the best parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see how uncomfortable I've already
made you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the idea you were saying about
the smoking gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of your statement there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Bruce's other buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I put my mouth on a fucking gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see that thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way this one fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did you make a glass gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: To make people uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you make that more as an art piece or
more as just a functional pipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a performance piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You put weed in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: How does the performance part of it work?
[SPEAKER_10]: You shoot yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's interesting the way people
handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the performance involved?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to shoot it at your buddies and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gun your friends down before turning the
weapon on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that have to do with smoking?
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that have to do with herbs and
smoking?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why a gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you gunning your friends down with
a pipe?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is it a pipe?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you need that part of the
performance?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's not a pipe you won't stick
it in your mouth and you won't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: discomfort associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like watching people do an obviously
morbid suicidal act.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not a dildo then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe she said it was killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A dildo would work too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll make one of those in the next.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask you, Ham, about your motivation
behind Rebirth Through Scavenger Tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with that piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the story or what?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with that piece?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pipe?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a sculpture?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a scavenger tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's found a pile of somebody's forgotten
dead bones and it's consuming them hungry
[SPEAKER_03]: and greedily and it's eating its bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, bones are cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no guilt associated with these
bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tree didn't kill anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a scavenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But through its consumption of the bones,
it's causing the regrowth of the man whose
[SPEAKER_03]: bones it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the guy's trying to break free.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's struggling to get out of the very
thing that's leading to his rebirth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what about the bowl and the carve and
the mouthpiece and the fact that you can
[SPEAKER_10]: smoke out of it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why make that sculpture a pipe to express
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: What does the pipe aspect have to do with
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it meant to function?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ceremony.
[SPEAKER_10]: What about these other pieces?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those pieces are old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember those pieces.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of that Jason Lee piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is it cool though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a thing, not just a pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me answer your question.
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of you expressing yourself
through glass, why bother making pipes?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why bother?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why a pipe?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to exchange, if you want to
pass stuff around, why not make it a
[SPEAKER_10]: goblet?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that the function?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because who else is so enthusiastic about
pool glass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Than people who want to buy pipes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who else is so enthusiastic?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how did you get into blowing glass?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of pipes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I saw something at a county fair
or something when I was like 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew that I was going to blow glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when did you start blowing glass?
[SPEAKER_10]: When was the first time you ever put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little butane torch once when I
was about 16 or something or 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I tried to melt some glass and it
didn't go well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I bought a welding torch from a
welding store when I was like 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxygen tank and a pair of snot grass
special $50 water glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snot grass glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snot grass specials, yeah, $50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Six years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1998.
[SPEAKER_10]: Went home and started melting some glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like... When did you break your
first pipe?
About then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pipes were just happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was a good... Had you seen anyone
else blow glass before you actually went
[SPEAKER_10]: out?
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw someone you were leavening at.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I started blowing glass in Corvallis
and all the other cool Corvallis guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead of me all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right about the time I was starting to
blow glass they all left to move up to
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it was like me alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you could blow cool glass because
you know like the Mobius shop and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was nobody there to show me how
to blow cool glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hear shit like sticky wire in there
and trying to like melt rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I met you along... I worked in
that 49th Street shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: That Mobius shop for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember meeting you when you came out
once and you knew Jason really.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know you at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: The piece you brought up then was so much
more standard compared to your work now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was more like you were trying to text.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like double layered inside out I
think or something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to remember what that piece
looked like.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked to see these.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do you think is coming next?
[SPEAKER_10]: This like Operation Pipetrain scare you
away at all from making glass?
[SPEAKER_10]: It change anything for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: No?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you mostly sell your work?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know yet.
