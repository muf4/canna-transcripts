Dude!
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright!
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world!
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great birthday it's been!
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Flav show up with epic glass,
so he's here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do a gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: John B's still in the house from our fresh
frozen session earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some good friends of mine,
Kai and Shannon, who are just up the road
[SPEAKER_05]: in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just stopped in!
I know!
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, yo!
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess what we've decided,
Flav has brought this epic gauntlet of...
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why don't you tell them what we
got, starting with the piece in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: Shannon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we got on the far side of
Cory, Mothership Fabulous Client Taurus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a collab between Alex Ubituba,
Pantitun Widgwag, and Scott Deppie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up we have the Cory Goddess Tube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute spectacular colors on this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the white.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wings, that light green color,
and the intricate radicella work on the
[SPEAKER_05]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a beautiful piece all around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quality, craftsmanship, and really a nice
piece to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: This piece is an enjoyment through and
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Honey Queen, which is a Banjo
Joe Peters collab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this piece is incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even explain to you the quality of
this piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Video and photos really don't do it
justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of water that fits in the
bottom chamber is the tiniest,
[SPEAKER_05]: tiniest little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gives the most incredible rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole back end of the pipe,
when you turn it around, all the dripping
[SPEAKER_05]: honey that's dripping over the Honey
Queen's chair from the top of the bowl is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually a recycler.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got it covered in these little
bees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have these amazing patterns inside of
honey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honeycombs, and the whole dripping honey
up through the base, as you climb up
[SPEAKER_05]: through the top, that is the recycler.
[SPEAKER_05]: That big bar of dripping honey goes up and
loops around under the bee, and that is
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the recycler.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thumbs up to Joe Peters and Banjo for
this absolute stunner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up we have the Cory Skull piece with
the Brain Perk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reminiscent of the Scott Deppie skull
piece from some years ago, Cory put his
[SPEAKER_05]: own style on it, really added some
intricate colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very unique, although you cannot see
the bowl as you're puffing out of this
[SPEAKER_05]: piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mouthpiece is at the bottom base neck
of the skull and the bowl is up through
[SPEAKER_05]: the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first glance you really don't realize
how beautiful the work on this piece is
[SPEAKER_05]: until you get in through the sides and you
look at that Brain Perk.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tightness of his wraps, and it's just
really quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful piece to hold,
and it's an absolute beautiful piece to
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say it's one of the most
unique pieces I've ever smoked,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have smoked out of quite a few
pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're happy to have the Cory Brain Perk
skull piece here for the birthday bash
[SPEAKER_05]: gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well last but certainly not least we have
the Marcel Braun Chris Carlson collab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that air trapping work by Marcel,
and look at that basket weave done by
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Carlson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute stunner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Marcel marble on the one side and
Carlson marble on the other side.
[SPEAKER_05]: This piece hits like an absolute champ.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love its simplicity, yet when you look
at it closely you kind of can't believe
[SPEAKER_05]: how intricate it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So simplicity and intricacy all wrapped up
into one for absolute wicked rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorites by far.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always such a mouthful to explain who
blew these pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it epic?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not going to talk about the
different perks of such.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but we're going to hit them all and
we're going to do a basically like boom
[SPEAKER_05]: boom boom boom boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the one thing that we have to
figure out is that the two D-nails will
[SPEAKER_05]: require quick dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can give them a quick kind of,
I'll sort of hold this, we'll start with
[SPEAKER_05]: them, that way you can lean over without
going too far.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can lean from right there and load
both of them, then that way once they've
[SPEAKER_05]: done their hit, we'll go right to John,
we'll have him preloaded, we'll have me
[SPEAKER_05]: preloaded, and we'll have you preloaded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say we start with the Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Winner, first place of the Dabadoo solvent
list in Barcelona, Spain this past,
[SPEAKER_05]: just a couple of weeks ago actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: House of the Great Gardener was the man,
and so this is his.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say we load everyone up a nice,
well here, yeah, you were going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my birthday, I'm not loading bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here, I'll let you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a little bit on there already,
but you might as well give him some Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: John likes to be a little overzealous when
he's preloading.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was telling you not to get an extra hit
there, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm going to put a little
extra in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: When he said he was going to get a little
Barb, I was like, get some out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh you, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you forget about packing my bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fatty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full of melty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and you guys will have to do one at
a time though, because of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess we're starting the gosset
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're starting with Shannon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom through the uber tuba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle's not on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kyle's not on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn down to the top one,
that one's on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the wonderful thing about the D now
is it doesn't take very long to turn on.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it does not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, give Shannon another one,
that was a small one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see a real smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an epic gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, on to Kai with the Cory Cotton
goddess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, don't go too far in front of the
cammy cam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's up to, well, he's climbing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's at 200, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait a second, we'll get up to
proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to switch to Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, John, why don't you hit yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some B line ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat my guy up right now,
waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whether I go after you or after Kai is
fine for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful, and with this,
nice little perk, slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give her a go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give her a go, she's mountain fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of in a hole with your flame
there, if you want me to get that hash for
[SPEAKER_05]: you, it's right over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to suck her.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a perfect hole in the screen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the flame is going right into the
hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so mine's hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Kai?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's almost there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's 500, so I'm going to take this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's really cool looking at this pipe
this close up as the smoke is coming down
[SPEAKER_06]: the center.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the back where the recycler is.
[SPEAKER_06]: How that's all happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome little piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, is that a tasty rip?
[SPEAKER_05]: That barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kai just took his.
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but certainly not least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flavinator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flaving wherever he goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very often that you get to sit
around with a group of friends and puff
[SPEAKER_05]: pipes like this and I just got to say
thanks man for coming over and allowing us
[SPEAKER_05]: the honor really.
Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an honor to hit glass pipes like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just each did our one gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to do the little kind of
move all the pipes over by one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to finish this bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looted myself a fatty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well, I hope you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: This pipe here is probably one of the best
hitting pipes out of the five or six that
[SPEAKER_05]: are on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Particularly for hash and particularly
whether I've done it I think one time with
[SPEAKER_05]: a Dino but even particularly with that
beeline rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a smoke bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to hit it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is one of my favorite pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so this one's going to go over to
Shannon.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to move on to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's going to go over to you sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take this and we'll gently move these
guys over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how she moved that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't even pick it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slid it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually better to pick it up a
little bit and not slide it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At home I have like cloth mats and things
that I have under the glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have brought some out actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so what do we think?
[SPEAKER_05]: An Afghani number one next up or Heyoma?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Afghani's that cream stuff right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh that's to go with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a rip of Afghani for everyone on
the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also from the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm doing here is I'm putting
squishing some Haas together for some nice
[SPEAKER_06]: dabs for rail three or four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we'll do all the same hash for each
of our hits.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a gauntlet and then we'll just
continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a fun five piece gauntlet
with monster rips in each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me grab them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we could patty it out and Kai could
put it on and we could dab it right
[SPEAKER_03]: through.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one won't work for this Afghani
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too powdery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can dab them out if you want to start
this one Shannon with a lighter and some
[SPEAKER_05]: beeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get you started with yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So round two on the Epic Flav collection
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3 Koreas, a mothership and a Joe
Peters banjo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very sweet and then oh yeah let's not let
us not forget we've got John's Paki OG
[SPEAKER_05]: cross which is his number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got his Haas which is his Hayes OG
crossed with skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Barb, Heyoma, Afghani all from
the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav's got some beautiful Seedman Hayes
here that he made as well as a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: cushions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep some MKs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent and so I also have a whack in
the other room.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was enough to bring out for here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you ripped yours?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright well then it's time for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we always say though it's not enough
to have heady glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have heady hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean heady glass without heady hash is
just kind of in my opinion a darn shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah it's wasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have pressed up five nice little
dabs here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh you're the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's nice about this D-nail
look?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the ember turned on Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah bottom and then the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership it's really nice looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it die?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the beeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mothership's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm looking forward to getting that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm next up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I love hitting this piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure.
Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just barely even feels a perk.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I mean they're like on the table with
no respect to Corey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corey is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a fabulous artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a tremendous lamp worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean we have Joe Peters,
Banjo, Scott Deppie, Marcel, Carlson
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting on the table here and they're all
gods.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world of glass blowing is certainly
respectable and commendable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well yeah it's like you know I'm sitting
you know it's an honor to be sitting at
[SPEAKER_06]: this table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm full with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That raised my temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like three hits in one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just realized, should I still have
to hit like three or four more?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a huge rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I packed for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greedy, greedy, greedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's going right to you right John?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cord is no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to lift it you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it really is totally no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was worried about the hoss hits here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well make sure the hoss hits stay safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can use your dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then okay what are we gonna hit next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoss?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those hoss dabs?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you can pass one over to Shannon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass one over to Kai.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got one and I've got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hoss dab's going for a dive and Flab's
got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make mine even fatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a fatty one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are good size rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very good size rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys both need lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Birthday rips with my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine flattened anyways though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have flattened yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably up to some nice pancakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You flatten them out fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did a fine job lad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get down on yourself for your
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're flattening dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look just great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like Aureo was voicing there
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is this our third rip?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I get to finish it with
the Carlson actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking a rip out of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a neat hitting pipe Shannon?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see the bowl so it's fairly
awkward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what you can see is the little
chubbling bladder that is the body of the
[SPEAKER_06]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely put a ripper in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Padded it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow I'll tell you that last rip got me
spun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow that's like your third pick right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see Shannon is burning very
nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: She can puff bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to take it all at once.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get on yours there soon Kai.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yours is going to go burn just as long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couples rips here on the Bowman's
birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually one of these pieces would make it
to someone's house if it was lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone would pop on that piece and
it would just be like oh my god oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: See I'm not playing around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is so cool to have a hitting piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hit that Cory Cotnum and I just hit
the Joe Peters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm hitting another ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well it looks like it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is your turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a mothership like the crazy crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a champion.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows how to drive a dapper that boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been around the block.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't his first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do like single dabbing where each
one starts and at the very last
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's dabbing for a half second at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is quite a cough you have John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very coughy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardest thing to do when you're
coughing is to not cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe when we do the next run we'll all
have a nice breath and we'll all see how
[SPEAKER_05]: long we can not cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun because even right now I'm
suppressing coughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to him cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not make it any easier for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay let's understand the cough's gone
roughly about a 35 day flush so the cough
[SPEAKER_06]: is in the cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I broke some sweat on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one gave me some sweat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one gave me sweat but the last one
broke my sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's contagious like life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slide your head over that way and I'll
gently slide this one over your way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cords should be fine as far as they're
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was quite a bit of slack on those
cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay but they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well we could do the hayoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would we just do the hayoma?
[SPEAKER_05]: No we did the barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the afghanis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a sativa boost at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to pick me up?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can finish it off with the
number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can finish it off with the number four
no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody good with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the packy OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did that dry sifting just the other day
and we were promoting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were pairing on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 39 or 41.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to explain.
[SPEAKER_05]: 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the sift we made which was 12 grams
we got 40% of that was heads when I
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not 40% return.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not 40% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not 40% heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 40% of our initial sift was heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 60% just ended up being I guess
smaller heads and some contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of it was almost 40%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we had 37, 39, and 41.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there one as low as 37?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was like... That was the two
cushions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just probably because it was just
less buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was your handiwork Flav?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got that real hazy Seedman haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you and I could just do dunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little dunk there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a dab from the slab for that matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A dab from the slab with Flav.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slab dabbing is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's turning into a slab.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the number four.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we should... You should...
Alright so Shannon is on her number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just ripped three heady rips of full
melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry sift and... Was any of it bubbling?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this bubble?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our first bubble we're hitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've hit three dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now our number four is a bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sativa so it should give us a
little bit of a race.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of a sore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And line us up real nicely for that final
and most beautiful fifth rip that will be
[SPEAKER_05]: the number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: These patties that Jon is... Four will be
five.

[SPEAKER_05]: It will be like a foot long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look it's your hit almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ty and Shannon are like... They've already
stepped up to bat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it's good to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's pushing me.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't get that push it's good to be
pushed.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're finishing it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was that Ky?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm allowed to get into this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really interesting piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the corey like...
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say you guys are
really focused on the glass right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hash is just like doing this with the
hash all the time with this glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite something how each one hits so
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite pieces that I
own out of all the glass that I own.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for bringing your favorite piece
for his birthday party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last time I hit that one was
maybe when we did the Marcel tribute.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we hit the angler.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually sitting on my nightstand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Singularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really good ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had that one at your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it sits in the am gas chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: No the big column.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big column.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pulls out of the chamber.
[SPEAKER_06]: No it was this big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about the one in the...
[SPEAKER_03]: No no no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it post murphy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My associate named it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just a giant tube with an
octopus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Marcel tube with an octopus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the pipe formerly known as post
murphy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want a carb cap?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a fucking Winnipeg man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need no carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay so I believe this one is going over
to Shannon so we're gonna go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh you haven't hit it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow I'm way ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I rip a bowl and I expect you to be nice
nice execution there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm great on the recovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: John can recover dunks if you recall from
our Barcelona experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that he never realized that I
missed the dunk when he said I was gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No I didn't say you were gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make sure you pay attention and don't
miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That worked really well as a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're getting on to starting to
ask the next ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move these ones back right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm moving on to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one can go right back to Shannon.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one stays with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here why don't you move that just to John.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright so a little bit of rearranging
here at the gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are on our last and final piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta learn how to talk in between the
coughing here at the Gauntlet birthday
[SPEAKER_05]: bash.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no shortage of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When one stops another begins.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something to say John?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta hold it up to the light a little
bit.
