[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going guys welcome to bubble
man's world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just had a kind of a thought in regards to
a reply I was about to do on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought I would share it with you
guys directly It's kind of about the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between what drying Wet hashes
as opposed to curing hash so With the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying of wet hash what we're doing is we
want to wick the moisture out That's
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped on the outside of the glands that
the hash has sort of trapped into itself
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we pull fresh bubble out of
one of our bags And this is why we go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of breaking it into
powder whether you're straining it or
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving it Getting it spread thinly it's
why I always say use a desiccant because
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to pull this moisture out of The
hash it needs to be removed from the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: the smallest amount of it can over time
degrade The wax membrane and affect your
[SPEAKER_00]: hash to the point where we've always
called it a sort of a whitey effect Where
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of white ease out, but I a lot of
people are using the term butter It's
[SPEAKER_00]: buttering out so to avoid such a thing
what we want to do is we want to dry the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash Properly with the use of a desiccant
this can take five to seven days easily
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get your hash dry Then we can get
to the point of curing it and what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: by curing it is we want to allow the wax
membrane To de-moisturize to almost
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydrate okay that thin little membrane
if you look at my photos when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: living They're very bulbous and thick and
when they dry out after you know a good
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time They shrivel up almost like
a raisin So I'm going to be showing photos
[SPEAKER_00]: of this on my Facebook page and Instagram
and talking about it a little bit more But
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you guys to know the
importance now This would be I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: sixth tip that I've given the fifth or
sixth tip On the bubble hash installments
[SPEAKER_00]: of water hash tips with bubble man,
and I think it's a very important one as a
[SPEAKER_00]: water extractor The water and the ice are
doing almost everything for you in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to isolating the gland the grower has done
everything for you to create quality resin
[SPEAKER_00]: so your really only job is to get that
hash dry and then to cure it out if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can Make a batch of hash and have it
selling on the shelves a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's great to access for
Medicine, but as a hash connoisseur what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to notice over time is that
when you allow that wax membrane to
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydrate and to lose that last little bit
of moisture as well as all the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: that was present from the water process
You get a final product that is so smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: and such an enjoyable thing to smoke you
almost You look back at water hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: has moisture in it and you feel that it's
been somewhat ruined It almost is the akin
[SPEAKER_00]: of going back in the day when someone grew
beautiful earth But didn't cure it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly didn't dry it properly these are
very important processes for both herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: hash And that's why I wanted to show this
share this tip with you today,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I hope it was a useful tip I'm going to
leave you with a bong rip because I'd hate
[SPEAKER_00]: to I'd hate to talk to you and not have a
beautiful bong rip while I do so so while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mulling over what I just said about
the you know the actual What drying is as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to what curing is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit a de-nail there
[SPEAKER_00]: props Thanks for watching see you next
time
