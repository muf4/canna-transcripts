[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: In Kingston, Jamaica, with my brethren,
Prophecy!
[SPEAKER_05]: Give thanks, Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're super happy to be here, as always.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be heading up to the
mountains, to Stonehill Studio,
[SPEAKER_05]: Kittis, and I believe Ken Booth might be
up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't be happier myself right now to
be here with Prophecy, rolling through
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingston and heading up to see Kittis Eye
and these other just incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: inspirational musicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought the drone, so hopefully we get
some really cool drone footage if they
[SPEAKER_05]: allow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just keep showing you guys a little
bit of the cruise, and you're with
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubbleman and Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving through Kingston with Prophecy,
listening to Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pay attention, listen to the words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I feel blessed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why I rose to this
spirituality.
[SPEAKER_04]: To become so subversive, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yours, Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the wordsmith.
[SPEAKER_05]: Halfway tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make it happen.
Let's make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're just pulling up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a question for you, Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, you know, as a Jamaican artist,
you know, a roots artist, what do these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys that we're about to go see mean to
you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys like Ken Booth and Kittis Eye?
[SPEAKER_05]: These elders?
[SPEAKER_04]: They make you welcome and they're
inclusive, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome in their inclusive era.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You understand me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a wider sense of
realization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is you and what is what, and how we're
here to really help with this journey that
[SPEAKER_04]: they have started.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, just Rastafari again,
because this bridge is the real deal,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited to check out this studio
and to see Kittis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been almost a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with as long as I've seen you last,
so I'm very much looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we are up, up, up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always easy to remember where you
are in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have the same sort of ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, dead end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty nice properties up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice that you guys can make music on
a beautiful property, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here in Kingston with Kittis,
finally linked up with Kittis Eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a year, Kittis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been one year.
[SPEAKER_06]: The full one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, higher than the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Double rainbow over the mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I should fly the drone into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, double rainbow over the mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good eye, Kittis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have them here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Rainbow Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sometimes have five different rainbows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two going that way from down, so going so.
[SPEAKER_06]: One coming across, and then one coming so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day, I happened to see one that
was on the trees and on the land.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just you can't see.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to get up to see how low it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm up here, and this thing is down
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying, blood cloud, if I could have
fly, I would have fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you want to get a bucket,
just stick me closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stick me closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, you're a baby now, blood cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you want to get a bucket,
when you want to get a bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear me, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying to myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the meditation really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the car there, come and have me ride.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have me ride, and when I have me ride
again, I see nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fly down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go in and strip myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a rainbow bath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a rainbow bath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just see the possibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: The end of the rainbow was always this
mystic thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way I see it, in a rainbow arc,
on the trees, over the land, down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like about a 50 foot spread.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do a 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Straight on the sand right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the time I reach, and I start
crying down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a sip, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a sip, because I had a
real spiritual trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember coming into town and I reached.
[SPEAKER_06]: All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am here at the house up in the hills
that Kittis invited me to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to pull out the camera right
away until I got to know everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't sure if they were working on
an unreleased studio album.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got a couple of guys here from France
that are just doing some incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the yard is in the house,
a big part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kittis and all these great people
being a part of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels really great to be here with
Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just flew a little drone footage,
which I'm going to show you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my life, it's my life, it's my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's your life, it's your life,
it's your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we come together for one life,
we're coming from behind, behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission,
showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind,
trotting forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's
[SPEAKER_06]: turn, let's turn the tables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I and I come to turn the tables.
Turn the paradigm around.
Yes, deprogram and reprogram.
Free mankind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission,
showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind,
trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the mindset of the people,
child children.
[SPEAKER_06]: True to children seeking for the via,
the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I and I come to freedom, freedom,
with a light in the candle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission,
showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind,
trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission,
showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind,
trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, just a little bit of pulling back
that really epic scene of showing our
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't have much of a battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the drone was giving me a few errors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I think I'll do right now is have
a quick tab with all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make sure I can do this here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that light behind my head and you
actually might be able to see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just had a really beautiful vegetarian
stew, soup I guess, if you will,
[SPEAKER_05]: which really hit the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best food I've had since I've been here.
[SPEAKER_05]: My stomach feels so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a bit of a tummy ache since I got here
not eating the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give thanks to Jamaica, give thanks to
all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the kindness and hospitality that I
always receive when I'm here with the band
[SPEAKER_05]: in the background, we're gonna go see them
right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: For now, let's dab it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go check these guys out.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Prophecy?
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready for another dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have small ears, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: First we'll play your small ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three and.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three and.
[SPEAKER_03]: One,
[SPEAKER_03]: two, three and.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three and.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, two,
[SPEAKER_05]: three and.
[SPEAKER_06]: One,
[SPEAKER_05]: two, three and.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's delicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's sweet.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
