[SPEAKER_20]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's get this show on the road.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got to do a little copy and some
quick over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to let some folks in like
Etienne, who's been waiting in the room
[SPEAKER_20]: for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_20]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_22]: Good day, friend.
[SPEAKER_22]: Good day, sir.
[SPEAKER_20]: And a happy, wonderful new year to you
too, sir.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, and to you as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure why my AirPods aren't
working, but I'm going to go in and try
[SPEAKER_20]: and fix that right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's nice to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been far too long.
[SPEAKER_22]: When was our last hash church,
by the way?
[SPEAKER_22]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'm not even sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably the last, well, maybe not the
last one.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you had, you weren't able to make
it or something.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think I did miss that last one.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_20]: Desperately to get my headphones to work.
[SPEAKER_20]: They are not working.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's hope that I don't have too much of a
problem today with a feedback and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_22]: None here, but you know, no issues so far
so smoothly.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I got to do it inside here
actually real quick.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'll go on and we can fix this.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_20]: Audio.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaker Marcus's air pod pro say something
at 10.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in my ears.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, your candy.
[SPEAKER_20]: And let's let Mark in.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark is the breeder who created that hash
church cultivar.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to let him in.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to let Wade in everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hashiest of new years.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if these guys come in without a
problem with their audio or their
[SPEAKER_18]: technical.
[SPEAKER_18]: I see Mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: I see Wade.
[SPEAKER_20]: I see them both as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is your phone, is your audio working
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mark's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year's fellas.
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy New Year's to you brother.
[SPEAKER_20]: And welcome to hash church.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to introduce you real quick.
[SPEAKER_20]: So Mark is a guy that hit me up.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, I got this cultivar and I
want to, I want to name it hash church.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was kind of like, I want to name it
hash church.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's, let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't just be naming anything hash
church.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like a long running show.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I started talking to Mark and very
humble guy, very kind guy, quite obviously
[SPEAKER_20]: a very Canadian guy actually.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's, yeah, he starts hitting me up.
[SPEAKER_20]: He sends me, he sends me a little flower
first.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's like, I want you to see this flower.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can say that because it's totally legal
in Canada to send someone some cannabis
[SPEAKER_20]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_20]: That shit wasn't happening in 2019,
but here in 2021, Mark could send me some
[SPEAKER_20]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_20]: So he sends me this.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: He sends me this flower.
[SPEAKER_20]: So look at this flower.
[SPEAKER_20]: A little frosty, a little nut nut.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just covered bro.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like covered to the point of like,
even right away when I posted it,
[SPEAKER_20]: people like, Oh, is that hooked trichomes?
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they real trichomes?
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause it just looks so, so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like it's so furry and frosty.
[SPEAKER_20]: So Mark was like, look, he sent me a cut.
[SPEAKER_20]: I completely shit the bed on the cut was
not, was unable to take care of it,
[SPEAKER_20]: but I was able to share it with a friend.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we still have it growing and we're
still going to see it bloom.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark didn't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_20]: He was like, I'll send you some flour,
run some bubble, which I did.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got the bubble and pizza boxes over
there.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very lovely, melty bubble,
blonde, tasty, flavorful bubble reminds me
[SPEAKER_20]: of some old school Dutch treats that I
used to grow back in the day.
[SPEAKER_20]: That was also very, very coded in
residence.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're, we've invited Mark and we're
going to end up talking about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: This hash church cultivar throughout the
day here.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanted to make them a part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just sort of kind of, you know,
share my thanks with him and also kind of
[SPEAKER_20]: apologize because I've been so busy and
here we are during a global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, things are going rough with,
for Mark and his family.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like it's not just smooth, it's not just a
big sale and they're, they're really
[SPEAKER_20]: trying to hold it together and rock and
roll and make things work out.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now they're sitting on this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the minute I posted it, I'm certain
the guy could have probably sold 50,000
[SPEAKER_20]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: People just hitting them up left,
right, and center.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's like, look, I'm not going to sell
any of this.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make sure you're good with
it, that it's the hash church cultivar,
[SPEAKER_20]: that it's real.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not trying to build fake hype and all
this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's kind of the story behind Mark
just seemed like a good dude with a nice
[SPEAKER_20]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thought, yeah, it's a beautiful
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_20]: I should, you know, me allowing him to
name it hash church is nothing more than
[SPEAKER_20]: me saying, sure, you can name it hash
church.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not partnering up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going into the seed business to
make money off cultivars.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's none of what I'm interested in,
but I love the idea of helping good folks.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the bubble did come out very,
very nicely.
[SPEAKER_20]: I also pressed a little bit of Ross and it
had a really nice kind of unique,
[SPEAKER_20]: almost an old school high, if that makes
any sense.
[SPEAKER_20]: And welcome to hash church, Mark.
[SPEAKER_20]: How's that for a buildup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was, it's been a long little
journey with this little plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mysterious things have come up with
it throughout its little journey too,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, yeah, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, absolutely welcome.
[SPEAKER_20]: And welcome to you, Mr. House of Harlequin
Wade.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been a while since I saw your smiley,
beautiful face as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we want to welcome you to the room and
welcome your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you and Tian and always
fun to hear about new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a good year already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really looking forward to hearing how
everyone else is doing and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some news at some point to share.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love the sounds of kind of everyone
doing that, sharing some news,
[SPEAKER_20]: talking about the old year, talking about
the new year.
[SPEAKER_20]: I did come to the conclusion the other day
that 2021 can be spelt out 2021 W O N,
[SPEAKER_20]: but we won't have that because 2021 is a
new year and we're going to, we're going
[SPEAKER_20]: to bust it out.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've got, and then there's 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_20]: snap.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're in 2020 for a couple more years.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a sequel going on 2021,
22, 23, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I feel like things are going to get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hello at John.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, Wade.
[SPEAKER_22]: Much love and respect.
[SPEAKER_22]: Good to see you're well and doing what you
do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a good time.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we'll shout out to Chimera.
[SPEAKER_20]: He just sent me an email saying he's not
going to be able to make it today as he
[SPEAKER_20]: has no heat.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's trying to sort that out.
[SPEAKER_20]: So welcome to Canada.
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome to, I'm not even sure where
Chimera is these days, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_20]: but he's usually kind of in a wooded area.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yesterday was wicked, wicked windy.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm surprised I have power right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of a blessing that we're able to
do this first of the hash church.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Bingo Lombardi.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to get into it in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just going to let Alison in.
[SPEAKER_20]: I invited a ton of awesome people into
hash church today, friends and,
[SPEAKER_20]: and fam that I haven't seen in a long time
that we haven't been able to kind of
[SPEAKER_20]: connect.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of you I connect with the odd time on
zoom chats, like Mr. Colin Palmer.
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome Colin.
[SPEAKER_20]: I see him every once in a while,
but I don't get to see all of you.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will apologize to the entire hash
church community, because I do feel like
[SPEAKER_20]: I've dropped the ball a little bit.
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess we got to the point where hash
church felt secure enough of a show that
[SPEAKER_20]: even if I didn't do it for months and
months, all I had to do is text you guys,
[SPEAKER_20]: we get back together and we have a show
and that's kind of how it started to play
[SPEAKER_20]: out.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I have a lot of people, we have to
understand that there's a group of people,
[SPEAKER_20]: hundreds of them that look forward to
gathering on Sundays while we Yammer on
[SPEAKER_20]: about whatever it is we Yammer on.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're in the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: There is about three, 260 people in the
chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: And these are the guys and gals that look
forward to whatever it is we're
[SPEAKER_20]: discussing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I saw one of them today say,
man, I wish we, I wish we could do more
[SPEAKER_20]: hash churches.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I miss, I miss gathering with
all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I sometimes forget that we're the key
holders in that gathering.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, if we make the point on showing
up, everyone gets to gather, everyone gets
[SPEAKER_20]: to enjoy themselves.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do thank all of you.
[SPEAKER_20]: All of you for taking some time out on a
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Johnny B's in the house too.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I saw him sneak in.
[SPEAKER_20]: We got Johnny B in the house over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_20]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's got his whole headset on.
[SPEAKER_20]: Looks like he's about to take off on a
plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying with the headset,
but it did not work for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll plug in the Yeti microphone.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phone check right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's much better, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right there is, that's, that's,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made sure I came in clear for 2021
because I'm clear headed and we're ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to start growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited for this year of being the
grow year of 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is just going to start popping
seeds, popping those genetics and let's
[SPEAKER_03]: get the grow on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_20]: Grow your plants like Johnny B is growing
his hair.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what's up right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to cut the hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my hair cut last year in January
when I went for the Lyft conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, then all of this
pandemic stuff came up and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to cut my hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start going to the mosh pits.
[SPEAKER_20]: With all your broken bones and broken
spine, you're going to go to the mosh
[SPEAKER_20]: pits.
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't even be surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do the motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to move the whole body now.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would not even be surprised if I was in
a Slayer mosh pit and I looked over and
[SPEAKER_20]: saw you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you'd see me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slipping on all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, you know, I've been kind of
striving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find a screen for my hash pipe
all morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I pulled out some nice Congo dabs just
to kind of bring in the 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should be doing a nice big
dab.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I like it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's show everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's show the cameras what we got,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to go to gallery view so
everyone can see what we're holding up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got a little strawberry banana from
Concentrated X looking oh so greasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some 9110.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this here, guys, is the LA Kush cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is some fire bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some of the best that I've managed
to get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really happy with this.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Wade held up some nice big chunks of
hash.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Colin had some jars of goodness there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, got some lemon cake, some square
wave, dab of stash from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really enjoyed his work.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've still got my amalgam that goes
back to 2012.
[SPEAKER_22]: My everlasting Gobstopper that I keep
adding to.
[SPEAKER_22]: So still going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I should bring a plant in today,
you know, show it off in house church.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Mehdi Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the nose on Mehdi?
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: How's the two of you?
[SPEAKER_06]: The terpy profile on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the?
[SPEAKER_06]: The terpy profile?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's one of those
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an original Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to call it like a pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Carmeo would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a pre-93 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really liked it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those specials.
[SPEAKER_03]: How old is she?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_03]: How old is she?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been running the same strain since
2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is definitely one of the coolest.
[SPEAKER_22]: How many weeks is she in flower currently?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is day 56.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by scoping it last night, I got amber
tricones all milky, no clear at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty much it's at that stage
that it's going to get washed probably
[SPEAKER_03]: today or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, I want to welcome Alison into the
room.
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome, Alison.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: How the heck have you been?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have metamorphosed from doing the
edibles to actually accepting my
[SPEAKER_10]: doctorate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had a doctorate the whole time
I was in cannabis and I just never used
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dr. Sunil Agrawal approached me when
there was a flux, a change between medical
[SPEAKER_10]: and recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he started a cannabis and psychedelic
integrative medicine practice up here in
[SPEAKER_10]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm practicing psychotherapy with cannabis
and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably some of the best work I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it doesn't even surprise me in the
least because the mushroom has been boring
[SPEAKER_20]: its little way back into my life.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like so crazy.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't even like tell you all how
hardcore the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now just to give everyone a little
idea, you know, I've had a relationship
[SPEAKER_20]: with the mushroom for a very long time
since the late eighties, early nineties,
[SPEAKER_20]: when my roommate Jason ordered spores from
syzygy company that was owned by Kat and
[SPEAKER_20]: Terrence McKenna.
[SPEAKER_20]: We ordered the syzygy strand.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the main, which is the parental stock
of the penis envy mushroom nowadays.
[SPEAKER_20]: Syzygy is of course the mushroom that
Dennis McKenna and Terrence McKenna
[SPEAKER_20]: collected in the Amazon during the
seventies prior to writing their book,
[SPEAKER_20]: The Mushroom Growers Guide, which was one
of the first times people were able to
[SPEAKER_20]: gather information on cultivating
mushrooms indoors.
[SPEAKER_20]: They took it a step further.
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess there was a priest down in the
Amazon who had cleared some trees to raise
[SPEAKER_20]: some cattle.
[SPEAKER_20]: The cattle started shitting.
[SPEAKER_20]: The shit started spawning.
[SPEAKER_20]: The mushrooms started speaking.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the McKenna started listening.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that sort of brought the mushroom to
Hawaii, which we shipped it in a spore
[SPEAKER_20]: print over to Winnipeg, Manitoba,
an absolute incubator of alcoholism where
[SPEAKER_20]: we thought, let's see if we can get less
people to drink alcohol and trip out on
[SPEAKER_20]: these wonderful mushrooms that were
growing in my closet at the time in grain
[SPEAKER_20]: prior to the PF tech.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we didn't have the old distilled spores
in water that we could just inject.
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually were forced to use transfer
chambers where you had to take the old
[SPEAKER_20]: gloves and build them into a box and do
everything inside that, which was a little
[SPEAKER_20]: bit a step above growing cannabis,
which we thought was pretty amazing at the
[SPEAKER_20]: time, but all of a sudden inoculating
mycelium into agar, transferring agar into
[SPEAKER_20]: grain, casing grain and growing and
fruiting mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_20]: This was a whole other incredible
experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I cannot tell you how blessed I am to
have had that experience, to have had the
[SPEAKER_20]: mushroom in my life.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll never forget stumping Paul Stamets at
the psychedelic gathering in Whistler one
[SPEAKER_20]: year where I got to meet the entire
psychedelic family from Ralph Metzner to
[SPEAKER_20]: Jonathan Ott, to Paul Stamets,
to Finn McKenna was there at the time.
[SPEAKER_20]: His father Terrence had just passed away,
but it was really quite an incredible
[SPEAKER_20]: time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Paul Stamets walked by my booth that I
had, and I was selling bubble bags and I
[SPEAKER_20]: had a macro photograph from Joep Dumas in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said to Paul, I said, can you
identify this mushroom?
[SPEAKER_20]: And he stood there for three or four
minutes with this totally stumped look on
[SPEAKER_20]: his face.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I finally said, you know, listen,
it's actually a glandular trichome,
[SPEAKER_20]: just busting your balls.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_20]: I do look forward to seeing him again one
day and bringing that up because I
[SPEAKER_20]: guarantee you, he won't forget being
stumped on a mushroom identification photo
[SPEAKER_20]: that indeed was not a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: So awesome to hear that you're doing all
of that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Allison Drayson.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually Dennis McKenna and Paul
Stamets are currently working with our
[SPEAKER_10]: clinic because we've had a hard time with
decrim in Washington state of
[SPEAKER_10]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not as fantastic as Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're trying to come at it from
another perspective with the right to try
[SPEAKER_10]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're currently we have submitted
documentation to the DEA to do psilocybin
[SPEAKER_10]: for end of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so a couple of my patients are part of
the study to be able to use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terminal cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are we work with McKenna and Stamets
as well, because Stamets is helping us
[SPEAKER_10]: procure the psilocybin for our project.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm going to put up a cyanescent
mushroom cap that I photographed with my
[SPEAKER_20]: macro camera.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never photographed psilocybin
mushrooms with my macro photograph.
[SPEAKER_20]: But as we're talking about the mushroom,
I should I feel and this is another sort
[SPEAKER_20]: of trippy thing that the mushroom pulled
me forward.
[SPEAKER_20]: I discovered cyanescence mushrooms growing
on a grow that I had back 20 plus years
[SPEAKER_20]: ago.
[SPEAKER_20]: We seen some dreadlocked kid picking
mushrooms like it was going out of style
[SPEAKER_20]: in our front yard.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're just trying to grow cannabis
illegally at the time, not let anyone
[SPEAKER_20]: know.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we see this kid and I buy Paul's book
and I start to discover that this is one
[SPEAKER_20]: of the single largest patches of
cyanescence that I have ever seen in my
[SPEAKER_20]: life.
[SPEAKER_20]: This kid must have gotten eight to ten
pounds before we finally caught him and
[SPEAKER_20]: said, please stop picking the mushrooms on
our property and heating us out.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have an illegal grow over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't say that, but we were definitely
feeling it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so recently, 20 plus years later,
22 years later, I was pulled in by the
[SPEAKER_20]: mushroom again this year.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if any of you saw some of the
mushroom photos I've been posting,
[SPEAKER_20]: but we found some massive cyanescent
flushes here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, like I'm talking me and my friend
were rolling around on the ground giggling
[SPEAKER_20]: like schoolgirls.
[SPEAKER_20]: We were so giddy.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just the most exciting,
amazing thing to see the mushroom come
[SPEAKER_20]: back full circle into my life.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been doing micro doses to the macro
doses I did for so many years.
[SPEAKER_20]: When we first started growing Terence's
mushrooms, we were pretty much of the
[SPEAKER_20]: belief system that if we didn't eat five
grams in a dark room, that there was no
[SPEAKER_20]: purpose or point in eating these
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see Wade tilting his head back and
laughing like, oh, young people,
[SPEAKER_20]: like, oh my God, because we were like
teenagers in our just young twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really laughing at having done that
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was the most amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, you know, so many people that have
asked me over the years, do you go to
[SPEAKER_20]: university?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, where did you go to university?
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really take a quote once again out
of Paul Stamets book when I saw him speak
[SPEAKER_20]: in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe it was 1995, the first year
that I actually met Dave Skunkman Sam,
[SPEAKER_20]: he was at this event as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was kind of like a hemp and psychedelic
event.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Jonathan Ott was thanking the people
at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, everyone was thanking Yale
University and all of these, like,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, super brilliant men that went to
these incredible institutions.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then and then Paul Stamets gets up and
he's kind of got a disheveled shirt on.
[SPEAKER_20]: He says, oh, wow, you know, I,
I learned everything I learned from the
[SPEAKER_20]: mushroom and standing ovation like right
away already is like just take all the
[SPEAKER_20]: universities and push them off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's like, I just want to give props
where props are due.
[SPEAKER_20]: Not that Harvard and Yale and all those
amazing people aren't great, but the
[SPEAKER_20]: mushroom taught me everything.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would I would really say the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really wonderful to see,
of course, cannabis is an accelerator.
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, cannabis, once it breaks
through and gets to, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: breaks through into legalization,
into breaking out of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_20]: psychedelic plants are going to be a close
follow up.
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes sense as you open your mind to
stopping believing in the propaganda that
[SPEAKER_20]: has been so strong over the last several
hundred plus years.
[SPEAKER_20]: And for people that want to get into this,
there's an incredible book out there
[SPEAKER_20]: called The Immortal Key.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it really shows the history of when
psychedelics took a left turn and
[SPEAKER_20]: Christianity took a right turn.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you ended up with this really divisive
split between the Greek way of thinking,
[SPEAKER_20]: that scientific sort of proof versus the
paleo Christian way of thinking,
[SPEAKER_20]: which is really that faithful way they
took the the rapture out of the
[SPEAKER_20]: experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: They removed all of the psychedelic
sacraments.
[SPEAKER_20]: They replaced it with the blood of Christ,
of course, which we all know how well that
[SPEAKER_20]: did for indigenous people around the
world.
[SPEAKER_20]: And here we are today.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's kind of my rant.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to welcome the Turners because they
just showed up and somehow Colton became a
[SPEAKER_20]: man since last time he was here.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what's going on, but Colton's
a man now.
[SPEAKER_20]: And here we are in twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's everybody?
[SPEAKER_22]: You got something on your lip right up
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at his chin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going on.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like our little boy is growing up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to actually be twenty one this
year.
[SPEAKER_20]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: That threw me for a loop.
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations, Team Turner.
[SPEAKER_22]: Get the twenty one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I first got diagnosed, they didn't
think I'd live to be 15.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here I am going on twenty one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
So.
[SPEAKER_16]: I like to show you that campus works.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that illegally alive thing really
worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, he still has to be
illegally alive like many others in the
[SPEAKER_08]: United States, which kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm so glad to see your little spore
behind you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really excited about
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hoping that we'll be able to try
mushrooms for his headaches one of these
[SPEAKER_08]: days.
[SPEAKER_20]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_20]: Once you open her up, she's super hard to
close back up.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what the story says anyway.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_20]: The psychedelic mushrooms are really just
the tip of the iceberg because with what
[SPEAKER_20]: Paul's got going on and a lot of people in
the community right now that have going on
[SPEAKER_20]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine, who I hope to
see here later on, I've been taking their
[SPEAKER_20]: capsules.
[SPEAKER_20]: I take Paul's capsules, Lion's mane,
but I also take the chaga and the turkey
[SPEAKER_20]: tail and the cordyceps and a whole variety
of other mushrooms that Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_20]: Medicine put into their capsules.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm I'm always enjoying both of those
capsules.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just can't say enough about all of
these medicinal mushrooms and the new
[SPEAKER_20]: tropics and how they offer this
regeneration to your brain and this
[SPEAKER_20]: elasticity as you grow older for memory.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just I can't say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know the most about it,
so I won't say too, too much.
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's some very interesting
conversations to be had around this
[SPEAKER_20]: fungus, for sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_20]: Getting the macro camera out and starting
to shoot it and see it in a way that I've
[SPEAKER_20]: never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, just like cannabis really opened my
mind to learning more about the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, I just I can't say enough about
about the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited about the future of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just we're kind of going into to
mushrooms like we did cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, completely just like new and
fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that people call it psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we know that there's a little
nickname called silly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and that's all we know about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the some of the things that I've seen
and heard is it's it's the same path that
[SPEAKER_08]: we were taking with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they say that cannabis is a
gateway drug, it really is because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: opened our mind and opened our
opportunities to so many different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and mushrooms hopefully can be one of
these.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hoping to be able to give them to
Colton because he has migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've heard so many good stories about
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our friend Dr. Sue Sisley is doing a lot
of research on on psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she really believes that if Colton
could access that, then then she thinks
[SPEAKER_08]: that it would really break through his
migraine headaches and he wouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_08]: take, you know, sumitriptan and
nortriptyline and gabapentin and things
[SPEAKER_08]: like that, that they're wanting to
prescribe him for for migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, we're really excited for
for that legislation to come through.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're hoping that eventually we'll be
able to get involved in that and and
[SPEAKER_08]: understand a little bit more about
psilocybin and mushrooms and stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, well, I can tell you that the mushroom
the mushroom is actually excited about the
[SPEAKER_20]: turners becoming proponents of the
mushroom because the mushroom has seen
[SPEAKER_20]: what you've done for the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guarantee you, it won't be too
different for the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: When you say you jumped in like newbies,
I was going to say you did like a triple
[SPEAKER_20]: backflip off the high high diving board.
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't that usually how the turners enter a
community?
[SPEAKER_08]: We basically can do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we are gymnasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I look forward to sharing the
journey with you guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love this whole psychedelic renaissance
that we're in the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't help but think that cannabis had
an incredible, you know, impact on the
[SPEAKER_20]: cracking of the core of the social fabric
that allowed this to start taking place
[SPEAKER_20]: and to start rooting.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's been a long, long, long journey.
[SPEAKER_20]: When you think of so many years back,
are Gordon Wasson stepping into Marius and
[SPEAKER_20]: being as little little little hut to take
the psilocybin mushrooms for the first
[SPEAKER_20]: time.
[SPEAKER_20]: That really started it out.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you guys want to learn about psilocybin
mushrooms and how they kind of ended up
[SPEAKER_20]: into the Western society, check out our
Gordon Wasson.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he wrote a really great article.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is anyone going to remember the name of
the article he wrote in Time or Life
[SPEAKER_20]: magazine on the mushroom, the silly,
the simple mushroom or this?
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, there's if you if you Google it,
you'll come up with it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely a good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's where a lot of people kind of
I'm going to pop in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a really great book that Primmer
that I recommend for all of my clients who
[SPEAKER_10]: are interested in exploring psychedelics
to change their mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's Michael Pollan's How to Change
Your Mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a really great basic book.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say, like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything that you're talking about,
Marcus, like psychedelics would be the
[SPEAKER_10]: best tool in my toolbox.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've actually been a psychologist for
almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the easiest pathway to explore your
mind and to to let go of the old ghosts.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you spell Pollan?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you spell his last name?
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a great all of his books are great.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's out of Oregon and you can get it on
Audible as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not at Berkeley anymore.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not teaching there anymore.
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember he was teaching for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: He might be the last I heard from folks in
my office was that he was done in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it could just be he was working with
the Oregon psilocybin crew.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_20]: He jumps in full throttle to whatever he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he jumped into psychedelics and took
some pretty heavy trips as an older
[SPEAKER_20]: gentleman.
[SPEAKER_20]: And to me, my hat's off.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I gave him respect for jumping in and
doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, he's an absolutely
impeccable writer.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what he specializes in writing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you haven't read The Omnivore's
Dilemma or The Botany of Desire,
[SPEAKER_20]: these are all spectacular books that that
he has written.
[SPEAKER_20]: R.
[SPEAKER_20]: Gordon Wasson's article was called Seeking
the Magic Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was published in May of 1957 in Life
magazine.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you guys can check that out as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: And she's right.
[SPEAKER_20]: That is absolutely the place to start is
how to change your mind.
[SPEAKER_20]: I listened to it a couple of months back
on Audible.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I mean, getting through this whole
pandemic craziness, almost every one of my
[SPEAKER_10]: clients is currently microdosing in some
fashion with a macro dose thrown in there
[SPEAKER_10]: for good measure, because it's it's we
have no control over the craziness that's
[SPEAKER_10]: going on in our world.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's it's a perfect time to really
investigate your psyche and come to some
[SPEAKER_10]: form of happiness from within.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you just called it because listen,
life isn't about figuring out how to stop
[SPEAKER_20]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_20]: Life is suffering.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to suffer throughout the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's how you react to your suffering.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the great trick.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what Thich Nhan Ha says in his
wonderful book, The Art of Living.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you haven't listened to that book or
read that book, this is another amazing
[SPEAKER_20]: book that will bring you solace in Western
society.
[SPEAKER_20]: We tend to have foundational beliefs
systems that set us up for anguish and
[SPEAKER_20]: pain.
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, this we become attached.
[SPEAKER_20]: We become attached to our little dog when
our little dog dies.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're shattered.
[SPEAKER_20]: We become attached to our parents when our
parents die.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're shattered.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, these are there's different ways of
having your belief systems switch so that
[SPEAKER_20]: you once you don't believe that death is
final, that belief system.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it opens up a whole other
opportunity to remove some of that
[SPEAKER_20]: suffering or at least some of that
reactionary suffering, how we react to our
[SPEAKER_20]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the big trick in life.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think I said it recently when
someone asked me, what do you think about
[SPEAKER_20]: this mushroom thing?
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it just going to be a big corporate
takeover and blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_20]: blah?
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, you know, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, what I really think about it is is
that it's probably the most important
[SPEAKER_20]: thing in regards to psychology and
psychiatry, being able to remove ourselves
[SPEAKER_20]: from the pharmaceutical drugs that people
are currently taking, messing with brain
[SPEAKER_20]: chemistries when you have access to fungi
and plants that do it, but on a very
[SPEAKER_20]: different level and a very more personal
sort of soul seeking level.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, already with people who are
terminally ill, they're finding a single
[SPEAKER_20]: dose of psilocybin done and taken the
right way with the right person can give
[SPEAKER_20]: them instantaneous relief of death.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because here's the thing, when you realize
that death is actually just a transition,
[SPEAKER_20]: just like you're transitioning your
suffering into happiness, just like you've
[SPEAKER_20]: transitioned your fetus into birth.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no death.
[SPEAKER_20]: And once you have that revelation,
of course, you're going to be less
[SPEAKER_20]: stressed out about death when you have a
complete and total understanding that
[SPEAKER_20]: death is a complete and total illusion.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not really real.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just another transformation.
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are things I think the world
desperately needs right now, maybe a
[SPEAKER_20]: little bit more than another four hours of
CNN.
[SPEAKER_20]: But we are.
[SPEAKER_22]: But Michael's book also spoke to the
reconnecting that psychedelic mushrooms
[SPEAKER_22]: do, and especially in older patients and
people who are suffering trauma,
[SPEAKER_22]: it reconnects nerves and pathways,
neural pathways in the brain that I think
[SPEAKER_22]: is exponential to human healing,
especially during this most troubled time
[SPEAKER_22]: of covid.
[SPEAKER_22]: But especially it's going to be needed for
these health care workers who as a combat
[SPEAKER_22]: that I can see the thousand yard stare in
these poor workers, my sisters and nurse
[SPEAKER_22]: and others that are just dealing with
death.
[SPEAKER_22]: Day in and day out, they're going to need
this therapy as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the older patients and those that
survive the damage that's done,
[SPEAKER_22]: they're going to need it for healing,
especially mentally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's good that you're bringing that
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that's something I was going to going
to chime in on is, you know, to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like being in the pocket when you're
playing music with other other
[SPEAKER_06]: instrumentation happening around you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in the pocket and that opens up
doorways and pathways to go anywhere you
[SPEAKER_06]: want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do things musically that you could
otherwise wouldn't be doing because you're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting yourself and your mind out of the
way and you're allowing yourself to exist
[SPEAKER_06]: and get in touch with yourself and the
pathways that allow you to to be so in
[SPEAKER_06]: tune with the things that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Colin, you just described a part of
this new movie from Pixar called Soul.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know if any of you guys have
seen this movie, but it's heavy,
[SPEAKER_20]: really heavy.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's the guy.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's a piano jazz player.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when he goes into the pocket in his
improvisation, he disappears and he goes
[SPEAKER_20]: to a place where the new souls are born.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they call it the pocket.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's like floating in a purple energy,
just like improvising.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in musical terms, like Trane Astagia
said me plain black to my face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm constantly trying to get out of my own
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I'm that's that's what that's my
dream is to just just get myself out of my
[SPEAKER_06]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just channeling these this energy
and these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all about dexterity and just
being in touch with your your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that's music in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's it's and it's also cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's it's all these things and how
that all works is going to be individual
[SPEAKER_06]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the general ideology of a pocket,
we as musicians, speaking in musical
[SPEAKER_06]: terms, we we always talk about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really, really you're all talking
about this with with these chemicals
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really can't get past yourself if
you're thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're you're never going to get it if
that's for using it as the analogy.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, when you say I need to get out of my
own way, what you're really saying is I
[SPEAKER_20]: really need to get my ego off the couch,
out of the steering wheel, out of the
[SPEAKER_20]: driver's seat and that ego disillusion.
[SPEAKER_20]: People enforce this that they are their
egos.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's where you're also setting
yourself up for some massive, massive pain
[SPEAKER_20]: and anguish because you aren't.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a it's just a mental construct
that you created throughout your life
[SPEAKER_20]: based on your experiences.
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't say that it's nothing because I
truly believe the ego is sort of the
[SPEAKER_20]: controller.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the value of this experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: If we come from the everything,
we come here, we're split, we're divided,
[SPEAKER_20]: we're we're fractured.
[SPEAKER_20]: We get to become the single eye and then
we go back to the source.
[SPEAKER_20]: So this this experience really probably
some of the most valuable experiences that
[SPEAKER_20]: we have on earth is that relationship with
building our ego and designing our ego and
[SPEAKER_20]: using our ego to navigate this three
dimensional reality that we're currently
[SPEAKER_20]: in, because souls or whatever you want to
call that life energy, they don't have
[SPEAKER_20]: that ability.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like this is the valuable universal all
the souls are lining up with their
[SPEAKER_20]: quarters to get a turn at earth.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the game that's got the lineup in
the arcade.
[SPEAKER_20]: And here we all are.
[SPEAKER_20]: And what a joy that we found things like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: We found things like the psychedelic
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God for the people and the
proponents who now are the people here on
[SPEAKER_20]: this very panel.
[SPEAKER_20]: But when we were growing up, we all had
different shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I mean, you know, Wade and and and
Sam were still there back when we were all
[SPEAKER_20]: barely a blink in our daddy's eye.
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, it's a neat thing to have
been able to stand on the shoulders of
[SPEAKER_20]: giants and to pass on this information.
[SPEAKER_20]: And as fast as information is passing,
it's still very, very, very slow.
[SPEAKER_20]: And nothing's quicker than, in my opinion,
eating the flesh of that mushroom,
[SPEAKER_20]: smoking the resin of that cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is where I really start to gather
information and learn and put things
together.
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Each and every one of you for taking this
journey and sharing it with everyone,
[SPEAKER_20]: because we're all learning from it.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Colton was what Colton was 13
when we started our cannabis journey.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now he's going to be 21 this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at seven years of just
cannabis reform, and it's still not even
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we still have in in in the
United States, we still have like 19
[SPEAKER_08]: states that haven't legalized anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now we're starting a whole new
journey with with psilocybin, trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: get it legalized.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, why is it taking so long
when we can get a vaccine for COVID within
[SPEAKER_08]: eight months?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it just doesn't make any sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't understand why we have these
beautiful plans and this this ability to
[SPEAKER_08]: heal ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are making it illegal and people
are keeping it illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: For what reason?
[SPEAKER_20]: I just I can't wrap my my head around to
let us know just how important they are.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the reason.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the reason we do.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's the only reason it's like they
could.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're literally shining a spotlight on
all the most most important things in the
[SPEAKER_20]: universe, basically.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're just over here looking like,
hey, what about what about this over here?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, we should be allowed to have this.
[SPEAKER_20]: And welcome to the Dragonfly Earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's impossible to understand,
but thank goodness we have people in the
[SPEAKER_20]: world like you, Wendy, who just are they
see right through it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got there's bigger things for me than
to swallow a bunch of bullshit that's
[SPEAKER_20]: being fed to me by a news person or a news
anchor.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got this real thing here,
my 13 year old son, who basically just
[SPEAKER_20]: about died in a lake and almost drowned.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now something else isn't right.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't really have time for all this
bullshit over here.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's how you tear through all of
that crap in a very quick manner.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, to me, I was just as blown away when,
you know, people I think it was Chris
[SPEAKER_20]: Christie that like the dad like approached
Chris Christie and was like, my kid will
[SPEAKER_20]: die without this medicine.
[SPEAKER_20]: My kid has epilepsy and will die without
this medicine.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was just like, yeah, no,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't like right to the guy's face.
[SPEAKER_20]: Even I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like it was almost like when Donald Trump
made fun of the guy with the arm,
[SPEAKER_20]: the reporter that was also like a sign
like, oh, of course this is going to take
[SPEAKER_20]: forever because if he could maintain a
presidency after doing that, well,
[SPEAKER_20]: then anything's game.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, of course, like, oh,
what children in America are dying because
[SPEAKER_20]: they don't have access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll get some synthetic stuff your way as
soon as we can.
[SPEAKER_20]: We just got to wrap up these patents,
make sure that the profit margins are
[SPEAKER_14]: approved.
[SPEAKER_20]: Got to be FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's going to take seven years
unless it's a vaccine for COVID hammer
[SPEAKER_16]: that in nine months.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's send millions of dollars to other
countries, but each American can only get
[SPEAKER_16]: $600.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, but we did the same thing when we were
lobbying in DC one year and we went to our
[SPEAKER_08]: representative in Colorado Springs and his
name is Doug Lamborn and that son of a
[SPEAKER_08]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, he looked straight at
our, at my face and said, if it's not FDA
[SPEAKER_08]: approved, then there's nothing I can do
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, can we fast track it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, well, yeah, of course we'll,
we'll sign a bill to fast track it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, we will be the face of that
bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, we will do anything that it takes
to get that bill fast tracked and FDA
[SPEAKER_08]: approved.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, but what are we supposed to do
in the meantime?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, there's nothing I can do
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, well, my kid will die without
this medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he, he can't take the regular
Westernized medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going, he's not going to survive
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he looked at me and he said,
that's not my problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so freaking mad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, yes, it is your problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: It absolutely is your problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, so you're going to tell me
that it's okay for me that I'm just
[SPEAKER_08]: supposed to let Colton die because this is
not an FDA approved medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just, I was appalled.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could not believe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to, to see the, the same things
happening all over the United States,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and even in other countries,
I just, I just don't understand how people
[SPEAKER_08]: can't be more compassion, compassionate
about the life of a, of an individual,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, even with this COVID stuff,
you know, there are so many people that
[SPEAKER_08]: said it, well, if you can't survive it,
then you're not supposed to survive it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, but you know, just stay in your
house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, but you know, Colton makes a
difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he tries to make a difference in
the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're telling me that his difference
that he's made in the world isn't worth it
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: That he needs to just stay home and not,
so you can't wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Colton can actually go out and do the
things that he does to make your life
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the compassion and the,
and, and just the, the simplicity of,
[SPEAKER_08]: of all of this that just boggles my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just, I'm so glad to be able to
move into a journey in my life where I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: more, more woke.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish that I was even more woke,
but I used to be that dare mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I, you know, since cannabis saved
Colton's life, I'm looking at other things
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking, oh my gosh, what more is there
out there?
[SPEAKER_20]: Greatest dare mom transition ever,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the most epic I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike was diagnosed with, with different
cancers and quite a story and same thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colton.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grabbed a Bible.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just quite an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just walked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's coming in to work in the garden,
but I thought, you know what, jump in here
[SPEAKER_03]: and say hi, Mike, because.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy new year, Mike.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really nice to see that you have
absolutely kicked cancer's ass because I
[SPEAKER_20]: know it had a deep grasp on you.
[SPEAKER_20]: You were, you weren't the stage one guy.
[SPEAKER_20]: You were deep in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know what stage you would
call it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a, it was a crucial tumor that
needed to be removed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was tenacious because it kept
coming back and due to its rarity,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's well, that's why we were tackling it
with cannabis because they couldn't figure
[SPEAKER_12]: it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: They thought cutting it out would be good
enough, but no, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They removed a rib.
[SPEAKER_03]: They removed tumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had over 26 surgeries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's got quite an amazing story and
cannabis has since changed his life
[SPEAKER_03]: completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're on RSO daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets a, he went and got his own
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the machining house?
[SPEAKER_12]: The extract.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, mind blank now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mind blank, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, all these little things.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exact extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and I mean, me talking with
Michael bolt mushrooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to mention that turn
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for me, I was having bad migraine
and cluster headaches from my 28 foot
[SPEAKER_03]: fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2007, I took a micro dose of
mushrooms at 420 and my headaches never
[SPEAKER_03]: came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to, I couldn't handle my tension
headaches and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd be crazy using mushrooms in
the past, but I really became medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was going through that time with my
injuries and mushrooms was that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that next step of me being able to
move forward with what had happened to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely go down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microdosing is huge when it comes to
dealing with headaches and migraines for
[SPEAKER_03]: me myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know lots of testimonials that
people do the same thing and it's a great
[SPEAKER_03]: reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, enjoy your journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit of the time.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, right before you, uh,
he came in and introduced Mike,
[SPEAKER_20]: I was kind of thinking as Wendy was
talking and a few people in the,
[SPEAKER_20]: in the room were talking about what,
what it is.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is, you know, you just can't imagine
you're like, this is my child.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, what are you evil?
[SPEAKER_20]: And you start thinking, and I'm sure
they're just probably the wrong terms to
[SPEAKER_20]: think of it as they're just these opposing
forces, whether it's darkness and light or
[SPEAKER_20]: good and evil, try to get out of that
mentality.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause they're really both wings on the
same bird, but it really is this like
[SPEAKER_20]: opposing energy.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's built into all of life,
you know, all of life, entropy is all of
[SPEAKER_20]: life dies.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so you've got to just think that
without that opposing energy, there
[SPEAKER_20]: couldn't be the other side to the opposing
energy.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's this sort of journey that we take
and you just want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: you want everyone to just come on,
let's get everyone on side.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems to be an impossible factor.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's that there always has to be
both sides to the coin or the coin itself
[SPEAKER_20]: can't exist.
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems to be a very important part of
the illusion.
[SPEAKER_20]: That certainly on four or five grams of
dried psilocybin mushrooms, you can break
[SPEAKER_20]: through and experience something far,
far beyond that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Or maybe some LSD.
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember Sam telling us one time he
took, I don't know if it was a hundred or
[SPEAKER_20]: 200 or however many hits he took back in
the sixties and blacked out.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's, there are ways to experience,
to remove your consciousness from this
[SPEAKER_20]: five cents prison that it's currently
locked into.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, if you think of psychedelics as
a prosthetic that can take that
[SPEAKER_20]: consciousness out of this five cents
prison and move it beyond that into this,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, more wider, I would say view,
but really the language isn't there
[SPEAKER_20]: because it's beyond our senses,
but anyone that's experienced these
[SPEAKER_20]: substances in fairly large doses will be
up and down in their head right now with a
[SPEAKER_20]: somewhat pale look on their face and a bit
of fright in their soul because yeah,
[SPEAKER_20]: the ego, my favorite Terrence McKenna
quote, these compounds do not bathe the
[SPEAKER_20]: ego in a cloud of certitude.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's one of my favorites right there
from psilocybin in the sands of time.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you guys want to check out a great
talk, go YouTube psilocybin in the sands
[SPEAKER_20]: of talk.
[SPEAKER_20]: That shit will blow the back of your head
off.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was like 1986 at the SLM Institute
when he did it.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smiley faces.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy new year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really nice to see everybody today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alison really beautiful to see you all
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for your work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to the Ames Institute.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have so much deep gratitude for the work
that you all are doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're following it all the time and yeah,
so appreciative and everybody else out
[SPEAKER_13]: there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so beautiful to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I think it's a beautiful
representation of the fact that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we can't necessarily always rely
on our government or medical industry for
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really thankful that at least we
do have an alternative community of people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are turned on and that will go the
extra mile no matter what, because
[SPEAKER_05]: karmically in their hearts, they're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm thankful to this community of
people on and people that are listening
[SPEAKER_05]: because obviously there's amazing amounts
of people listening to that are equally as
[SPEAKER_05]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big love and respect to that community
that keeps this world a better place and
[SPEAKER_05]: keeps it taken.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just think that, you know,
as the cannabis culture and having been a
[SPEAKER_13]: part of it for the past 30 years,
pretty much was sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Time is totally rolling that, you know,
being a part of the traditional market
[SPEAKER_13]: made us not look towards, you know,
the government made us not look towards
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever politics, lobbying, anything,
because it just wasn't allowing us to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it seems like more and more people are
coming on board and things are becoming
[SPEAKER_13]: legalized, you know, and decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all because the medicine is
really doing the work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's people behind it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's us cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's people getting it out there,
totally illegally against all odds.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's the medicine that changes the
people.
[SPEAKER_13]: When people ingest it, that they feel
those transitional changes, even
[SPEAKER_13]: politicians now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're becoming more intelligent because
the food and the medicine that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: taking is of higher intelligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it brings our possibilities up and
that's what they don't want.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, them, they don't want that
intelligence to thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And places like Ames is like, you know,
Ames Institute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've talked about it
yet, but I mean, it's, it's like a ground
[SPEAKER_05]: zero spot for, you know, normalization
and, and, and maybe you could tell us more
[SPEAKER_05]: about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the, and the bridge, the bridge from,
from the work that we've been doing in
[SPEAKER_13]: the, in the, in the black market and the
traditional market.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now Ames has really taken it forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alison, I'd love to hear about what you,
what you've been up to and what,
[SPEAKER_13]: what you've been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned earlier that we're currently,
well, we do all kinds of psychedelics
[SPEAKER_10]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Standish is working on using ayahuasca
for cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: She has also put forth her first
documentation to get approval from the DEA
[SPEAKER_10]: to utilize ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_10]: She is also working with the McKenna's
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a steward to their property in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we will be using ayahuasca from
that, that, that community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I mentioned earlier, we are
currently working on a study for
[SPEAKER_10]: psilocybin end of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to bypass a decram and,
and using the right to try rule and
[SPEAKER_10]: getting attorneys involved to basically
sue on behalf of several of our clients to
[SPEAKER_10]: be able to use psilocybin for end of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: We currently do in office ketamine
assisted psychotherapy sessions.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do cannabis assisted psychotherapy
sessions.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's I can't, I can't tell you guys
enough, the power of the work it's like
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis was amazing or is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you take these people who are
hurt and just have tried every medication
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you give them some psychedelics
and you see the change.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like Marcus is saying that ego
dissolution, your ego gets in the way of
[SPEAKER_10]: whether, you know, it's seeing love or
whether it's letting go of hurt or loss.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the ego, ego gone, it really
allows someone to see another side of
[SPEAKER_10]: life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and I'm really lucky and so honored
every time I sit with someone on a
[SPEAKER_10]: psychedelic session or I support someone
in either teaching them how to micro dose
[SPEAKER_10]: or to do macro dosing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's an honor and a privilege to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, just, it's kind of like helping,
like you were saying, Marcus, take their
[SPEAKER_10]: soul to a, to like, a cleaner,
lighter space where that the constructs of
[SPEAKER_10]: everyday life don't have to apply.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, that's, that's kind of what
we're doing at Abe's.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, every day is different.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we deal with, with, with all
different kinds of clients that are
[SPEAKER_10]: looking for support.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I do ketamine in the office
and then I support micro and macro dosing
[SPEAKER_10]: of other psychedelics that are not yet
legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And our goal is to be able to do
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are, we have, we have gone through the
MDMA training through maps and now we're
[SPEAKER_10]: awaiting the DEA to approve our site.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gotten all the requirements of the
refrigerators and everything that MDMA is
[SPEAKER_10]: supposed to be kept in.
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately under Trump's
presidency, a lot of those DEA approvals
[SPEAKER_10]: have kind of stalled.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are hoping that with the new
presidential administration that we will
[SPEAKER_10]: have more, our site will be approved for
MDMA as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: That puts a big smile on my face for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we work with the Canadian,
we work with Salome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Salome has come down from the Canadian
Psychedelic Association.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's come down and we're kind of doing
work hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've been doing work with Salome as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's part of our community up here in
British Columbia and Seattle and the US
[SPEAKER_05]: and Hawaii and the ayahuasca vines of the
Big Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we did a really amazing talk
with Standish and Sunil and it was really
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful online.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone hasn't seen it, I'm not sure
exactly where to find it right this second
[SPEAKER_05]: just to say it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was an incredible panel with maps
just on cannabis and cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And other plant medicine and cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just blew my mind to sit with those
folks and just have a discussion.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like, wow, as much as 2020 has
been just so incredibly whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's all of the words.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even want to say one word because
it's all of the words.
[SPEAKER_13]: Still, the mushrooms are getting through.
[SPEAKER_13]: The mycelium is growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: The seeds are sprouting.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plant medicine is making its way into
almost regular conversation at regular
[SPEAKER_13]: dinner tables and regular suburbia all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just think that this is incredible
time for plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And totally we're getting such empowering
messages.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really giving us a lot of the
answers that we've been searching for that
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe science and this idealization of
continually isolating things to give us
[SPEAKER_13]: the answers of the great magic of the
unknown of why we're here and why we exist
[SPEAKER_13]: and where we're going to and where we came
from.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just seems like the plant medicine
is doing much better than, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: past science.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely reaching the masses.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always surprised when I get like an 80
year old grandma come in with like a
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Pollan book all dog eared and
she's like, help me do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take, you know, these little old ladies
more so than I ever saw in cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: because these are these are ladies that
are not necessarily sick, but they just
[SPEAKER_10]: want to know like they want to find peace
and death.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to find peace with with their
past.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's and they're really they've never
some of them have never done psychedelics
[SPEAKER_10]: before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just want to like find out what
is this magic that goes on with looking
[SPEAKER_10]: inside the mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I definitely see psychedelics touching
the masses a lot more since since the
[SPEAKER_10]: acceptance of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a great healing to one that a lot of
our veterans are finding exponentially.
[SPEAKER_22]: I started a kind of a group with loose
affiliation with various veterans from all
[SPEAKER_22]: over the United States.
[SPEAKER_22]: And now we have ones from Canada who are
joining us because we're finding not just
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabis is helpful, but especially
working through our post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_22]: to arrive at our post-traumatic growth.
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things we find is definitely
psychedelics of various ones help kill
[SPEAKER_22]: that ego so that they can get past their
trauma so that they can finally arrive at
[SPEAKER_22]: their healing.
[SPEAKER_22]: It definitely is a clear of the past.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to give a shout out to my
Veterans Action Council brothers and
[SPEAKER_22]: sisters there for our continued work,
because that's one of the things we're
[SPEAKER_22]: working towards in the new year is
continuing opening up access, especially
[SPEAKER_22]: for veterans, because we're just a small
encapsulation of society.
[SPEAKER_22]: But such a concentration of society,
its reflection reflects back.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we just want to lend our hands and our
ears and our minds as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think one of the important things we're
going to find in the next 10 years as
[SPEAKER_20]: well, as we do with everything,
we we scrub all the culture out of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: We do everything in a very sort of clean
style room.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that the set and setting and
the importance of learning that and
[SPEAKER_20]: everyone learns that when they have their
first maybe took too much whatever at the
[SPEAKER_20]: wrong spot.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was kind of like, wow, that was that
was certainly not the same as it usually
[SPEAKER_20]: is.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was kind of a bad experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I guess, taking acid and going to
the bar and playing pool wasn't as good of
[SPEAKER_20]: an idea as we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so you can see how the set and
setting.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wonder where that will take us,
this set and setting, because will it be
[SPEAKER_20]: in a room with walls and ceilings and or
will it be outside?
[SPEAKER_20]: Will it be more like, you know,
because we have these two things.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have these ayahuasca ceremonies that
are happening in South America and in
[SPEAKER_20]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they definitely happen in different
types of huts.
[SPEAKER_20]: They have these traditional settings that
have been in place for many, many,
[SPEAKER_20]: many decades.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you have sort of the Western
society's version, which we do with
[SPEAKER_20]: everything, even the way we grow cannabis,
we scrub the entire terroir right out of
[SPEAKER_20]: the entire cannabis growing experience,
which could you imagine ever suggesting
[SPEAKER_20]: that?
[SPEAKER_20]: To the wine folk like, hey, we should
scrub the terroir out of grapes and grow
[SPEAKER_20]: them indoors with like lights and white
poly walls.
[SPEAKER_20]: And like, what do you think of that idea?
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like, so I hope we don't scrub
out that terroir culture from the
[SPEAKER_20]: psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things we are working towards
right now in the Veterans Action Council
[SPEAKER_22]: is SOPs.
[SPEAKER_22]: We started reaching out to shamans and
others and realizing that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_22]: unfortunate sexual abuse that can happen
in these situations.
[SPEAKER_22]: MAPS has put out a situation.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're actually working on a white
paper.
[SPEAKER_22]: And Dr. Drayson, I would love to have your
input and look over because we're reaching
[SPEAKER_22]: out to the Native American shaman
community, the traditional shaman
[SPEAKER_22]: community, as well as reaching out to
MAPS, because we realize that a lot of
[SPEAKER_22]: people want to imbibe and want to go
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: But at the same time, they don't know how
to prep themselves, where they need to be,
[SPEAKER_22]: who needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, because people think that a
couple is there, but we got wind that a
[SPEAKER_22]: particular couple will abuse people while
they're under these psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we want to work on educating people so
that they can have the experience that
[SPEAKER_22]: they desire and not the one that they get.
[SPEAKER_10]: Etienne, I usually recommend people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for what I do, like, you know,
there are some you might hear some clinics
[SPEAKER_10]: that do just infusions, like whether it be
ketamine or underground therapists that do
[SPEAKER_10]: their individual work.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for what we do at our clinic,
it's absolutely imperative to develop a
[SPEAKER_10]: relationship over a period of time with
the person that you're going to be going
[SPEAKER_10]: on this journey with.
[SPEAKER_10]: I work with highly traumatized individuals
who've had years firefighting fighters,
[SPEAKER_10]: police officers, people who've been raped
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those type of individuals really
require trust.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know MAPS does the two people in our
office.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one therapist.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we do is that we develop a
therapeutic relationship over a period of
[SPEAKER_10]: time prior to giving that person
psychedelics and sitting with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that seems for me to help a client
develop that trust.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm absolutely open to reading your
paper and giving some feedback,
[SPEAKER_10]: because I think that this is in order for
anyone to let go of their ego in an
[SPEAKER_10]: environment, they really need to trust the
people that are going to be the holder of
[SPEAKER_10]: their bodies.
[SPEAKER_22]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_22]: I put my email in the chat there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you could reach out, I'd love to
make contact for that because we just want
[SPEAKER_22]: to create a safety document so that when
people have or want to experience this,
[SPEAKER_22]: this just becomes sort of a go to document
so that they can understand that this is
[SPEAKER_22]: the way that should be done.
[SPEAKER_22]: So appreciate your input and thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an energy behind the medicine
that's being taken to and the way that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's cultivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've learned through cannabis about
conscious cannabis cultivation and how
[SPEAKER_05]: it's affecting the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've learned that it's easier to
assimilate the effects from regenerative
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis into the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to assimilate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with psychedelic mushrooms,
I mean, they could be grown in a super
[SPEAKER_05]: chemically laden situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, that's not positive for our
body, nor is it positive for the people
[SPEAKER_05]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the trip that we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: The use of isopropyl in the production of
psychedelic mushrooms is extremely harmful
[SPEAKER_05]: to our microbiome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you wouldn't want the cultivators to
get sick in the process of creating a
[SPEAKER_05]: cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's conscious ways of creating
psychedelics you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Marcus has been showing wavy
capsules, cyanescence in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are woody mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: People can create woody patches on their
land and create a lot of medicine in those
[SPEAKER_05]: areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talk about the epigenetics of the
trip.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is she breaking up for you guys as well?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to add to what you were saying
is that I've never in my life heard of so
[SPEAKER_10]: many people growing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: These little ladies coming in to visit me
at the office, they're growing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every Tom, Dick and Harry is growing
mushrooms at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: I live in the Pacific Northwest,
so it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or creating new strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was what I was going to, Dragonfly,
I was going to touch on is that what's
[SPEAKER_10]: seeming to happen now is that people are
putting two different types of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_10]: in a tub.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then how would you describe it is that
then they just choose the spores of the
[SPEAKER_10]: big fatty ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they continue to propagate the
big fatty ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that doesn't necessarily mean that the
traits of that particular mushroom are the
[SPEAKER_10]: best just because it looks big.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this constant need for bigger,
better quads.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to look for quads in
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Size doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Six star mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_20]: Listen, I will even add it's more
important than that because anyone that's
[SPEAKER_20]: ever grown mushrooms knows that when you
take a trip of the little aborts,
[SPEAKER_20]: the little mushrooms, that don't make it,
the caps that don't open up, they're tiny
[SPEAKER_20]: little babies.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, listen, primordial heads.
[SPEAKER_20]: Listen, those things, I swear to God,
I don't know if this is a fact,
[SPEAKER_20]: but this is what it seems like when you
eat them.
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems as though they've produced all of
their psilocybin and psilocin when they're
[SPEAKER_20]: this big.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you eat a gram of those and it's
literally like eating five grams of like
[SPEAKER_20]: big, huge, giant, you know, three foot
mushrooms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if they're fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner is agreeing with what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_20]: My psychedelic journeys have agreed with
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the Pacific Northwest, there's a lot of
foraging that goes on here, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to the science, we also have
spring and fall oviods, which is another
[SPEAKER_10]: type of psychedelic mushroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, on the coast,
we have the azorescence.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're in like the Mecca here in the
Pacific Northwest for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Seattle has gone on the attack to
kill the mushrooms because they used to
[SPEAKER_05]: have wood chips all over the city and
psychedelic mushrooms grew all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: city.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Certain cities are adding fungicides to
their wood chips so that they do not grow
[SPEAKER_10]: the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's mostly up in Bellingham,
we're hearing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bellingham has fungicide in the chips.
[SPEAKER_10]: But here in Seattle, the fungicide hasn't
really taken over.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner is a master forager.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so he spends his fall and spring out
in the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, he's invited up to Vancouver to come
spend it with us this next fall because
[SPEAKER_20]: we're doing the very same thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're pulling morels.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're pulling yellow foots, which you see
behind me.
[SPEAKER_20]: All varieties of gold, chanterelles,
lobster mushrooms, cauliflower mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_20]: bolites, a whole variety of wonderful
edible mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_20]: I ate my fair share of edible mushrooms
this fall.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_20]: We would just go every single weekend.
[SPEAKER_20]: Shout out to Shawn Michaels, the very same
Shawn Michaels that did the pointillism
[SPEAKER_20]: work on my bubble man guy that sits on the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's been foraging also for the last 20
years here, fungi and plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a huge bonus.
[SPEAKER_20]: But you guys should come up and we should
share some picking stories and some
[SPEAKER_20]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone needs to come to Illinois and help
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have tons of mushrooms here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Illinois has medicinal polypores
on your trees in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have 70 acres of just woods that my
family owns.
[SPEAKER_08]: We mushroom hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: But mushroom hunting morels, which go for
like $500 a pound around here because
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone loves them so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we look at all these other little
mushrooms that are around and we're like,
[SPEAKER_08]: which ones can we eat?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which ones can we not?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we live, the area that we live in is
where the three rivers come together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really moist here and there's a
lot of humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So someone needs to come and show this
area.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have some spores and spore some
of your hardwood bark.
[SPEAKER_20]: What about a special show on mushrooms,
both edible and psychedelic, where we
[SPEAKER_20]: gather some of the great minds and we
educate ourselves like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know how many times I've
gotten on to Hash Church and I've been
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I don't know enough about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys all blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Simplify it for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just now getting into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to know which mushrooms are good,
which mushrooms are bad, where to find
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just simplify it just for the layman
so we can get more.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good if you're a human, bad if you're a
bug.
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_20]: And not found in Illinois either.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was wanting to say that the
incredible positive reactions that we've
[SPEAKER_13]: gotten from compounding cannabis with
medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: So adding that in there, the incredible
importance of these adaptogens going
[SPEAKER_13]: together and creating medicine together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some Mycocana caps.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was really fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, turkey tail, lion's mane,
all of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner just said that it's actually
illegal to possess.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is legal to possess spores in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so you can get spores.
[SPEAKER_05]: More powerful than the fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a good thing to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it true that spores are illegal in all
50 states to hold?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're illegal in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're illegal in California.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it true that spores are the only other
living creature to leave Earth aside from
[SPEAKER_20]: humans and float in space trapped in
cosmic radiation pressure?
[SPEAKER_20]: Just putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_22]: Water bears as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, water.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_20]: What do they call it again?
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a weird name.
[SPEAKER_20]: They just took those things to the moon
recently.
[SPEAKER_20]: The strongest living organism,
those weird little creatures that have the
[SPEAKER_20]: snout mouths.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're like microscopic.
[SPEAKER_20]: No, nobody.
[SPEAKER_22]: Tardigrades.
[SPEAKER_22]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_20]: Tardigrades.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a small group.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a small group.
[SPEAKER_22]: Six-legged creatures that can survive in
space.
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, it'd be great to know about if
actually spores do actually travel through
[SPEAKER_22]: space because, you know, how long have
they been traveling?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: And where did they come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: We need all these questions answered.
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, can you imagine space mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_20]: I want some space mushrooms as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: For all we know, we have them already.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are space mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we're pretending right now that
we're not in space.
[SPEAKER_05]: ATN, have you ever tried the
Cyanofranciscans, the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_05]: mushrooms that are found in Oakland?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure it's like in a jack in the
box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking lot or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if they're a newer variety of
psychedelics that's been discovered in the
[SPEAKER_05]: last maybe 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there wasn't a clinical name for them
because they were new.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've, you know, taken them and had
some chance to try and grow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know about the Oakland
psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_22]: I have heard of it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not tried it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And if anybody who sees me, who knows me
and wants to and has access to,
[SPEAKER_22]: I would love to try them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm pretty sure if someone's watching
the chat, from what I've been told on the
[SPEAKER_05]: on the street, you know, it's called the
Cyanofranciscans.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it probably should be called the
Cyanofranciscans.
[SPEAKER_20]: There are mushrooms that you don't try.
[SPEAKER_20]: They actually try.
[SPEAKER_20]: They try you.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way it usually goes,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and with psychedelics,
there's there's there's manure loving
[SPEAKER_05]: cubensis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them are manure loving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are a lot of the ones that are
grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can cultivate them in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_22]: How would you rate the high of that
mushroom?
[SPEAKER_22]: Was it a solid ego kill?
[SPEAKER_10]: Which mushroom?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Oakland Franciscan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very visually pleasing,
very visually pleasing and had a,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, super silly note to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like a little bit
reminiscent to the to the Cyanessence,
[SPEAKER_13]: to the very, very sparkly, more sparkly
than I'd had mushrooms in a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of, like, really activated colors and
sparkles.
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you guys have you guys tried
Baeocystans?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because those often produce the visuals
with Baeocystans and Norbaeocystans.
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are bluebells and grow also in and
around like Maple Ridge and stuff in
[SPEAKER_20]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've tried those before.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the good ones we had recently was
the albino penis envy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ape.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, really incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wow, they look insane,
you know, and the trip was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_20]: You just eat on them like, you know,
I feel I feel like I should be welcoming
[SPEAKER_20]: both Stunkman Sam and Best Friend Farms
into the room.
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I kind of shit the bed on
welcoming those two guys to the room.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got sucked into the mushroom talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_20]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're like the guy on the cell phone
commercial.
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_04]: He patented all the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say one thing,
and that is we've been through a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: this before, the psychedelic revolution in
the 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think our big mistake then was,
OK, we took psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did kill our ego.
[SPEAKER_04]: That served a purpose to let us understand
ourselves better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the trouble was back then Larry used
to preach turn on, tune in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And drop out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to drop out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to turn in, turn on, excuse me,
tune in and take over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that's the goal is to take over
because if we don't, we have the morons in
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're stupid enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need even stupider people telling
us what to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: Ain't that so?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to tell you, go ahead,
kill your ego, turn on, tune in,
[SPEAKER_04]: but take over.
[SPEAKER_22]: And overgrow.
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't forget to spread the overgrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myceliate the system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let the mushrooms and the plant
medicine take over.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just steward it into the system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mycelium.
[SPEAKER_13]: We like to spread mycelium everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to throw in a thought here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the conversation about killing the
ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, that was my experience with
psychedelics earlier in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I came to realize that actually it's
not so much about killing the ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about coming to understand that the
ego doesn't have to be in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ego does serve a function in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, psychedelics took the illusion
away that all of this physical plane
[SPEAKER_00]: reality is what's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been years since I've used any
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get really high on love these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love of my life, love of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fortunate enough to shelter in place
on a farm where I can walk the land and
[SPEAKER_00]: really drink deeply of how beautiful it is
when it rains finally in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get really high that way because
psychedelics early in my life helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize that all of the stress and the
fear and the anger that I could find in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life was an illusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was based on attachment,
as Marcus alluded to earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to encourage people to,
yes, use psychedelics to help you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: illusion that seems so real that we call
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yes, life is suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's true is within each of us,
there's this place that psychedelics helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you experience where you can carry it
forward in your life day to day,
[SPEAKER_00]: moment to moment without the need to
constantly microdose or to macrodose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly encourage anyone that hasn't
tried the psychedelic experience to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to recognize that it's helping
you see truth as versus is truth itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to pitch that in there.
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate everything you just said,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also appreciate the tone in which
you said it.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was very calming and just enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate you sharing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to throw something out there
that I've been holding on to for a little
[SPEAKER_10]: while now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about Horatio a little bit
today, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a piece of jewelry that he and his
wife created before he died.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to make sure we talk a
little bit about Horatio today.
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we had a whole show for Horatio.
[SPEAKER_20]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard a few of them today as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: He was definitely a brilliant mind and
really an incredible actor.
He's also a great friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have a lot of energy that is
definitely missed here in our communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's surrounded in this building.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is all over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of Horatio memory and Alison,
I have something here for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have these special little aluminum balls
that are steel balls of Horatio.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was part of his leaving extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So certain people in this group,
if you please send me an email,
[SPEAKER_03]: I will ship you one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alison, you're one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was paying Etchen, anybody here who was
involved with Horatio and was part of that
[SPEAKER_03]: family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saved these and I've talked with Marnie
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just talked around New Year's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are in memory of a great mind
and a great soul and a great person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even think I've had a chance to
give you one, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been out because of COVID and
I'm staying home, but I can put these in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the people that are abroad,
I'll ship them to Amsterdam, Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain, wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about having that memory of someone
who was so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just people in and we've talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have my email, it's quite
easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just send it to medchanercanada
.gmail.com to certain people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But please contact me and I'll send you a
little piece of someone who is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big part of what he did and it's
pretty, they smell like what you mean too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found some of my old limonene hash oil
that I had been hoarding.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course it doesn't look the same,
but it still was like just to smell it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you could still smell light trace,
like very light traces of limonene.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was an interesting fellow and he
really, was a historical piece of the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis movement, a quiet one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than on Hashtag, he was really quiet
and kind of kept himself and lived in his
[SPEAKER_10]: little house in the woods with his family.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also too have been in touch with
Marnie.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a few pieces of his jewelry and some
stickers and stuff that was from some of
[SPEAKER_10]: his containers and just broke my heart
that he left us way too soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sit here and look at the tricone on the
microscope and just go down the research
[SPEAKER_03]: path of what we all do and what he did and
how we all inspired one another here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big part of all of us in Hash
Church is the inspiration we all gave one
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Horatio is one of those ones that
inspired us to move forward like we all
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do here every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome to take a look at the
journey that has happened with Hash Church
[SPEAKER_03]: and the surrounding people in the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have just keep pushing forward to just see
this plant grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to just to bring him up a
little because, you know, he's was a
[SPEAKER_10]: special part of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, he was definitely a fan
favorite.
[SPEAKER_20]: Lots of people always loved listening to
what Horatio had to share.
[SPEAKER_20]: And a thinker, innovator, you know,
definitely was playing around where,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, we've got people going off about
tech in the in the chat right now,
[SPEAKER_20]: upset that certain texts haven't been
shared.
[SPEAKER_20]: But Horatio's texts, you know,
were unable to be shared because of the
[SPEAKER_20]: danger they they posed to people playing
around with them.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he didn't want to be giving tech to
people and then having them hurt
[SPEAKER_20]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, you know, you can see that it's
not just black and white.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, people want tech.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so they feel that complaining about it
is how they can get it.
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's not it's not always doesn't
always work out that way.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I remember talking to him
about, you know, when I went and filmed
[SPEAKER_20]: Horatio's inner sanctum and how
controlling he was in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he really wanted to make sure that I
didn't share anything that, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe people would get a hold of and and
hurt themselves doing so.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, that that was some chemistry
that he was playing around with there.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I kind of respected it that he that he
wanted to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I personally was very honored to
be able to go into his lab because I know
[SPEAKER_20]: very, very few people ever got invited in
there and to be able to film as well with
[SPEAKER_20]: him puts that that puts that out there
that I'll never take that video down.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, that'll be available to people
to go in and to to watch and check out and
[SPEAKER_20]: visit with Horatio, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it called Cannabis Economy?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you and Horatio introduced the Terp
Shannon campaign.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, like, there were people who were
in that setting that had no idea about
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terp campaign.
[SPEAKER_10]: To all of those folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, everyone in chat, whatever it
is you're doing, pick up your pipes,
[SPEAKER_20]: your joints.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're having a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colton's going to go get his vape because
he doesn't dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just to remind everyone, his GoFundMe
is still up and you can donate to
[SPEAKER_08]: Horatio's GoFundMe still.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone out there who has been touched by
Horatio, please go to GoFundMe and and
[SPEAKER_08]: give a few dollars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I purchased she did an auction.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so some of the jewelry that they make,
I purchased some jewelry as a way of
[SPEAKER_10]: supporting the family.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so she's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: She still has those pieces.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not all of them went for auction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But behind that and the jewelry that was
made was actually is pretty cool because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a new form of attack that he had
actually came up with by fusing two
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds together to make the jewelry
that no one had done before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a completely new, as you know,
Horatio was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came up with something so amazingly
innovative.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was able to fuse these together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw what was going on with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I seen the molds and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: This jewelry is something special and it's
been great for the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great for the family to move on
because she'll be something that Martin
[SPEAKER_03]: will be working on and his daughter maybe
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's something to fuel that family and
keep that that vision going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of it's pretty cool,
Julia, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to his his Instagram page and
you'll see some of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got 600, just under 600 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm ready for a dabby.
[SPEAKER_20]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_20]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, bless your coughing.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a Johnny B action going on there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_20]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took some caps this morning,
the 240s, and I took two of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about 15 minutes in the hash church,
I was getting a little jittery and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a little anxiety, you know,
and I sat down and started smoking a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went for a walk, came back and had to
relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like I think I went to my
peak limit this morning.
[SPEAKER_20]: I ate some micro caps from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, and I'm also rocking some host
[SPEAKER_20]: defense.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in Lion's Mane.
[SPEAKER_20]: Great for memory and nerve support.
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are my those are my daily medicines
right there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Boom, shankara.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been going hard on the mushrooms
lately, probably taking up to three
[SPEAKER_13]: heaping tablespoons of Lion's Mane,
three heaping tablespoons of turkey tail,
[SPEAKER_13]: and just started a 12 day water cleanse.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just going to go hard with the
mushrooms and the miso and just do water,
[SPEAKER_13]: mushrooms, and miso for 12 days and try to
get reset.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like coming into my 50th year,
I felt like it was really important to,
[SPEAKER_13]: well, having passed my 50th year,
felt like it was probably a good thing to
[SPEAKER_13]: do some cleansing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes when it's quiet,
it's a good time to go within.
[SPEAKER_13]: And realize that food and drinking and
external and all these things that we take
[SPEAKER_13]: into our lives really take up a lot of
time and energy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we sort of pull back from that
and do things that are good for our body,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that we learn more about ourselves
and we learn more about what's going on in
[SPEAKER_13]: the world today.
[SPEAKER_13]: So coming into 2021, I feel like I would
probably end it with a really beautiful,
[SPEAKER_13]: intentional journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some type of plant medicine journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: So loving those mushrooms also.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been taking so much oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so healing on so many levels to
mix the medicinal mushrooms with the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like they were made for each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of those mushrooms in there are
forged from our forests and we live on the
[SPEAKER_05]: edge of a wilderness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like eating longevity enzymes,
you know, with- Longevity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Longevity enzymes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the polypore is like who gets
artist conks and amadou and the red belted
[SPEAKER_05]: conk and we slice them up and make oil out
of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the oil of the mushrooms itself is
just- There it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Red belted polypore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Slice it up and just stuff the pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pull a polypore off like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slice it with a knife to a little thing
and chew on it while I'm- And then if you
[SPEAKER_13]: put the slices together overnight in a
basket, they will myceliate on top of each
[SPEAKER_13]: other.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you took that and you sliced it,
it's like you could make a thousand of
[SPEAKER_13]: them from that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just want to continue to grow and
they seem to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's good to have some of the bark
still on the mushroom because the bark is
[SPEAKER_05]: healing as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cambium layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the mushroom is a fruit of the
cambium layer of the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that mycelium is where it's attached
to the lifeblood of the tree.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the intelligence of the tree and
all of the history of the tree and all the
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that the tree is uptake in is
in that polypore that Marcus is holding
[SPEAKER_13]: that then we can absorb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we can't absorb the tree,
but we can absorb the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that dried mushroom that Marcus had
still has a lot of the medicine in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does store in there dry,
but it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nearly impossible to cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably burn that too,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know whether you want to
burn that one or not, but those mushrooms
[SPEAKER_05]: when dry also burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like this is and also the smelling the
smoke from a polypore like chaga and
[SPEAKER_05]: amadou, the tinder conch, smelling the
smoke is healing to the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of native peoples used that as
an incense in their smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you can smoke this polypore.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take a little slice of it and put
it in a Vitamix and kind of make it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it goes furry when you try and blend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't like chip up, but you can mix
it with cannabis and smoke it in a doobie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really good for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fantastic fungicide.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really helpful for damp lung issues,
people with consumption.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of the native people had it like
Josh was saying in their medicine bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it helps rid pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we always burn it through our
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: We burn them in our basements.
[SPEAKER_13]: We really, you know, take advantage of
this cleansing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's another really awesome example.
[SPEAKER_13]: Same thing that Marcus was showing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is off a birch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the red belted conch is the
Phomatopsis pinacola, which is generally
[SPEAKER_05]: off a pine tree, but this is from a birch
tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would have different compounds
because the birch has betulinic acid in
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really are stoked when we find
mushrooms off a birch tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our golden tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We eat the birch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We eat the bark of the birch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We drink the birch bark because you can't
eat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can do a lot of things,
but.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on birch, this chaga.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Today really became a mushroom church.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to have to do like a,
I'm going to have to start a mushroom show
[SPEAKER_20]: where we share mushroom information and do
maybe not every week by any means,
[SPEAKER_20]: but be good to do a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe I could ask all of you to help
collect some names and contact information
[SPEAKER_20]: for the people that would want,
which should be, you know, invited to such
[SPEAKER_20]: a discussion.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that between the people just on
the panel here right now, we could
[SPEAKER_20]: probably put together 50 to a hundred
names pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could encourage the growing of
mushrooms together with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially for the backyard and home
grower, because a lot of medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: mushrooms like maitake, lion's mane,
reishi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those three are just ones that come off
the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can grow, they grow off wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can, if people are clearing their
forest, blah, blah, they're fired,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can plug trees and put them in the
dirt underneath your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the trees will fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: These medicinal mushrooms underneath your
cannabis and they'll breathe together,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the mushrooms are breathing in
oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide with
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant, which is taking in and it's a
beautiful sick cyclical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you plant your mushrooms with
a mycorrhizal fungi, then you just have
[SPEAKER_05]: this completely living unbelievable
medicine that will, it'll transform your
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: That this is what we should do is try and
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wouldn't fruit maybe this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you, when you plug a tree,
it may or may not fruit, but it might
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we do it proper in the spring,
you know, and we've done that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And why not take on a higher intelligence?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I think that what we continue to do
is this circle game, almost like a gerbil
[SPEAKER_13]: inside of a cage that we continue to look
towards government and individuals and
[SPEAKER_13]: humans from all over the world for better
information.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like humans evolve together.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are all on this incredible collective
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to look towards other beings such
as plant medicines for us to evolve to
[SPEAKER_13]: that next level.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't be looking towards other humans.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to be, you know, evolving with the
medicines that are here for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just love it that, you know,
the mycelium continues to pop up in all
[SPEAKER_13]: little cities all over the place and
become decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and she's making her way,
you know, the cannabis sort of opened the
[SPEAKER_13]: door for all the rest of the plant
medicines to, to walk through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some cannabis farms are transforming
just to psilocybin production in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you can grow mushrooms towards
the greenhouse right next to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: green house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can exchange the air between the
two green houses, you know, and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: would have, you know, and, and science,
maybe someone is going to try and play
[SPEAKER_05]: with bad, but it's good because it will go
on to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone will prove that this is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those spores beyond the trichomes as
we consume them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it'll be more, it'll be third
instead of secondary metabolized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be like, what's the third?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tertiary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That tertiary.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tertiary metabolites just, and then it
will go into quads, which goes back to
[SPEAKER_05]: what we originally, which is really the
goal, you know, which, which is.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, the conversation take one.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a, there's also the aspect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have actually people send me stuff all
the time, like samples and stuff of things
[SPEAKER_10]: that they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the most interesting samples I
have are people who are microdosing
[SPEAKER_10]: decarboxylated cannabis and mushrooms and
caps for, for like a daily, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: booster.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, that's, that's, that's what we
do, Alison.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been compounding mushrooms and
cannabis oils, both THC, CBD, CBG,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, doing isolates full spectrum,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, for a very long time,
you know, realized that, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: the isolates were not helping.
[SPEAKER_13]: We already knew that as far as the studies
go, but you, you put it onto patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: No full spectrum, full, full, full soak
oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a coconut olive oil and like 17
different mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it seems to just help people with
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not throw it out there?
[SPEAKER_13]: We always give people the recipes.
[SPEAKER_13]: We tell people, do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's these amazing plants that,
that are showing themselves and we're
[SPEAKER_13]: becoming more educated from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's, let's make them in our own.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kitchens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's, let's heal each other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it that you've got somebody who's
doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: The more people who are compounding these
incredible, intelligent plants together
[SPEAKER_13]: and mushrooms are just going to be helping
us all out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just, it just helps raise us all up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people are starting to
take, you know, and turn it into account
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the power of what, you know,
specific terpenes can do and specific,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, varietal terpene, um, you know,
uh, that you, you know, you can really
[SPEAKER_06]: blend two different types of experiences
that, um, are quite complimentary to one
[SPEAKER_06]: another and quite really, really
beneficial to your everyday, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's really, it's, it's interesting
because we really are starting to touch on
[SPEAKER_06]: a very large palette and it starts to get
into this idea of biohacking and better
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding what you can do,
um, for yourself and being more
[SPEAKER_06]: self-sufficient and better understanding
your own body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then the energy that you can
connect to, um, by understanding these
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that, um,
it's really beautiful to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone around us kind of learning and
wanting to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and as you kind of illustrated before,
Kelly, it's, it's, it's so, it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we have abundance around us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important that, um,
you know, we, we connect with these
[SPEAKER_06]: medicines and are really responsible and
really, um, you know, it really,
[SPEAKER_06]: a way that allows us to really get in
touch with, with what's around us.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think in terms of terpenes,
there's a lot of work that's being done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, uh, you know, there's,
there's, there's quite a few people that
[SPEAKER_06]: are, that are on the verge of releasing a
lot of different products that
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Terrence McKinnon has been working
on some stuff that, that incorporates
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think a lot of people are really
working on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's just a matter of time right
now and better understanding how we can
[SPEAKER_06]: scale a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it, it's available for everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cultivar specific terpenes are very
hard to scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's a, it's, you know, the process in
which you need to go through to isolate
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, your returns are just not there
yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, however, you know, there, there are
the ways we can achieve what we're trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and the terpenes that are involved
in, in mushrooms, you know, the tri
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes and the terpenes and the
sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always love to say just, just for fun,
because I came to this on, on a journey is
[SPEAKER_13]: that is, you know, when if you take all
the crayons and you melt them all
[SPEAKER_13]: together, they're always brown.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always feel like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Broke up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Waking up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really think about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're, uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I bad at all the crayons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the crayons together made brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you, and then you take all the
crayons, you melt them, they make brown.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if you take all the terpenes in
the world and you melt them all together,
[SPEAKER_13]: it smells like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like there's really some
awesome, um, uh, horizons to expand on in
[SPEAKER_13]: terpene production, uh, in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just sent Marcus a, um, articles called
Trey, uh, Traversing the fungal terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_20]: The terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: The terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: One of them, their government sats,
the fungal terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to traverse the fungal terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, that is 100% the name of the
show, by the way, traversing the fungal
[SPEAKER_20]: terpenome.
[SPEAKER_20]: You just named the show.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the name of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not even a joke.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's happening for sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just can't believe how great that is.
[SPEAKER_22]: It rolls off the tongue so eloquently.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.
[SPEAKER_20]: You got a lot of people in the chat room
listening and chatting away.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how many of you guys are
visiting the chat room, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_20]: there's a solid 400 plus people in there
chatting away.
[SPEAKER_20]: Got a couple of good conversations going
on.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a lot of the old hard cores,
OGs.
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: When we ally with, with fungi,
we're, we're creating a bridge.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're helping our own fungi and bacterial
microbiome have communication,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, back to our very DNA, how we are able
to uptake these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I love the quote that we're 99.9%
identical as far as our DNA and 99.9%
[SPEAKER_13]: different as far as our microbiome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was reading last night that we have
380 trillion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Viruses or pathogens living in our body at
all times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the viroam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look up viroam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Online on the wick on, you know,
on and you'll find out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so the, the more that we can ally with
these incredibly intelligent, beneficial
[SPEAKER_13]: microbiology spores, fungi, it's going to
help us rise up and help create a higher
[SPEAKER_13]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I was saying before, because they're
so easily available for us to uptake.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just right there and, and,
and they communicate with our interior
[SPEAKER_13]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our brain, you know, they say,
you know, trust your gut because your gut
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe is more like your brain than your
brain, because there's so many more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organisms and microorganisms and thinking,
you know, thinking with your receptors in
[SPEAKER_05]: your neurology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your microbiome is in your nutrition
and your connection to soil is equally as
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_05]: As microdosing and as taking cannabis to
treat your ailments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without the full picture of,
of nutrition and earth connection and
[SPEAKER_05]: Schumann's resonance, and without these
things that connect us to the longevity of
[SPEAKER_05]: the earth, the earth is always going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, and our smartness, you know,
we may go away very easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always say we're trying to save the
earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: So funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we're trying to save ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: The earth is trying to save us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really need to listen because the
earth has the answers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And detour really quickly that we're
talking about our own microbiome.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also need to talk about these
cultivated plant medicines, microbiome,
[SPEAKER_13]: the endophytic system within the cannabis,
also the endophytic system within the
[SPEAKER_13]: mushrooms, the endophytic system within
all of the vines that we're taking and
[SPEAKER_13]: making medicine out of.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need these medicines to be included.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're incredibly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can gather that information.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, people have bad trips on
mushrooms, not just because they are
[SPEAKER_13]: thought it was a good idea to go to the
movies or, you know, had a bad epigenetic
[SPEAKER_13]: situation, but also they took bad
mushrooms, the same as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: We all know what it's like to take a
really big hit of some chemi weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just spins you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not just any mushroom is good for
you or any this good for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to really know your source,
know your farmer, ask your farmer to rise
[SPEAKER_05]: above and create intelligent medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rise up H I Z, rise up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And into my regimen, actually,
if it makes perfect sense, the
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation for even into the organic
indoor, I was taught how to make my
[SPEAKER_07]: psyllium flats out West from soil scape
solutions friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been using that for, yeah,
Sam and Natalie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been using that method for
probably seven plus years in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get great fungal flat results on a
pretty good rhythm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really, without being scientific
about it, it opens up my terpenes and my
[SPEAKER_07]: oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get great fraction on the test back
we've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems like even back from the
extractor friends like ancient green,
[SPEAKER_07]: for instance, those friends that we're
seeing better high quality results out of
[SPEAKER_07]: it and full terpene profile and just
amazing results from the mushrooms into
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil life for regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on rinse on repeat for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_20]: That is what's up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to shout out my six year old who I'm
taking care of today as my wife is off
[SPEAKER_20]: having a little rest and relaxation.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's been incredible and has not bothered
me a single time.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just taking care of himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the new COVID mouse for 2021 for
all you smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually got a hole here so you can
smoke your joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're finished, I have these
custom made and there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the COVID mouse for 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually girlfriend's mother who
came up with the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And got to be safe out there for 2021,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to still be able to puff so this
way you don't have to take off your mask.
[SPEAKER_20]: Or just go to a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just go to a restaurant because it doesn't
matter how many people are in the
[SPEAKER_20]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're just allowed to take your mask off
when you go in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, it was just the, I had 42
delivered to the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people are getting these in the
mail and it's be your 2021 present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, that is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_20]: DK trades says that's hilarious,
John.
[SPEAKER_22]: You make them at big mouths for people
like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually the prototypes,
you can only put penners in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I need to be able to put a joint
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually the water said a big pen,
just give me a blank enough so I can put
[SPEAKER_03]: like a big pen in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she laughed, but that's the size that
you need to take a smokey fatty,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like a Sharpie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause my first ones I had, I had stains in
the front cause I was smoking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she came up with the idea of making us,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's different prototypes,
but you know, be inventive for 2021,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you're going to do and spread the
word about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, I have a full bandana that I
can go into the bank with that has the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing.
All right.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to ask Sam, why is your guy
backwards?
[SPEAKER_22]: Is he okay?
[SPEAKER_22]: Is, is cat in the head?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now he's gone.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I've done it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You've done it yet.
[SPEAKER_20]: No more.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, oh, he's got his mask on.
[SPEAKER_22]: He's got his mask.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't want to get a computer virus.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, remember boys and girls, it's not a
dad joke until it's full grown.
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's going on in Amsterdam there,
Sam is the, uh, is COVID ripping through
[SPEAKER_20]: your friends and family, or is it really
not that you don't see it too much?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I, I saw it around and uh,
but I think Amsterdam itself must be
[SPEAKER_04]: getting worse because all the restaurants
are closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the schools are closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's not doing so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always like the holy grail is full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, I mean, I always thought that for
smoking anyway, what you want is THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really want the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may want particular terpenes that you
enjoy, whether it's a Mersin for punch or
[SPEAKER_04]: limaline for up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, I, I always hear about full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's the holy grail, but it's,
I just don't see it for, uh, for
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't see it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, cause your holy grail is THC with
lots of terps.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the thing about cannabis is that
everyone has a different holy grail.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also will say that when I heard
that, I also thought, I always think this
[SPEAKER_20]: when I hear people say, Oh, you know,
isolates are no good.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think, okay, just a second time out.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, what about, uh, you know, someone like
Haley Rose who has this, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: neurological disorder, super sensitive.
[SPEAKER_20]: They created the Haley's Comet for high
CBD had certain ratios.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure John could go on for hours about
it because he has a close relationship
[SPEAKER_20]: with them.
[SPEAKER_20]: But what happened was it worked,
it worked, it worked.
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like whatever happened, something happened
in the terroir, something happened in the
[SPEAKER_20]: gross, something happened in the genetics
where things just changed a little bit,
[SPEAKER_20]: produced different things.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now all of a sudden it wasn't working
anymore.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I always thought that a value would be
like, listen, obviously we want,
[SPEAKER_20]: we want to take the whole plant apart.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we, we can actually decipher through
our own bioassays what it is that's
[SPEAKER_20]: happening.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this, you know, this full spectrum
versus microns of hash versus certain ones
[SPEAKER_20]: put together with other terpenes from
different, just let us do it all.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's dive into this as deep as we
possibly can and uncover all these
[SPEAKER_20]: complexities so that we can A,
which we always all at least claim that
[SPEAKER_20]: the patients are the most important.
[SPEAKER_20]: We can send that data over to patients and
be like, look, if you're someone like
[SPEAKER_20]: Haley and you require a company to
monomolecularize and isolate every
[SPEAKER_20]: compound so they can build it back to
something that they are copying from a
[SPEAKER_20]: full spectrum state of perspective,
like of a plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: They've done the full lab test.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're going to take all their
monomoleculars and terpene fractions,
[SPEAKER_20]: and they're going to put that back
together the best that they can to the
[SPEAKER_20]: point where it never changes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that someone with a neurological
disorder, or maybe even someone like
[SPEAKER_20]: Colton, who has super sensitivities in,
in the intestinal region, any little
[SPEAKER_20]: amount of anything that's off,
he's going to feel that like strong.
[SPEAKER_20]: So value of monomolecular.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's the end.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's also the value that we can take it
all apart.
[SPEAKER_20]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the first time Sam put a bowl of
pure THC in my bowl.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it was neat.
[SPEAKER_20]: I smoked it, but then, you know,
I was all ready to be excited about it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was like, well, how was it?
[SPEAKER_20]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_20]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Just right in your face.
[SPEAKER_20]: Super excited.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, well, I guess in a sense,
it was a little one-dimensional and then
[SPEAKER_20]: hitting it with that one single terpene
that wasn't even cannabis derived just to
[SPEAKER_20]: experience that sort of, whoa,
this is different to me.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all valuable.
[SPEAKER_20]: We should never get caught up in our
division.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all, whatever perspective you're
going down, that can be your Holy grail
[SPEAKER_20]: and all facilitate you getting as far down
that road as possible, but let's not shit
[SPEAKER_20]: on all the other roads.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause there's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_20]: So Sam, we know what your road is.
[SPEAKER_20]: We appreciate your road.
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of us have traveled your road.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks to you pioneering and breaking
ground and putting that road in for many
[SPEAKER_20]: of us.
[SPEAKER_20]: So huge.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_20]: But also thanks to people like you.
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you to everybody at Colton who
are discovering new roads for different
[SPEAKER_20]: people in different times and different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how we have discovered that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Roads is definitely the best analogy to go
there because we always say that,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, a person's endocannabinoid
system is like a road and every road has
[SPEAKER_16]: potholes in it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have to figure out, you know,
what you need to fill those potholes,
[SPEAKER_16]: make sure that you don't, you know,
if you add too much, then it gets,
[SPEAKER_16]: the road gets bumpy.
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't get enough.
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't build those potholes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we discovered that, you know,
there are, you know, can there are
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids that I can't have.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's this cannabinoid called THCV,
which is an appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_16]: So first off, whoever thought of weed that
didn't give you the munchies that,
[SPEAKER_16]: that, you know, when we first figured that
out, that blew my mind, but it's an
[SPEAKER_16]: appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_16]: So for people with diabetes who just want
to lose weight, and I also hear that it's
[SPEAKER_16]: working really well for people with a
post-traumatic stress disorder,
[SPEAKER_16]: they're using it with great success,
but it's an appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_16]: So someone like me who has a wasting
syndrome, I can't have THCV.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are, you know, cannabinoids that
people, you know, should be looking at and
[SPEAKER_16]: analyzing and deciding, you know,
is this what's best for me?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there are, you know, some
cannabinoids that people either can't
[SPEAKER_16]: handle or can't have, and we need to know
that information as patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if we're taking this as a
medicine, we need to know what everything
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're putting into our bodies is
doing to our bodies.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need that information.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to empower you to the most
degree to get the combination or terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: or cannabinoid that benefits you and none
of the ones that don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's what our trial and
error has been through this whole journey,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that, you know, we were the full
spectrum family.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got into cannabis and everybody would
say, full spectrum, full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_08]: full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, CBG has done a lot of good for a
lot of people in CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we understand that situation,
but we also understand it as a medicine
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that specific combinations or specific
terpenes or specific cannabinoids do set
[SPEAKER_08]: harm to other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we discovered that on accident by
Colton's medicine and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: getting a strain for him that had a lot of
THCV in it, which cannabis doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of THCV in it, but this was one
strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, and I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_17]: South African.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might've been.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we, it may have been it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, we just know that whatever,
what the difference in the medicine that
[SPEAKER_08]: he was taking was THCB.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, we noticed that when we gave him
babes that had THCV in it, that he would
[SPEAKER_08]: start losing weight and he lost it
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was one of the scariest things
for me is because trying to get him to a
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred pounds is difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to maintain that is even worse.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it was difficult.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm 115.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we figured that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, we've tried to avoid THCB at all
costs because for like, for him,
[SPEAKER_08]: it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, like he said, for people with
diabetes, it's excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love for somebody to just maintain
a THCB.
I'm trying to get him to a hundred pounds
for his, for his weight loss.
And it's not gonna be, it's not gonna be,
he's not gonna be able to work out... The
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers are going to be, you know,
like a, if it's a, like a pill that was
[SPEAKER_08]: THCV for weight loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was, whoever does that is
going to be a billionaire.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Frankenstein, I think
Frankensteining it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, we have to understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: it's okay to do because we have certain
patients that need certain things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also want to have other
cannabinoids involved and terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: involved and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want everything, but we want specific
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that there is a place for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that I think all of
these points are really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's happening is we're missing an
incredible bridge.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's allowing the plant and the
cultivator to have those conversations for
[SPEAKER_13]: the greater people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like when science continues to,
and this is just like a side of it,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, we have all different things and
I respect everybody in the conversation
[SPEAKER_13]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I got to stick up for the plant here
in that she has these capabilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: When we talk about full spectrum,
we're talking about that full plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: what that full plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've learned and you all have learned
that THCV is not good for Colton.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's really easy to get a varietal
that doesn't have THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really easy to get a varietal that
doesn't have the CBG.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easy to get a varietal that has
exactly the terpene ratios, everything
[SPEAKER_13]: that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have the plant grow it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And by saying that we synthesize it and
take this terpene and that terpene and we
[SPEAKER_13]: mix it together and we're humans and we're
scientists and we're going to do it better
[SPEAKER_13]: than the plant can.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just really feel like we're missing
something very important here that of
[SPEAKER_13]: course we need science to say,
yeah, this terpene is good.
[SPEAKER_13]: This cannabinoid was helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: This wasn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's allow the plant to create the
medicine for the people rather than
[SPEAKER_13]: science laboratories creating it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get that beautiful connection to the
growers and to the strains that you need
[SPEAKER_13]: Colton that can be grown regeneratively,
that can be done well.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the problem is that you're in
Illinois and there's still all this sort
[SPEAKER_13]: of, you know, heavy duty oppression on the
plant that needs to be lifted.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to allow the plant to do what she
does and stop outsmarting her and
[SPEAKER_13]: ourselves in thinking that we're going to
do a better job.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sticking up for the plants in that
way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we talk about full spectrum,
we're talking about the fullness of that
[SPEAKER_13]: particular plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're using that whole plant, that whole
varietal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we agree with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we think that a whole plant,
a whole spectrum is very beneficial for so
[SPEAKER_08]: many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also see the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could find a plant that would be
great for Colton and we wouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_08]: take it apart and we wouldn't have to
figure out what terpenes or what
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids work and what don't in his
body.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the only thing that we grew for
his medicine for people with Crohn's
[SPEAKER_08]: disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then that would be so amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like you said, everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have their own potholes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we have to learn how to
fill them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis, I've taken cannabis a million
times and I don't see the benefits in me
[SPEAKER_08]: that I see in him because it just doesn't
work as well for me for whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm a pretty healthy person.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't really have a whole lot going
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, everybody is so different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wish that we could just figure out
like, you know, like Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and I know that this is like
insane, but you take 500 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_08]: Tylenol and your headache goes away for
most people.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with this plant, it's just not that
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's just so many varieties and so
many things that you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just, we're just at the cusp of
learning everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: That this plant can do and what is in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we still probably have not
discovered cannabinoids that is in this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant and what their powers are.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you're mentioning how important the
human element is in all of this,
[SPEAKER_20]: that the plant's not going to do
everything for us, that we are a major
[SPEAKER_20]: factor even in growing it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if we're growing it with salts and
we're not putting in that energy,
[SPEAKER_20]: yeah, there's a way to think that as a
human, you can do better and you start
[SPEAKER_20]: growing organically and regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's actually better.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was the human factor.
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you say, oh, humans think they're
going to take this plant and do better.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's actually what we're all kind
of doing with it at all times.
[SPEAKER_20]: So who's to draw the line where that
should stop.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, all I know is the plants aren't
all available at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hate when I see small children with
neurological disorders where cannabis
[SPEAKER_20]: helped them one grow and then two grow
down the line.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not helping them the same cultivar
anymore because something changed.
[SPEAKER_20]: The room got too hot.
[SPEAKER_20]: Something happened.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I do see a value in all of
it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I certainly wouldn't pick one over the
other.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think that we're so divided as
humans.
[SPEAKER_20]: We constantly have to put up a fence and
say, no, the grass is greener over here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, you know, no, it's actually greener
over here.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just rip that fence down, stand on the
edge and just say, look, let's be
[SPEAKER_20]: accepting of all of these different
potentials.
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as they're based in love and based
in trying to help and based in positivity
[SPEAKER_20]: and a greater outcome for the human race.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking about becoming some evil
corporate entity that holds these powers
[SPEAKER_20]: over the rest of the world, gets rid of
all plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wasn't also even talking about
synthesizing as much as isolating and then
[SPEAKER_20]: restructuring.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really kind of what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do appreciate your passion and did
very much hear what you had to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I thought what was interesting
is Kelly brought up the idea of a term we
[SPEAKER_06]: use, like we use broad spectrum and tea
free and these terms that are so full
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does full spectrum mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: What types of terpenes, what types of
cannabinoids are there?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I do think that it needs to be
further defined and further explored and
[SPEAKER_06]: we need to better understand our varietals
and how they're grown and what regions
[SPEAKER_06]: they're grown in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to really help us better
understand what the chemicals that the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant's producing are, you know,
what it consistently can produce and what
[SPEAKER_06]: those anomalies are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've seen in different
conditions spikes in THCA that in Delta 9
[SPEAKER_06]: that that are abnormal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and when it gets to cooler
temperatures and different feeding
[SPEAKER_06]: schedules, you see lower overall tack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of this stuff really attributes to
not only the environmental factors,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also the feeding, what you're giving
the rhizosphere, what type of inoculants
[SPEAKER_06]: are available, what type of cover crop is
even there to even sequester what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to sequester and then providing the
environment for it to actually sequester
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's a whole other topic in
itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it really is important for
us to have this dialogue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do appreciate that point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something we need to talk more
about because full spectrum is varietal
[SPEAKER_06]: specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's why we name these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We humanize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get closer to trying to grab onto it
with our human hands and better understand
[SPEAKER_06]: it by naming them and using naming notes
and glamors and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's super important because the
dialogue is all we have and it allows us
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of expand upon one another's
thought processes and and process ease as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you do everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And rather than seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say there is no true
full spectrum in the sense that there is
[SPEAKER_04]: no one variety of candidates that have all
150 of the terpenes and all 120 or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Words get in the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Words just get in the way because as soon
as you start using a word, you start going
[SPEAKER_05]: all over the place with the word.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it should be full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're using that whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the leading herbalists that use
herbs and things with patients on the
[SPEAKER_05]: daily for generations believe that not
cannabis is not the only answer towards
[SPEAKER_05]: full health and transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is one thing that a person would
use to transform their health and often
[SPEAKER_05]: compounding cannabis with other herbs is
the actual healing that's needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you're now your full spectrum is
including other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the idea is that diversity is
what we're missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you look at a person who's really
sick, a lot of times, if you dissect their
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiome, they have less living
organisms in their gut, enabling them to
[SPEAKER_05]: transform their nutrients and medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just got to say, oh, I need to up
my diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any person has their own reality and their
own world and their own things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: available to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a goal when you learn things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what science is good for.
[SPEAKER_05]: They teach us some things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just learn through intuition
to go farther.
[SPEAKER_05]: So diversity is the key to our survival
and longevity.
[SPEAKER_18]: You go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and you were saying that we have
different sides of things.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it's really different
sides as much as it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's holistic.
[SPEAKER_13]: What we need is we need more
conversations, more holistic views.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're always taught that there's this side
or there's that side or that this thing
[SPEAKER_13]: needs to be in opposition with this thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that now that we've noticed so
much diversity and divisiveness,
[SPEAKER_13]: not diversity as far as like diverse,
but being diverse and divisive and being
[SPEAKER_13]: separated, I think that we need to realize
that there's all these beautiful
[SPEAKER_13]: conversations that bring in a holistic
value.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to accept all the different values and
realize that they're all there because
[SPEAKER_13]: we're all invited.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our table.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're bringing everything and putting it
to the table.
[SPEAKER_20]: Perspectives.
[SPEAKER_20]: Perspectives would be the term more than
sides.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're all perspectives.
[SPEAKER_10]: This covers the all learn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Warm fuzzies.
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you Alice too to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love everyone's dialogue that they bring
to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so expansive in everyone's front.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has a very unique understanding
of their disciplines that they've been
[SPEAKER_06]: studying respectively.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the beauty of it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just soak it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we love it so much,
right?
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a growing community now.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a changing community for a long time.
[SPEAKER_20]: We sort of, you know, almost held the keys
to the gate and that those gates have been
[SPEAKER_20]: blown off and the community has expanded
and it's over here and over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's, it's, you know, it's been some
years of the cannabis core community
[SPEAKER_20]: getting used to, you know, okay,
well look, we want it to be included.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want it to be included.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want it to be included.
[SPEAKER_20]: Then all of a sudden they included us and
everyone started criticizing everything
[SPEAKER_20]: about how it, you know, which is natural.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, you're kind of trying to steer
this thing or feel that you're steering a
[SPEAKER_20]: thing, but I really do welcome the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_20]: I welcome so many people to cannabis and
how they are all finding, like we
[SPEAKER_20]: mentioned with Colton earlier,
like different pathways, different
[SPEAKER_20]: roadways, and more importantly,
sharing those ways with us so that we can
[SPEAKER_20]: see all the incredible beneficial ways
that you can use this plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's 50,000 commercial purposes
this plant can be used for.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's, you know, plexiglasses and
metals.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's, you know, essential amino acid
rich seed oils.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really quite something when you,
when you start to break it down,
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm certain if it was discovered tomorrow
for the first time in the history of
[SPEAKER_20]: mankind, it would be one of the greatest
discoveries ever made.
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you're welcoming everyone,
but I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_22]: Can't hear you now.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I can hear you guys here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it's me.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about to say.
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, now that you're welcoming everybody
in, just be aware.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of fucking sharks
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_22]: So watch out.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of sharp fucking teeth and
they bite and they take a lot of flesh.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, uh, be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are in the industry for
all the wrong reasons, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that most people I know are in it
for all the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the people that people are
listening to and paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't see, um, the asshole with all
the followers or all of the people getting
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a job in a sense, and we have a
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a journey we all follow,
which is just spreading the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_03]: education on how cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saved my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I love preaching about it and
talking about it every day, wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, have you done a bond
rip?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's important to just keep sharing
that knowledge and how it helps you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My battery's low.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's really, my bad.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it's, it's really, it's really
important to make sure that patients are
[SPEAKER_16]: protected and that, you know, uh,
because this whole industry is centered
[SPEAKER_16]: around the patient, the patients are
really the ones that need to be taken care
[SPEAKER_16]: of the most, almost, you know,
as much, if not more than the plant
[SPEAKER_16]: itself.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, you know, there are plenty of patients
out there who I'm sure are getting,
[SPEAKER_16]: taking, taking advantage because the
people that they're getting their medicine
[SPEAKER_16]: from basically have a monopoly on their
life because you know, say you go to one
[SPEAKER_16]: grower and it's the only, for one reason
or the other, it's the only cannabis that
[SPEAKER_16]: works for you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you're stuck going to that one,
one grower or that one company or wherever
[SPEAKER_16]: it is you're going to.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they can basically dictate however it
is they want to give you your medicine or
[SPEAKER_16]: whatever they want to do with their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: They will.
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of patients, you know,
right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, a lot of patients need to
have protections like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: to make sure that their medicine isn't
going to be, you know, tampered with,
[SPEAKER_16]: that it's going to be coming in
consistently, effectively and safely that
[SPEAKER_16]: we know everything that's going into this
medicine because that's the gap that we're
[SPEAKER_13]: having.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're having even you as a patient,
having direct contact with the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, you being able to have this,
this incredible relationship with the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant because nobody can make medicine for
you better than you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think anyone who's a cultivator,
anyone who understands this plant
[SPEAKER_13]: understands that anyone, you know,
and, and that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all this politics and all this,
this oppression on this plant that's
[SPEAKER_13]: getting in the way from us to be able to
have this direct good connection with the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I love it that you said that
Colton, because you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plant is here for the patient.
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, the plant's number one goal is
to heal humanity.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's what, that's what she wants
to do is, is to have that for direct
[SPEAKER_13]: connection with patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and it continues to get in the way in
these conversations that we're having that
[SPEAKER_13]: are very holistic in nature allows that
energy to go out so that the plant can,
[SPEAKER_13]: can make its way into regular society.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that everybody can have that direct
relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is why we created the peer
certification to ally and bring farms
[SPEAKER_05]: together for the betterment of humanity to
create safe medicine that's alive and
[SPEAKER_05]: living along with our own bodies and
biomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So patients can have direct contact with,
with cultivators and these medicine makers
[SPEAKER_05]: have been like having to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're creating medicine that survives
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're all adapting and adaptogenic
medicine, you know, for the masses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that you can get what you need.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's so many cultivators that want
nothing more than to be cultivating
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine directly for patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's their number one goal and focus.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they feel incredibly frustrated just
like you that they can't get it to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been, he's been, you know,
walking his talk forever, his whole adult
[SPEAKER_13]: life of patient access.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we get the plant to the people and
the people to the plant?
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is, this is what we're all trying
to break down those barriers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that all that red tape is just,
it's just strangling us as patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and we, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would love to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the things, one of the reasons
why we don't grow and somebody on this
[SPEAKER_08]: panel needs to get this done is that we,
we do want testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure that what,
what we're growing isn't full of of
[SPEAKER_08]: miracle grow here in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're Monsanto Haven, but we,
we need that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, we always depend on a cultivator
and a grower of, of, with a company,
[SPEAKER_08]: because at least we're getting tested
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Home testing is, is very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, but, but we need to know how many
cannabinoids Colton is getting in his
[SPEAKER_08]: body, how many flavonoids are not,
not really flavonoids, but terpenes and,
[SPEAKER_08]: and if there's any microbials and is there
mold in it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you, you trust me to grow his
medicine and it's going to get shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he, it's, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that we need to have those
types of small little entities that,
[SPEAKER_08]: that help the novice grower empower
themselves to grow their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And without that, without those little
home testing kits that we can test,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we, we get afraid that we're not
getting the right cannabinoids and hit
[SPEAKER_08]: into his system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's just, there's just so many
aspects of, of home grow and in commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: grow and, and everything and all the red
tape that just strangles us as patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just, it's disheartening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, we're all, I think it's the term is
we're all learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every state is learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every bill is different and they're all
reminiscent of some bill that they heard
[SPEAKER_06]: about once.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's, that's,
that becomes the problem, but it also
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes the path forward and how we shape
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and it's, you know, it's something
that is important to, to know is that
[SPEAKER_06]: someone like myself, that's in a regulated
state, I work really hard to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that I have induction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seals and things that keep this stuff
fresh, because I know how long it takes to
[SPEAKER_06]: even get to a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just bought that alone boggles my
mind because coming from the traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: sense, it was immediate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just, you didn't have these,
you never had these hurdles before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, you know, the responsibility is,
is massive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the testing, you know,
that that's super important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, you can't, you can't be
ingesting mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're create your, you're trying to solve
for one problem and creating a new one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just, you know, it's important
to have access to labs, even for yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, yeah, home growers should
have access to all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it just gives us better insight
as to what we're doing and how we can do
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it's, it would, you know,
it just helps us further along what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: actually after, which is better
understanding of the things that we just
[SPEAKER_06]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm going to chime in here.
[SPEAKER_22]: It requires due diligence right now in
Utah.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're trying to pull PTSD off of a
condition for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_22]: So as forward, as we are moving,
there are still people trying to pull
[SPEAKER_22]: things back.
[SPEAKER_22]: So remember eternal vigilance is the price
of Liberty, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_22]: and your brothers and sisters in Utah need
your help.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, find local organizations,
national organizations chime in,
[SPEAKER_22]: but you know, it's a new year,
but the struggle is the same,
[SPEAKER_22]: unfortunately, for some people.
[SPEAKER_22]: And what you were also talking about,
Wendy is, you know, growing cannabis can
[SPEAKER_22]: be easy, but growing medical grade
cannabis consistently is an art and it's a
[SPEAKER_22]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a thing that one of the things
when I was a buyer that I used to do is,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, a plant can tell you exactly if
you've grown it enough times, you can look
[SPEAKER_22]: at a plant and tell exactly what's going
on and really freak out the grower.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're like, how the hell did you get in
my grow room?
[SPEAKER_22]: But the plant tells you everything.
[SPEAKER_22]: So having educated people who can give you
good information around cannabis is always
[SPEAKER_22]: challenging because every grower I know
grows different.
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone I know, you know, everybody here
is nodding because, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_22]: thinks they know how to grow it or this
way, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's also challenging to educate people
how to grow properly when everybody grows
[SPEAKER_22]: in different ways and paths and
pathologies.
[SPEAKER_22]: So depending if it's hydroponics,
if it's indoor, if it's outdoors,
[SPEAKER_22]: you've got different functions and
different religions to each specific ones,
[SPEAKER_22]: depending on what you have and have access
to.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's also what you can afford,
what you have access to.
[SPEAKER_22]: And yes, there needs to be regional
players who could come in and educate or
[SPEAKER_22]: there be regional places where people
could go and learn how to grow and educate
[SPEAKER_22]: themselves like what positronics used to
do.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, they would propagate clones.
[SPEAKER_22]: There'd be mothers there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you could come in and then grow your
plant if you need to in a communal
[SPEAKER_22]: environment so you could learn and teach
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_22]: But of course, that was decades ago in
Amsterdam and a galaxy far, far away.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's still applicable today is
community growing so that you can learn
[SPEAKER_22]: proper techniques so you can arrive at the
techniques that will most benefit you so
[SPEAKER_22]: that Colton can get a better quality of
cannabis from you than you had previously.
[SPEAKER_22]: Green thumbs aren't natural.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I do not have a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that we are learning
is that we moved from Illinois to Colorado
[SPEAKER_08]: for access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the legislative system there was they
tried and tried and tried to pull it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then we moved back from Colorado to
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the ecosystem here is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you have Blue Dream in Colorado,
it's a different style than it is here in
[SPEAKER_08]: Illinois because there's different growing
techniques and situations.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very humid here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very dry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you have a Colorado grower to come
in and grow your medicine in Illinois,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're running into a lot of situations
that they don't understand because they've
[SPEAKER_08]: never grown in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have rich soil here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of moisture in our air.
[SPEAKER_08]: So every region is so different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So making sure that we have medicine
across the United States, anywhere Colton
[SPEAKER_08]: decides to go that is consistent has been
very, very difficult to find.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, no one has pulled the Ray Kroc model
where you get your same big big mac here
[SPEAKER_22]: as you get in St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's still always been a frustration.
[SPEAKER_22]: And our 21 years of providing genetics is,
you know, people want what we had last
[SPEAKER_22]: year or the year before they didn't keep
or maintain.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's also challenging because,
you know, people grow differently.
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, you can get a different
yield in the lower areas of the Bay Area
[SPEAKER_22]: than you can in certain other areas of the
Bay Area, because there's so many
[SPEAKER_22]: microclimates there's literally more
microclimates here in the Bay Area than
[SPEAKER_22]: some places in the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it becomes challenging just here in an
area in a region as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: It becomes challenging for consistency and
maintaining or getting consistent access
[SPEAKER_22]: from my patient's perspective is a
frustration because also having stability
[SPEAKER_22]: of access to the genetics so that when
somebody says this is a blue dream,
[SPEAKER_22]: it is actually a blue dream, but not
something else masquerading as a blue
[SPEAKER_22]: dream, which is, I think, one of the
bigger frustration a lot of us have found,
[SPEAKER_22]: especially having to forage in the
traditional market, much less even in the
[SPEAKER_22]: legal market, because consistency of
genetics to have the same big Mac every
[SPEAKER_22]: single day, I still can't do after 21
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that the only way that we can
actually help that progression along is
[SPEAKER_08]: interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if we can have you grow the same
exact medicine for Colton and be able to
[SPEAKER_08]: send it across the state lines,
then then we wouldn't have this issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one of the big things that we
will be pushing this year is interstate
[SPEAKER_08]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, like you said, there are so many
different regions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the way you grow may be
completely different.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way you grow blue dream may be
completely different than what's being the
[SPEAKER_08]: way you grow blue dream in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet the blue dream that you grow in
your area is what we like the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should definitely be pushing
interstate commerce and reciprocity and
[SPEAKER_08]: just making sure that it's available and
accessible across state lines and across
[SPEAKER_08]: country lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have a ton of people here in
Canada and we want to be able to access
[SPEAKER_08]: Canadians medicines, you know,
because we're the United States and our
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if you grow the best,
I want the best for my kid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to be able to access it without
having to move where you are.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I love the idea of expanding that.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to bring it across the world.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, globe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, imagine crying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go, Marcus, please.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just saying that it would be neat to
do that on a world scale, like have
[SPEAKER_20]: international commerce where, you know,
people who grow cannabis and extracts in
[SPEAKER_20]: different parts of the world all over
every country, being able to move those to
[SPEAKER_20]: different countries and to find certain
things and have discoveries as to,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, we speak about the importance of
terroir.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, if terroir is important,
then it's likely with cannabis that
[SPEAKER_20]: certain things will express themselves,
you know, more uniquely or whatever
[SPEAKER_20]: terminology you want to use.
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll see some unique expressions from
cannabis depending on where you grow it
[SPEAKER_20]: and at what time of year that you grow it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I love the idea of interstate travel
with for cannabis and being able to do
[SPEAKER_20]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I really love the idea of being able
to send stuff from like Colombia to,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, Illinois or to be for you guys
to be able to access stuff from everywhere
[SPEAKER_20]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would love to have things from Colombia
or Venezuela or wherever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just think of the ability to try
different areas and different regions of
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's more realistic now more than ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to be able to give you this nearly
clear rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to have your nearly clear rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: Michael Krawitz and the group down at the
UN changed international law over the
[SPEAKER_22]: holidays.
[SPEAKER_22]: They actually got cannabis pulled out of
schedule four.
[SPEAKER_22]: So actually medical marijuana now exists
in the fucking world for the first time.
[SPEAKER_22]: The DEA has still not responded to it in
December, but this now opens up things
[SPEAKER_22]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_22]: On top of that, hey, Georgia, we're
looking at you.
[SPEAKER_22]: If the state of Georgia passes and gets
both these Democrats elected, then you're
[SPEAKER_22]: going to see a more act and you will see
interstate commerce open up within the
[SPEAKER_22]: year here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_22]: But if it doesn't, then it's going to be
fought all the way through.
[SPEAKER_22]: But a lot of changes, a lot of places you
can plug in to make a lot of change
[SPEAKER_22]: happening not only internationally because
of medical marijuana now being
[SPEAKER_22]: internationally recognized by the UN and
the World Health Organization.
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to be able to import Canadian
cannabis and we want to be able to export
[SPEAKER_22]: our California cannabis as well so we can
have that genetics exchange, all that fun
[SPEAKER_22]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think 2021 and in the future,
a lot of stuff is opening up, but
[SPEAKER_22]: definitely interstate commerce
domestically could potentially happen
[SPEAKER_22]: soon.
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully we'll continue to push that
education forward and that conversation
[SPEAKER_13]: forward because just like you all are
looking for the right medicine,
[SPEAKER_13]: we as cultivators want nothing more than
to find the right patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when CBD is opened up and we are doing
our mycocana caps, I have direct contact
[SPEAKER_13]: with all of my patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm able to talk to them on a human level.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all freed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's direct.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's from the grower, the manufacturer,
the maker directly to the patients so we
[SPEAKER_13]: can have these conversations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in my garden, I could have,
okay, these three plants, I'm growing for
[SPEAKER_13]: Colton.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only am I growing them for the
varietal that he wants, but I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_13]: about him as I'm growing them and I'm
growing enough for him to have for an
[SPEAKER_13]: entire year that he's not going to run
out, that he's not continually looking for
[SPEAKER_13]: something.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to continue pushing that
conversation forward too, that the
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivators are having direct conversation
and communication and education with the
[SPEAKER_05]: patients worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to also say often
cannabis is fumigated when you bring it
[SPEAKER_05]: from another country, which completely
goes counterintuitive to everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: you've done to put into the medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's keep cannabis from being
fumigated and keep it medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's keep cannabis sacred and keep
cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we're fighting for this
international marketplace, let's be aware
[SPEAKER_05]: that a lot of herbs and foods get
fumigated with chemicals when they enter
[SPEAKER_05]: the shores of a new country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alice probably has something to say
about international.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Alice, it's nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on, girlfriend?
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice to see you all too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I said to Marcus, sorry I came in late,
but my cat dropped all my transplants,
[SPEAKER_15]: so I had to fix it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was actually wanting to bring up
something too because every time I come
[SPEAKER_15]: here, most of the people that are here are
either North Americans, right,
[SPEAKER_15]: are either from United States or from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love to come here and listen to all
the conversations.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I feel that you are all so many steps
ahead than we are in Brazil, even though I
[SPEAKER_15]: live in California now, that I just love
to come here, learn everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes I even take notes so I can just
rethink on how this could be a South
[SPEAKER_15]: American perspective.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a few things that you brought up today
that I really loved is this that you were
[SPEAKER_15]: talking about, the education and the fact
that the person that grows can also have a
[SPEAKER_15]: connection with the patient.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now in Brazil, they're trying to pass
a bill that only the government and
[SPEAKER_15]: importations would be ready to,
would be possible to produce cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: somehow or like deliver cannabis to
patients and no home growing at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: So no one can have the connection with the
medicine itself or grow from there for
[SPEAKER_15]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see how this is, how this just takes
the full on power autonomy of the patient.
[SPEAKER_15]: I talk like, I mean, I'm a cannabis
patient too, but I balance in between
[SPEAKER_15]: being a patient because of my chronic pain
and also being someone that uses like,
[SPEAKER_15]: that likes that, that likes high THC
content things, different terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_15]: and trying to balance that thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just so hard when we think of it
for someone from South America and a
[SPEAKER_15]: reality like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just love to come here and just
learn everything and try to, try to engage
[SPEAKER_15]: and translate this knowledge for the
people down there with the possibilities
[SPEAKER_15]: that are we know the possibilities that
are offered down there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much for all the,
for all the, I'm just listening today.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just like almost taking notes here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we're happy to have you Alice.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was kind of sad when I didn't see a few
key folks.
[SPEAKER_20]: Dr. Mark never made it today.
[SPEAKER_20]: We hope and wish him a happy new year and
that everything's okay with him.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause I know he had planned on making it,
but he had a birthday too.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that what?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_20]: Didn't he?
[SPEAKER_20]: He just had a birthday on earth strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: For Dr. Mark also lives in an area that
used to be the mushroom capital of the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want, I was hoping he would be in
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could talk a little bit about Kennet
square and see if that has any roots at
[SPEAKER_20]: large.
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll have to wait till next week,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I bring up one subject since I arrived
here late and I said, like, last,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's just that now I'm stoned and
tripping and I just something crossed my
[SPEAKER_15]: mind, which is how we were talking about
education and cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And we recognize cannabis as this moderate
plan and this very medicinal plant too.
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of people, and I think that all
of us are aware of that do not use the
[SPEAKER_15]: plant additionally.
[SPEAKER_15]: They create different patterns.
[SPEAKER_15]: They create different relationships with
the plant that sometimes there be there,
[SPEAKER_15]: their actions, their, their daily tests,
their behavior towards the plant does not
[SPEAKER_15]: create a healthy setting or a healthy
environment for the people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that I almost don't
hear about here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like in Brazil, when we're engaging
content about cannabis and things like
[SPEAKER_15]: this, we always try to bring up this
perspective too, which is almost harm
[SPEAKER_15]: reduction, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Coming with the good things and the bad
things and how to balance them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like to hear all from all of
you, something that it's hard for us to
[SPEAKER_15]: hear.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for you all to tell me
something negative about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And cause I think that that's a thing that
engages in the education, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: in balancing harms and risks.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to talk about this with you
all because two months ago we made a post
[SPEAKER_15]: on girls in green and a content based on
the net that we have to talk about the
[SPEAKER_15]: negative effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was the thing that most engaged
lately because that's something that you
[SPEAKER_15]: people were talking about.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to bring it up here for
a discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead, Wendy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was the dare mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we established that earlier,
but when it came to Colton being a patient
[SPEAKER_08]: of Crohn's and on pharmaceutical
medicines, I saw more harm on
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmaceuticals than I have on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to say that there isn't any type of
harm, but I haven't found any.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a mindset.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that because we have villainized
this plant for so long that people push
[SPEAKER_08]: off a lot of negativity towards a person
that does use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Facebook group, it's called
Parents Opposed to Pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just push the negativity so bad
when as a parent with a kid that was 13
[SPEAKER_08]: when he started using cannabis,
which I never thought in a million years
[SPEAKER_08]: that I would do, I just don't see a whole
lot of negative other than the mentality
[SPEAKER_08]: of other people that are against it still.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can educate everyone about the
benefits of it, I think that you would see
[SPEAKER_08]: less harm than using the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the negative stigma of it is
really what makes it worse.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that with everybody who has
tried cannabis, there hasn't really been
[SPEAKER_16]: anybody that had a bad effect from it as
far as somebody getting sick from it as in
[SPEAKER_16]: someone getting cancer.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not gonna get cancer or anything
from it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously there are some cannabinoids that
have some effects that you don't want to
[SPEAKER_16]: have.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I can't have THCV, it's an appetite
suppressant, I would lose a lot of weight,
[SPEAKER_16]: not good for someone with a wasting
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not to say that THCV is bad.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not bad, it's doing exactly what it's
designed to do, which is to suppress your
[SPEAKER_16]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are obviously some people that
should back off from that cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_16]: go to other cannabinoids instead.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think everybody can have a bad trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like Dragonfly was saying earlier,
you have to have good medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have all of these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have all of these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that with education and good
growing habits and less monopoly when it
[SPEAKER_08]: comes to these huge companies that wanna
just take over and make billions and
[SPEAKER_08]: billions of dollars, I think that that's
where we need to start is making sure that
[SPEAKER_08]: people are educated, understand that,
yeah, if you have a bad trip, it could
[SPEAKER_08]: have been because they're using Monsanto
pesticides in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that it wasn't just, it could have
just been a fluke that we have an
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid system and that we need to
nourish it and we need to keep it
[SPEAKER_08]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that it is all encompassing of
education.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to bring up one thing
that it's a different perspective to you
[SPEAKER_15]: Colin too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when you're in South America or in
Brazil, no one knows which cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're buying brick weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that I like to bring
up here because it's such a different
[SPEAKER_15]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I asked about the negative effects of
cannabis, it's the negative effects of
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis and prohibition is itself too.
[SPEAKER_15]: That in a non-legalized setting,
we have all these other layers that
[SPEAKER_15]: doesn't have a market.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no testings at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: You brought the testing so much today,
how it is important for a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_15]: And over there, people medicate themselves
with whatever weed they can find because
[SPEAKER_15]: they recognize weed as something
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are doing a can of butter out of
brick weed with a lot of like chemicals on
[SPEAKER_15]: it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're giving the cookies to their,
trying to give the cookies to their
[SPEAKER_15]: grandma.
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes it's not exactly positive
for them.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe in you with the education,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that it's the tool for, so people can
balance if it's good or bad for them.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would add that, and I wouldn't say it's
necessarily bad, but I would say that for
[SPEAKER_20]: certain mental health afflictions here in
North America, at least, I've seen
[SPEAKER_20]: cannabis not be helpful.
[SPEAKER_20]: And what I mean by that is like how we
even deal with mental health in the first
[SPEAKER_20]: place and how it's so just swept under the
rug and no one, it's fine if you have a
[SPEAKER_20]: big tumor growing on your neck,
people will feel bad for you and they'll
[SPEAKER_20]: care for you.
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you have something twisting in your
mind that you're having difficulties with,
[SPEAKER_20]: people don't really have as much patience
for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: They get scared for their own wellbeing
with certain mental health afflictions.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really, that is the major problem
that we're not, this missing psychedelic
[SPEAKER_20]: component for taking care of people.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it was, it was one of the guys
that Dragonfly Earth Medicine had on who I
[SPEAKER_20]: guess he takes people through psychedelic
journeys.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_20]: He was talking about the importance of
bringing people back to their moments of
[SPEAKER_20]: trauma, holding them in your arms while
they're in that moment of whatever their
[SPEAKER_20]: trauma is.
[SPEAKER_20]: You could be a little baby that was
getting left in the room because some book
[SPEAKER_20]: said it was a good idea to make your baby
sleep away from you for the first night of
[SPEAKER_20]: its life.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, what a crazy, crazy thing to
convince mothers of.
[SPEAKER_20]: But it happens.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, there's all of these different
things with mental health that we've got
[SPEAKER_20]: these major problems.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think if we can take care of that
with the missing component that is
[SPEAKER_20]: psychedelic plant medicines and fungi,
that we'll see maybe less of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I have seen some people who have used
cannabis almost in an addictive way,
[SPEAKER_20]: smoking it like crazy amounts throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_20]: And just, and you can see that it wasn't
being helpful.
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a roommate who actually had to stop
eventually because it was really just,
[SPEAKER_20]: it was too much for him, especially the
way he was using it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I felt that from that relationship,
I've learned that because I use it in
[SPEAKER_20]: such, I am an anomaly to a lot of people
in the amounts that I use it, maybe not to
[SPEAKER_20]: you people here on this particular panel,
but to a lot of people, they'll get
[SPEAKER_20]: together with me and I'll always say,
listen, you don't have to keep up.
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't a keeping up thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want you to feel that every time I
have a little dab, that you also should
[SPEAKER_20]: have a little dab.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that relationship with my old roommate
really taught me that, that be aware that
[SPEAKER_20]: everyone's going through different things
and that everyone has different
[SPEAKER_20]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what I would say about that,
Alice.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will speak on two, one, I will speak
directly to what you spoke toward Marcus
[SPEAKER_22]: because there is studies that have shown
that people who do have multiple
[SPEAKER_22]: personality disorders or schizophrenia,
it does allow using some cannabis allows
[SPEAKER_22]: them to slip more lucidly in between their
personalities.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've seen VA studies regarding this
specific and a newer, more interesting one
[SPEAKER_22]: that is somewhat controversial,
which is cannabinoid hyper remesis
[SPEAKER_22]: syndrome, which causes chronic nausea.
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a friend of mine a daughter,
she was 16 and using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_22]: she got there on the islands in Hawaii and
just became chronically nauseous.
[SPEAKER_22]: Every time she became, she smoked cannabis
to the point where she had to go to the
[SPEAKER_22]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_22]: So people are finding that when a small
percentage of the community are finding
[SPEAKER_22]: that, you know, cannabis does not work for
them.
[SPEAKER_22]: Some people are allergic and this most
recent one, I would ask Dr. Drayson,
[SPEAKER_22]: are you familiar with the cannabinoid
hyper remesis syndrome?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems at least in some of the patients
that I work with, it seems to be THC that
[SPEAKER_10]: causes it more so than CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so some of our oncology patients will
switch them when they have these kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: type of reactions to cannabis,
we will switch them to like a CBD and they
[SPEAKER_10]: don't seem to have the same kind of like
nausea, physical pain that the hypermesis
[SPEAKER_10]: seems to bring with high THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also read a study that it had a lot,
some of it could have had to do with neem
[SPEAKER_08]: oil and I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard that theory come up.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've heard that theory too, but no
confirmation just to science to back that
[SPEAKER_22]: up.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all hearsay and conjecture at this
time.
[SPEAKER_22]: If there is a study that backs it up,
I'll be happy to cite it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alice, you had- Well, I've been doing a
bunch of study, you know, research and
[SPEAKER_13]: looking up on hypermesis syndrome and what
we're also finding is that it's sort of
[SPEAKER_13]: becoming an overlay, maybe like a
whitewash, if you will, sort of like
[SPEAKER_13]: fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you come in with pain and
doctors are really, they need to have the
[SPEAKER_13]: diagnosis it's part of the medical
industry to give you a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have to give you something.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hypermesis syndrome has been coming up
a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll ask people, do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_13]: They're having a lot of puking.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also finding that within those
people, if we ask further questions,
[SPEAKER_13]: can you please test the enzymes of the
stool and of the blood for gallbladder?
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of these people are having
gallbladder issues simultaneously and is
[SPEAKER_13]: the endocannabinoid system sparking
something?
[SPEAKER_13]: Also THCA isn't seemingly reacting in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I just wanted to further
what you're saying, Allison.
[SPEAKER_13]: THCS has been very active with whatever
this syndrome or reaction is.
[SPEAKER_13]: THCA has not been so much like CBD also.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of information out there
that we just don't know enough about as
[SPEAKER_13]: well as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I know Colin, you would probably
have a lot to say about this.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's people who are reacting directly
to terpene consumption.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we, you know, grow plants that
are very, very low in terpenes,
[SPEAKER_13]: those people who have these symptoms and
symptomatic effects from certain high
[SPEAKER_13]: aromatics of cultivars, when we reduce
those aromatics, they do much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of there's also anecdotal
evidence that we've seen in family that
[SPEAKER_05]: have had hypermesis really bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll smoke it and come back from a
weekend of smoking other herb that's
[SPEAKER_05]: wherever at an event and then have some of
our herb that we grew and not have any
[SPEAKER_05]: effects of it at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely common to find cannabis
with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the harms with cannabis might be
that it's a dynamic accumulator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the harms is it uptakes bad
attitudes and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those bad attitudes and chemicals
react in our body.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also wisdom weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes it brings out the ailments
that we need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes if you smoke weed and you get
an adverse ailment, it might be a window
[SPEAKER_05]: towards something else that might be
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so also one other thing is another
harm to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of us would be maybe to say that it's
the one thing that can heal you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing that's harmful is it's not
the only thing that can heal you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the things that you use along
with health, well-being, exercise,
[SPEAKER_05]: community, connectivity, diversity,
and love.
Food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food, juicing.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those things are definitely,
yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things are definitely something that
we learn coming into, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're newbies at cannabis still.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we've been involved in this
situation for seven years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colton decided now to not just have
Crohn's disease, but have massive migraine
[SPEAKER_08]: headaches and cannabis isn't touching
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is all encompassing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your whole well-being It is music.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is love.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is conventional medicines.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just have to find what that is and
enjoy it and be in the moment with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an all or nothing system.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there are people that use,
you know, cannabis alongside their
[SPEAKER_16]: pharmaceutical regimens and they're having
great success with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really, it's always about what you
as an individual need for your body.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's never about, you know, oh,
well, everybody is doing this,
[SPEAKER_16]: so I'll do it that way too.
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though, you know, a lot of people may
be taking the same medicine that you are.
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't mean that you have to be taking
it the same way or you have to be taking
[SPEAKER_16]: the same amount.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, your body requires different
things.
[SPEAKER_16]: So don't be afraid of only using one thing
to meet those qualifications.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or using multiple things to meet those
qualifications because that's the journey
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're going to be heading on with his
migraines is trying to find, to see if
[SPEAKER_08]: psilocybin would be beneficial for
Colton's migraines.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's obviously not the perfect solution
for his body when it comes to his
[SPEAKER_08]: migraines, but it is a great solution for
his Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think using everything in your
arsenal and in the world that you can get
[SPEAKER_08]: your hands on is definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_15]: And with no stigma, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: No stigmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: No stigmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a really big thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It changes the experience that the person
is going to have.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if you're in a prohibitionist
setting, there is a way more of a
[SPEAKER_15]: possibility that if you take a
psychedelic, you're going to go into a
[SPEAKER_15]: difficult trip.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have to be a bad trip,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: But a difficult time because you're going
to, you're going to go through that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's prohibited.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, my mom doesn't know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm taking something that no one knows.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what the fuck this is because
I don't know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, you know, so there's a lot of
things that connect to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's definitely your mental,
you know, that's your mental capacity and
[SPEAKER_08]: your mental state is definitely something
that, that would react to negatively
[SPEAKER_08]: towards your, your trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: If, if you were in like, oh my gosh,
you know, am I going to get caught?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's one of the reasons why we
thought, okay, moving to Colorado where
[SPEAKER_08]: we're safe, where we have access,
where mentally we're relaxed, that it's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to make his, his opportunity to,
for health better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think mental stigma is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Most dangerous thing about cannabis is
getting caught with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's one thing that Marca shared
about like mental health that,
[SPEAKER_15]: well, I graduated in psychology before I
changed my life for the, to grow weed,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I, some, some two subjects that I see
cannabis as a tool to help out,
[SPEAKER_15]: but also if it's used improperly as a tool
to make you go deeper, even deeper in the
[SPEAKER_15]: hole is anxiety and depression too.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it all depends on what, what you were
all saying, especially Dan Pure that
[SPEAKER_15]: brings this holistic experience that it's
not only the cannabis itself, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's everything that comes with it,
all your daily habits and things like
[SPEAKER_15]: this.
[SPEAKER_15]: But with people that have like a severe
anxiety consuming high THC higher THC
[SPEAKER_15]: profiles can help them, can even be a
factor that helped them like have one more
[SPEAKER_15]: of an anxiety crisis, but different
cannabinoids with different ways of
[SPEAKER_15]: consuming it can help out settle down and
to calm down too.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very crazy that just the knowledge
and the education towards the plant can
[SPEAKER_15]: change the whole experience you can get
with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to shine a light on this
too, because mental illness and,
[SPEAKER_15]: and every, every, every medicine it
doesn't, it doesn't matter if it's
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis or if it's an antidepressive
medicine, it's like a, from the
[SPEAKER_15]: traditional, you know, like, sorry,
my English is kind of, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of sucks sometimes, but from,
from like this medical traditional medical
[SPEAKER_15]: environment, every person it's subjective
and every person is going to create an
[SPEAKER_15]: experience towards that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So with cannabis is the same thing and it
has to be taken care of and seen and taken
[SPEAKER_15]: care of by a community, not only by a
cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: By a psychiatrist, not only by a doctor
that only sees the symptom.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that cannabis at this point,
I wanted to bring up the subject about the
[SPEAKER_15]: good and the bad parts of cannabis,
because I think that that creates a
[SPEAKER_15]: setting while someone has the autonomy to
balance everything and make a choice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in Colorado, so I can make these
choices.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or I'm in Brazil, so I can make exactly
the choices I wanted, but I have to go
[SPEAKER_15]: with the flow of what I have here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to bring this up and
bring this, bring the subject up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to- I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great one, Alice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen two potential problems,
if you will, with using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has a really strong biphasic
effect where you get certain effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience at low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you increase the dose,
particularly if you, and you use the
[SPEAKER_00]: example of somebody who takes brick weed
and makes cookies and gives it to their
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother, and grandmother gets like 150
milligrams of THC, and she never wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's lost the opportunity to
experience some of the healing effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis can offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about education, which has come
up a number of times today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other place that I've seen cannabis
potentially be a problem is at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: dose and the right chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has really remarkable properties
to relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pain is actually a message from your
body to stop doing what's causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know from personal experience that
you can use cannabis to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's an education thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping people understand how
cannabis interacts with our
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and how it can help
our bodies not just heal trauma from
[SPEAKER_00]: injury or overuse, but really help our
bodies find the condition we call wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: or health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited about something
I've been doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to throw this in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've created an education program for a
local dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that program is to help the
consumer who doesn't know much at all
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis other than, well,
if you smoke a joint, you get high,
[SPEAKER_00]: help a consumer to understand how cannabis
wellness might work in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a part of the other part of the
program is for the wellness associates,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are doing the transactions
in the dispensary, helping them to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what does cannabis as a
wellness product, not just as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a wellness product is helping
people find this wholeness that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have that and mental health,
particularly with the COVID and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people being forced into isolation,
mental health, I think is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the conversation today has
been really fruitful in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to more people having
access to the educational thing that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been putting together because I'm really
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've realized I'm trying to address a
perceived need where people don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what we talk about when we
speak of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As medicine and I wanted to touch on one
other thing that was said earlier in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about isolates and
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of the cannabinoids,
but really when, because we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about patients and patient wellbeing,
every person's ECS is different and every
[SPEAKER_00]: person responds differently to cannabis
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important for opportunity
to be available to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: For seeds to get out to as many people as
possible and let them start trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that's going to work for them
because this plant will assert itself
[SPEAKER_00]: herself in knowing you and providing the
medicine, the chemistry that is again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, Blue Dream,
pardon my rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm taking up a lot of time right
at the end of the show, but I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream does really well in certain
parts of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine in Illinois where the
environmental conditions are very
[SPEAKER_00]: different, the genetics of that plant
would give you a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, analytical testing is really an
essential thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, happy new year,
everyone, and much love and much respect
[SPEAKER_00]: to each of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll stop ranting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't think of that as a rant at all,
but it was a great way to kind of end out
[SPEAKER_20]: the show.
[SPEAKER_20]: So to polish it off, my little son is
anxious for me to go spend the afternoon
[SPEAKER_20]: with him.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm actually very anxious to go spend
the afternoon with him.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you are into it, we can continue this
next Sunday and have more discussions
[SPEAKER_20]: about everything that we just talked
about.
[SPEAKER_20]: I am going to figure out a kind of behind
the scenes separate show for the mushroom,
[SPEAKER_20]: the traversing the fungal turpentine.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to start with the turpanome,
as Josh hooked us up with earlier.
[SPEAKER_20]: That'll be the new mushroom show,
the first of its kind on Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_20]: World.
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that, Alice?
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, I want to come, I want to come,
because I started the mushroom too,
[SPEAKER_15]: because of anxiety and things like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: I started the microdosing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I've been feeling very great with
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been very good.
[SPEAKER_15]: And always the dampier cocoa too,
together with the microdose.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's been great.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can talk of it as a psychedelic,
how do you say it?
[SPEAKER_15]: The person that goes through the
experience, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like not the girl, not the cultivator,
but someone that has been going through.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_20]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, listen, I'll let you guys all say
goodbye.
[SPEAKER_20]: I will invite you all back next week so we
can continue this conversation.
[SPEAKER_20]: And for sure, I want to invite Mark back
next week, because we didn't talk about
[SPEAKER_20]: the hash church cultivar.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're like just kind of easing into it
slow.
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're going to come back next week.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to start with that and talk
about that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_20]: You can give us the breakdown on how it
came to be and its parental stock and all
[SPEAKER_20]: of that goodness.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll share some macro photographs and some
information in regards to working with it,
[SPEAKER_20]: pressing rods and sifting it, bubbling it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely want to talk with you more,
Dr. Allison.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was great to reconnect with you and
everyone, all of you.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was amazing to spend 2021, January 3rd,
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_20]: With all of you.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was wonderful.
