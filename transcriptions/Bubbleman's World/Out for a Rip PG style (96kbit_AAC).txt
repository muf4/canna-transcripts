[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wanna go out for a rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going for a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Powerline bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking A-Rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He snapped the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were telling us that you just
caught a golden eagle on your fishing rod.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from the great white north,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like up above the states?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big landmass that the rest of the
world hates?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like above that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking north, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big patch of trees where everybody's
bored to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just chilling up here, sipping
syrup, playing hockey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we learn to walk, we can cross
check properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rocking plaid jackets, chainsaws,
we operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A-Rice we do, bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We caught our way in firewood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every 20 minutes or so, smoke break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the Leafs make the playoffs,
I'll fucking jump in the lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Buddy comes over to my place the
other night, and he's like, you wanna go
[SPEAKER_02]: out for a rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fucking right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from the land of the polite,
where shit's covered in ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm down in the states,
they're like, you're too fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, we got manners,
but fucking Buddy's still fighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking swear, and fucking drink all
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this one time, me and fucking Buddy
are out having a dart, and fucking Buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: burns a hole in my coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck, bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the coat was pretty new,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put his head in a snowbank,
and just started fucking feeding him the
[SPEAKER_02]: right left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fucking boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had enough yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, OK, OK, fuck, chill out,
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pulled him out of the snow,
and we went out for a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over a rip, are you fucking right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be in the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It never gets old just coming down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanna go out for a rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright time for a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking A right boy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taking a little dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: D420K no joke that is dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out for a rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've smoked it a couple of times now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the two chains trippy stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pimps back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so it's right on the element.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to like lift up the milk
piece to fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The halibut is right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for anyone over 40 once again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Key ingredient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was dropping my hash into the top when
it didn't break right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to drop your hash in and I was
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a black one home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dripping it down and I'm wondering
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it even going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice attachment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what he calls trippy stick 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original trippy stick broke away from
the battery and this was one piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to lift this off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine doesn't even come out anymore and
then drop the hash in through there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was easy but when you needed to
clean it or do any type of work it became
[SPEAKER_04]: a little more difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he really made it a better product by
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trippy salute to Emilio for making a great
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Us rednecks here in northern BC are
digging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like flawless machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flawless machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the ACDC version?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from the great white north right like
up above the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big land mass that the rest of the
world hates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like above that fucking north I
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big patch of trees where everybody's
bored to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just chilling up here sipping syrup
playing hockey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we learn to walk we can cross check
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rocking plaid jackets chainsaws we
operate them right.

other night and he's like you wanna go for
