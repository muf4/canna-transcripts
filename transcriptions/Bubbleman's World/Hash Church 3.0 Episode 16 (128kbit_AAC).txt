[SPEAKER_12]: fontaine how are you guys doing this
morning groovy and good not the same
[SPEAKER_12]: groovy and good excellent excellent well
we got a small group in here today but i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: sure eventually we'll end up with uh with
a few more peeps i never know if the email
[SPEAKER_12]: send properly or if the you know sometimes
i think i've sent out invitations to
[SPEAKER_12]: people and they haven't actually been sent
out so i'll just in case go back to my
[SPEAKER_12]: microsoft uh micro uh sorry not micro
outlook yeah well i guess it's microsoft
[SPEAKER_12]: outlook and make sure that i resend that
email so that uh everyone is indeed gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be here so i'm pretty excited for a couple
of reasons today one we're supposed to get
[SPEAKER_03]: our emerald cup samples today so i'm
judging cartridges so i'm really excited
[SPEAKER_03]: to uh see everything and what's there this
year and the other reason i'm excited is
[SPEAKER_03]: uh my my uh business as well as cannabis
was deemed uh not only essential it was
[SPEAKER_03]: put up to the top of the list for covet 19
and uh so i just called kaiser and friday
[SPEAKER_03]: i was able to go down and get my first
vaccine shot from Pfizer for uh covet 19
[SPEAKER_03]: so i was pretty uh stoked and excited and
more than excited for my people and anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis industry especially
dispensaries frontline workers can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually go get your vaccines now so uh
you can actually actually call and make it
[SPEAKER_03]: happen so call your provider mindless
kaiser you can call blue cross whoever and
[SPEAKER_03]: you didn't you don't have to show your id
card you don't have to pay for anything
[SPEAKER_03]: all you do is show up fill out your card
fill out the form and they get you in set
[SPEAKER_03]: up your appointment for three weeks from
now give you your shot you sit for 15
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes see if you have any side effects
and then they send you on your way so i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty excited i got my first vaccination
shot and my people can get more protection
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh yeah that we get the actual emerald
cup samples today was uh will be exciting
[SPEAKER_03]: to say the least i'm not excited about
football super bowl sunday but i am about
[SPEAKER_03]: judging my cannabis sunday so that's more
exciting for me needless to say so how
[SPEAKER_12]: about you wait say again marcus i was just
wondering today is the super bowl uh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: rumor control that yeah that today is or
as i call it a good commercial day so uh
[SPEAKER_12]: why don't we all pack super bowl well
there you go i like that it's a great idea
[SPEAKER_12]: marcus i'm not sure why the new chat is
not working i haven't seen a single oh
[SPEAKER_12]: apparently i have to comment first comment
first there we go isn't that funny if i
[SPEAKER_12]: don't comment first the chat doesn't open
up for the rest really that's so funny
[SPEAKER_00]: well i have a question for you is that a
uh uh is that a statewide mandate for uh
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis workers or is that something
that's happening just in the county yes
[SPEAKER_03]: one of my uh one of my veterans action
council uh brian buckley with the uh
[SPEAKER_03]: helman valley grows association he told me
last week that he showed up to do that uh
[SPEAKER_03]: and to get a shot and and when he did they
were like you're too young and he said
[SPEAKER_03]: well i'm an essential worker uh in the
cannabis industry and they checked with
[SPEAKER_03]: their supervisor and they said yes and so
they actually put out a breakdown so um i
[SPEAKER_03]: then got that breakdown uh sent it to my
uh of governor affairs person sabrina
[SPEAKER_03]: fendrick who is on the board of the uh
ucba the united cannabis business
[SPEAKER_03]: association she then uh they then
contacted the state and then the state
[SPEAKER_03]: gave authorization as of friday morning so
there is an actual uh full-on mandate i
[SPEAKER_03]: actually published on my facebook i put
published it in uh the california city and
[SPEAKER_03]: county watch as well and the east bay so
uh there's a full breakdown we're
[SPEAKER_03]: considered uh 1a1b and all you have to do
is make your phone call if and they ask if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're emergency you are you say yes and
then they make your appointment and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can go down and get your first of your two
shots thank you excellent news well i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: glad you're all shot up and you look
healthy you don't look sick so no adverse
[SPEAKER_03]: reactions for you no extra arms no extra
appendages no weird feelings nothing uh
[SPEAKER_03]: the shot was you know she did the old one
two three you know right into the arm it
[SPEAKER_03]: was quick and painless you know it was
just a little sore like right around you
[SPEAKER_03]: know where you usually get a shot but i
sat down for the 15 minutes had no adverse
[SPEAKER_03]: reactions and i was allowed to go home and
i came home and ate because i was so
[SPEAKER_03]: nervous i i didn't eat much beforehand and
then when i got home i was just ravenous
[SPEAKER_03]: so uh yeah it was uh yeah just a good
feeling and then this the night sleep was
[SPEAKER_03]: fine woke up yesterday no soreness in the
arm and um yeah as stated i'm just excited
[SPEAKER_03]: to get my people protected and that were
deemed essential and if we're deemed
[SPEAKER_03]: essential this high up in the state we
need to definitely capitalize this on the
[SPEAKER_03]: national and the state level for sure
because um that you know we've never been
[SPEAKER_03]: this high or considered in society before
so this gives us a platform to stand upon
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh kind of a you know a unique
position we've never had before so we have
[SPEAKER_03]: to figure out how to properly capitalize
on that we had of course uh schumer come
[SPEAKER_03]: out this week and say here in the united
states they want to pass some sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis decriminalization reform uh this
year which is rather surprising because a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the brain think we're thinking
closer to uh two years from now and to
[SPEAKER_03]: think that they actually want to get
something through is one concerning
[SPEAKER_03]: because they rushed through the more act
and then they added all kinds of things
[SPEAKER_03]: including removing of social equity which
is a huge problem because you know felons
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans and those and you know people of
color across the board that have been hurt
[SPEAKER_03]: by this drug war especially those that
have been arrested should have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry because they're also some of
the most experienced you know people in
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry uh if they know the risks
took the risks and you know everybody who
[SPEAKER_03]: takes the risks is possible to threaten it
100 percent of the time there's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be things that happen so you know they
shouldn't be penalized or hurt from that
[SPEAKER_03]: in canada do you have any such disbarment
for uh felons into the industry johnny
[SPEAKER_13]: marcus sorry i'm like super stoned right
now i was like does your country bar
[SPEAKER_03]: people who have previous felonies in
cannabis yes being in the industry that's
[SPEAKER_12]: why i'm not in the industry oh really
because i am in the industry and i have
[SPEAKER_12]: previous felonies so i have a very
different answer from john people with
[SPEAKER_12]: felonies can get into the industry if you
try so depending on being honest charges
[SPEAKER_13]: and your felony charges so if you really
want to get into it depending on where you
[SPEAKER_13]: lie where you are in an industry and what
you've done so if you have exactly if you
[SPEAKER_12]: if you have felony cannabis charges if you
have felony cannabis charges you're okay
[SPEAKER_12]: if you've robbed a bank you are not so
okay johnny's got the bank charges i don't
[SPEAKER_13]: go ahead really clarification
clarification um i have a i have a charge
[SPEAKER_13]: in this flight i'm a stupid little thing
that is now dealt with actually it was uh
[SPEAKER_13]: i'm not going to get into it here on
hashtag so it's funny it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_12]: what you think it's totally johnny berth
fellow and it's totally innocent but yes
[SPEAKER_12]: he did end up seemingly with uh with a
fairly serious thing on his jacket don't
[SPEAKER_03]: do that in the future just all i'm saying
yeah uh johnny's packing up a super bowl i
[SPEAKER_12]: think uh the rest i am probably also it's
super bowl sunday with with johnny b i am
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely loading up it's uh one of those
days where actually i was just talking
[SPEAKER_13]: with some other people this morning and
they actually have it all set up like it
[SPEAKER_13]: is like super bowl sunday they're partying
doing the same thing they're treating it
[SPEAKER_13]: like a super bowl sunday uh but it's just
the family it's everybody in the living
[SPEAKER_13]: room and everybody's setting up all the
treats and stuff like that so you know a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of people are just having a great day
today and just living it up and you know
[SPEAKER_13]: edge and everybody's got i'm doing the
first bounce you know the goodness yep got
[SPEAKER_02]: to show off what you got i'm doing some
oakland extracts garlotto uh some mango
[SPEAKER_13]: and how about clubhouse wow that place is
so addicting it's ridiculous it's fun i
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy it i've uh i've been listening and
learning more than anything it's fun to
[SPEAKER_03]: get pulled up to speak on things but yeah
i've been listening to all of us so week
[SPEAKER_03]: on uh on clubhouse colin dropping
knowledge marcus definitely doctor over
[SPEAKER_03]: here dr mark dropping all kinds of fucking
knowledge telling people shut up i'm not
[SPEAKER_13]: done talking yet yeah yeah and colin dude
what's up mad respect you just like so
[SPEAKER_13]: dropping the knowledge and and everything
that you've done and what you're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything it's uh thank you you know it's
funny i uh i take you know i take marcus
[SPEAKER_01]: as a friend very seriously and and i love
i love you marcus very much and i i think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of things that are being
said on that platform that we we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate but we need to there needs to be
truth to a lot of this stuff and i think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's um it's important that we share the
truth that we've been taught and and just
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to be truthful to the individuals
and the the other people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in this plant and and also
learn from the other individuals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: on the platform that we've never
interacted with before there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that i probably would never speak
to in any other instance um and it brings
[SPEAKER_01]: us all together so it's really special in
that respect um and johnny thanks thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: for saying those kind words that you know
i'm just trying to just trying to do my
[SPEAKER_12]: part you know teach what i was talking i
really enjoyed it i found that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: until a particular person ended up on
there and just i could i suddenly started
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at clubhouse like oh i want to go
in that room that person's in there right
[SPEAKER_12]: now i would be in the room and that person
would come in and i'd be like oh i gotta
[SPEAKER_12]: just like the absolute bullshit that was
coming out of this guy's mouth and the
[SPEAKER_12]: just the plate just the slander just the
full-blown slander i personally chose to
[SPEAKER_12]: avoid it colin chose to take it on head on
and literally you know go to war uh with
[SPEAKER_12]: this guy and and crush them really i
wasn't in the room at the time because i
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't want to be and i won't even mention
his name because he doesn't even deserve
[SPEAKER_12]: the exposure here on half church but uh
what i would explain uh express to people
[SPEAKER_12]: that are using um clubhouse and enjoying
it you know as far as i know i don't think
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a block feature so when you go
into a room is there is a block feature
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah i have blocked into a room with a
blocked person does that mean you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: hear them uh i have not gone into a
blocked room to listen to that person so
[SPEAKER_03]: uh i have yet to actually do that but i
get pinged all the time for this person
[SPEAKER_03]: who i consider one of the most unethical
people in our industry and uh for some
[SPEAKER_03]: reason people ping me and i had to write
them on the side and say look don't call
[SPEAKER_03]: me into a room with this person because uh
and here's why you know because i will not
[SPEAKER_03]: be kind um and we have to be in there we
have to be talking to people because these
[SPEAKER_03]: people are dropping all kinds of
misinformation lies half truths and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know they're trying to name dropping so
bad that it's just absolutely obnoxious to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point where you know sure the novice
definitely gets intrigued by it but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really fucking annoying to those that have
been in the movement and watch these
[SPEAKER_03]: people use and manipulate people and now
you know try to win them over you know you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't you can't go out you uh you know
make yourself look bad by saying these you
[SPEAKER_03]: know negative things but it's definitely
uh something that we have to watch for uh
[SPEAKER_03]: especially those that especially that
overtaker room and won't let anyone else
[SPEAKER_03]: talk uh those those are obnoxious as hell
oh and let our discord people know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have access to discord hash hash to hash
church people if you have extra invites
[SPEAKER_03]: for uh your clubhouse there's people in
that discord looking for invites so that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can come and listen to you all during
the week so people are looking for invites
[SPEAKER_12]: still to access clubhouse because it's
still five or six and i've offered uh for
[SPEAKER_12]: anyone to send me an email bc bubble man
at iCloud if you give me your full name
[SPEAKER_12]: and your phone number i'll add you to my
contacts which is how you send an invite
[SPEAKER_12]: out for clubhouse and um yeah the only
thing i would ask is that the two invites
[SPEAKER_12]: that you get um that you use for other
people from the hash church group so i'll
[SPEAKER_12]: forward you a couple of people's numbers
if people aren't comfortable sharing their
[SPEAKER_12]: names and numbers that's fine too dirty
thinks it's uh dirty uh what's his name 42
[SPEAKER_12]: dot star no fourth thinks that it's all
the cia but i mean at that point isn't
[SPEAKER_12]: youtube all the cia isn't samsung your
smartphone isn't everyone the cia like
[SPEAKER_12]: aren't you just completely being listened
to at all times through your plants and
[SPEAKER_12]: birds aren't real and the earth is flat
covid 19 is fake and i can't even keep up
[SPEAKER_03]: with all of it really but um your phone
tracks you absolutely everywhere and
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere you go and what you know so yeah
for me it's a great tool it's just like
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else it can be abused but it can
be used and if anything what has it done
[SPEAKER_03]: oh we've all been together multiple times
this week on a social media platform
[SPEAKER_03]: talking and discussing and you know
listening and learning oh that's so
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible how cruel and evil you you
information shares you how dare you
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors and dr mark man dropping the
knowledge on the chemistry side just so
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome i uh i really appreciate i mean
from zero to absolute confused and just a
[SPEAKER_01]: snap of a finger i love it it's good it's
just so such a good i don't know i like
[SPEAKER_12]: the conversation mark we've done like 15
hours this week on clubhouse we were doing
[SPEAKER_12]: like four hour after work i would started
at three and ended around seven or eight o
[SPEAKER_12]: 'clock and we did that at least three
times last week i did 15 hours a day i
[SPEAKER_13]: think for a few days in a row i was from
one room to another jumping on people just
[SPEAKER_13]: who were just talking about the randomness
things in the world not even some of them
[SPEAKER_13]: are cannabis related i'm just like hey
let's check out this room it's pretty cool
[SPEAKER_13]: it really is if you if you just want to
soak in some knowledge oh it's awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i've been in like six or seven rooms
with you alone johnny b oh yeah i'm i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: i'm calling marcy i see i see all of you
guys in all these rooms and i'm like oh
[SPEAKER_13]: okay it's like going to a trade show right
now and and it's like going to like i used
[SPEAKER_13]: to go to all these shows they have all
these different rooms and you just walk by
[SPEAKER_13]: hey dude you go to the next he's going to
hear that next person talk i wish i'm club
[SPEAKER_13]: host they had to schedule speakers at
certain times that we do have certain
[SPEAKER_13]: meetings and i know it goes all over the
place that's the whole thing it's like you
[SPEAKER_13]: go into one topic it's not even on that
topic you just got to click on to see what
[SPEAKER_13]: the hell they're talking about because you
have no idea what they're really talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about the headline might say something but
believe me it's completely different 15
[SPEAKER_13]: minutes after that headline is being it's
it's awesome that way so i had a great
[SPEAKER_12]: conversation with some jamaicans the other
day on bob marley's earth strong february
[SPEAKER_12]: 6th that was yesterday i invited wade in i
thought it was a trip these guys were
[SPEAKER_12]: getting into it like clubhouse style
instead of blowing smoke up the up the
[SPEAKER_12]: marley foundation but they were
celebrating bob but at the same time they
[SPEAKER_12]: were like you know bob did this and bob
did that and he didn't do this and he kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of fucked this guy over and you know the
the marley foundation wanted to create
[SPEAKER_12]: this image of god of a god like bob marley
but in truth he was really quite a real
[SPEAKER_12]: person who had you know his own
disagreements and his own arguments and
[SPEAKER_12]: prior to becoming rastafarian was for sure
you know a gunman like a pretty serious
[SPEAKER_12]: guy in jamaica and it was just neat to
hear these guys talking about everything
[SPEAKER_12]: in the realest the realest of ways and
talking about the guys you know who
[SPEAKER_12]: brought bob marley and peter tosh and
bunny wailer to see joe higgs and how they
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of screwed joe over and ended up
going over to coxton coxton was this
[SPEAKER_12]: full-blown like control mafia the radio
any singer and it was neat conversation it
[SPEAKER_12]: was not soft it had a sharp edge to it as
jamaican conversation often does and i
[SPEAKER_12]: just really enjoyed it they were also this
guy by the name of oh it was johnny pepper
[SPEAKER_12]: seed and he um he was a white guy but he
definitely had the voice of living in the
[SPEAKER_12]: caribbean i believe he's like uh you know
a well-known kind of radio dj guy and he
[SPEAKER_12]: was playing all all original songs from
the wailers from way back in the day and i
[SPEAKER_12]: just thought you know if you want to go on
clubhouse and stick with cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: conversations you certainly can but if you
want to break out of that there's
[SPEAKER_12]: literally conversations about everything
you can possibly imagine i ended up
[SPEAKER_12]: meeting um i got a look up his name real
quick because i caught this cat in there
[SPEAKER_12]: um i guess three days ago um corvain was
his name he just got out he just got like
[SPEAKER_12]: um he just got released from trump like he
was serving a life sentence for cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: and he just got released his name is
corvain cooper and uh i invited him on the
[SPEAKER_12]: hash church i sent a link out uh well i
didn't send the link out i sent an email
[SPEAKER_12]: out to his guy i thought it would be a
good idea to offer corvain cooper
[SPEAKER_12]: especially if he had to go fund me to
promote him through hash church to raise
[SPEAKER_12]: some money for him to create a little nest
egg for him to for re-entry because i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: not exactly sure of the entire story and i
don't want to share it here anyway i want
[SPEAKER_12]: him to share it when he finally comes on
but that was one of the things that
[SPEAKER_12]: clubhouse sort of exposed me to i also met
a woman by the name of carrie who has a
[SPEAKER_12]: really powerful story about you know
birthing a child while using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_12]: medicine and i think we're going to end up
seeing you know probably in the next two
[SPEAKER_12]: to three weeks some fairly cool folks um
that are going to kind of come over from
[SPEAKER_12]: clubhouse so i'm i'm really hoping for you
know more diversity in just getting some
[SPEAKER_12]: more females up here getting some more
black and brown people up here getting
[SPEAKER_12]: some more latinos up here just getting
some more diversity which i have to admit
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a ton of it on clubhouse hey
welcome ames institute good morning dr
[SPEAKER_03]: alec in the house talk about somebody
we've seen on clubhouse all week oh we
[SPEAKER_09]: i've seen all of your faces on clubhouse
too i'm in good company i know but your
[SPEAKER_12]: face is moving now well so is yours i know
but we don't get that on clubhouse we just
[SPEAKER_11]: get this yeah psychedelics blame the
psychedelics hey i want to let you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: know that um i got dr agarwal to do a room
on monday morning uh monday at two pacific
[SPEAKER_09]: standard um to discuss cannabis and
psychedelic medicine at the end that would
[SPEAKER_09]: be a great time for you to ask about your
hypermesis that would be you know because
[SPEAKER_03]: uh that's something for uh you know people
have been contacting me about just out of
[SPEAKER_03]: curiosity because of my friend's daughter
who has been dealing with it you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: uh it's it's still fascinating and there
needs to be definitely more science and
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding for sure yeah yeah so if
you're around too on monday um come check
[SPEAKER_09]: it out we're doing it under the cannabis
and science group just because i wanted to
[SPEAKER_09]: be able to make sure that i got a wide
audience um we're hoping at some point to
[SPEAKER_09]: have our own like ames institute club
where all of the different clinicians at
[SPEAKER_09]: the office have a chance to do like a room
once a week i won't be able to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor because uh i have my uh veterans
action council we have our working group
[SPEAKER_03]: is on monday's at two so i'm sorry we will
miss you and i will definitely be there um
[SPEAKER_09]: you know our plan is to do it um if it
goes longer then it goes longer hey alice
[SPEAKER_12]: do you know if you can invite people on
ipads with an email to clubhouse you can i
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't figured out how to do it but um i
did i just uh uploaded it onto when you
[SPEAKER_03]: download on your iphone or whatever it
automatically downloads it onto your ipad
[SPEAKER_03]: then all you have to do is go put in your
phone number and it pops up and i actually
[SPEAKER_03]: do it on my ipad so if you don't have an
iphone you can do it on ipad even if you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't have an iphone number an ios number
like you can use a samsung number uh
[SPEAKER_03]: unsure it just asks for your phone number
that you registered with uh on the
[SPEAKER_12]: clubhouse so it makes me nervous because
invites are so rare i don't get enough of
[SPEAKER_12]: them it's like and i've already i think i
pooched the first three invites i got by a
[SPEAKER_12]: i somehow sent matt stang one i just
opened it up and matt's name was there and
[SPEAKER_12]: i clicked it accidentally i was like oh my
god okay i did the same thing we all did
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i've got 11 that haven't been able to
be open because people either don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: access or they don't have an iphone so if
you have an ipad you can do it that way
[SPEAKER_09]: did i make sure i ask each person i do too
i ask each person um i do i have like
[SPEAKER_09]: eight or ten so if you need a couple of
them for people who have iphones or ipads
[SPEAKER_09]: marcus i'm happy to like i gave one for
sure gavin um uh one of our listeners here
[SPEAKER_09]: on hash church hit me up and i hooked him
up with an invite well we're i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_12]: give all my invites out to hash church
people and then i'm also asking that they
[SPEAKER_12]: give their invites out to hash church
people so that should make it a solid 20
[SPEAKER_12]: plus people and uh it is a bit of a trust
you gotta give your number and your name
[SPEAKER_12]: and i have to add the person to my
contacts i haven't been able to figure out
[SPEAKER_12]: how to add someone to clubhouse without
having their phone number and then their
[SPEAKER_12]: name in my phone there is no other way you
have to send them a text exactly so for
[SPEAKER_12]: those of you that trust me no problem if
you don't trust having your number and
[SPEAKER_12]: name given to someone who's a part of hash
church and you don't want that no problem
[SPEAKER_12]: we can you know wait until i get more
invites and if you trust me i'll give you
[SPEAKER_12]: some and if you trust the people on the
panel i'm sure they'll link you up as well
[SPEAKER_09]: believe me i'm not calling anyone so i
don't i think nowadays you can just block
[SPEAKER_12]: people even on your phone so it doesn't
even matter if someone got your phone
[SPEAKER_09]: number you know i am i just deleted it
after i finished it because it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: there's just you know i love you gavin if
you're out there but you know i don't
[SPEAKER_09]: really need your phone number someone if
if you know people want to connect back
[SPEAKER_09]: again they can always dm on instagram i
kind of like that's how clubhouse is
[SPEAKER_03]: directly in your clubhouse in your bio it
links your twitter and your instagram so
[SPEAKER_03]: if people like are interested then they
can go in and directly follow you on
[SPEAKER_03]: social media and ping you that way as
opposed to there's doesn't seem to be an
[SPEAKER_03]: instant messenger on clubhouse which is
kind of cool because we can't always go
[SPEAKER_03]: behind the scenes and see it's completely
rando and live so you know that's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fun of it too and the pain in the ass
sometimes when you're dealing with people
[SPEAKER_03]: who aren't um very good at communicating
their thoughts in a very professional
[SPEAKER_09]: manner how's that for nice no that was
really good tian i agree with you i do
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes find um that like certain people
in a room will back message me um
[SPEAKER_09]: especially if some shit's going down there
was some shit going down in a room this
[SPEAKER_09]: week um with brett bogue do you guys know
brett but you were there marcus uh i leave
[SPEAKER_12]: quickly once brett bogue enters the
picture i just i've known him for so long
[SPEAKER_12]: and he's just like and listen i have a
full appreciation for off the wall crazy
[SPEAKER_12]: but when it just when it goes beyond the
wall i just uh i i just i just remove
[SPEAKER_12]: myself rather than i don't want to ruin
anyone's good time on clubhouse and i i
[SPEAKER_12]: can get into it like i could even usually
get into it with brett bogue and that it
[SPEAKER_12]: could be the whole conversation that's
focused and i don't want to turn my
[SPEAKER_09]: clubhouse experience into that so you know
yeah i just leave i am i actually have
[SPEAKER_09]: blocked certain people that create a
negative experience for me so that when i
[SPEAKER_09]: then i can see them when i scroll down if
they're in a room and i can choose not to
[SPEAKER_12]: go in that room yeah yeah that's that's
exactly kind of the way i've been playing
[SPEAKER_12]: it and i really only have the one person
who who i feel that way otherwise the you
[SPEAKER_12]: know clubhouse has been amazing i also
find i should thank him in a sense because
[SPEAKER_12]: he's literally in every cannabis room
every minute of every day like he's not
[SPEAKER_12]: doing anything else i'm not sure where
he's raising these hundreds of millions of
[SPEAKER_12]: dollars that he's talking about but he's
definitely sitting on his ass on clubhouse
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot and so when i see him in the room i
choose to go somewhere else and often he's
[SPEAKER_12]: in the main cannabis room so i end up
finding these really random small rooms
[SPEAKER_12]: with magical people and in the sense i
should probably thank him for that some
[SPEAKER_03]: but some people are just positive examples
of how you shouldn't be yeah i woke up
[SPEAKER_13]: this morning at 6 a.m i couldn't believe
it i looked at my phone i was like really
[SPEAKER_11]: where not to go right it's almost
important where where to go you know i
[SPEAKER_11]: have to bring this up marcus because this
was your room and you had left the room at
[SPEAKER_11]: this time right so it was like me and
collin and i don't know if johnny b was
[SPEAKER_11]: still in the room at that point was i
don't i don't know if you were in there
[SPEAKER_11]: either allison but um boy that woman got
really nasty with collin for really no
[SPEAKER_11]: reason at all and like was saying negative
things that you know i think from what i
[SPEAKER_11]: understand from follow-up with collin were
just completely off base and so did you
[SPEAKER_01]: move her back down to the audience so i
tried to give her a chance to like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like i'm trying to give everybody a
voice and i knew what she was saying was
[SPEAKER_01]: was she was thinking i was someone else
and she just didn't her context was so off
[SPEAKER_01]: right and we i just had to let her finish
and then i had to be like hey so just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to let you know i'm not this person you
know that you think and you know and then
[SPEAKER_01]: like she ended up getting my number from a
grower friend of ours that used to work
[SPEAKER_01]: for me and he was she was like i'm so
sorry i can't believe i did that and like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay you know what i mean it that's
just human nature you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: information and wires get crossed and you
know we live in a world of that right now
[SPEAKER_01]: of wires crossing so i try to be um
accepting of that and know that i'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go below that because it's just
not necessary and i think to mark's point
[SPEAKER_01]: he was really out of hand and i think
someone did end up removing the the woman
[SPEAKER_01]: from the room but anyway that's that's the
kind of stuff i think um i mean it was
[SPEAKER_11]: unproductive conversation and she was
yelling and talking just to hear herself
[SPEAKER_11]: talk and everything was about negativity
about tearing collin down and it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: this isn't what this is about i mean i'm
new to this whole thing maybe i shouldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: do this but marcus bestowed a uh a
moderator on me and i just click on it and
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like you know remove her from room
yes this is unproductive this isn't what
[SPEAKER_11]: this is supposed to do i don't know if you
recall the conversation leading up to that
[SPEAKER_11]: collin she was like oh why do i need an
hplc it's like what why do i need an hplc
[SPEAKER_11]: are you kidding me you know it's really
funny collin the next night she came into
[SPEAKER_11]: our room and i was talking about what hplc
right and i was talking right about my
[SPEAKER_11]: little extraction method to try to break
the emulsion and you're like hey mark
[SPEAKER_11]: what'd you do today at the lab okay
there's what i did at the lab today and
[SPEAKER_11]: she was in there listening yeah but um
yeah that's just completely uncalled for i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean she so she thought you were somebody
else but even if you were that individual
[SPEAKER_11]: this isn't the venue to tear somebody down
you don't do right and she like she
[SPEAKER_01]: apologized she wrote me messages and she
even went into another room and apologized
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of swerve and everyone but again
it's you i think you're right and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: an honest mistake and if it was really
true then then fine but it wasn't and and
[SPEAKER_01]: we move on and we're just gonna move on
and she's not a bad woman that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the thing i think she she's very
passionate and i can i could feel that and
[SPEAKER_01]: in misinformation along with passion turns
into confrontation right i mean it just
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah can i like that she came back around
to you collin and apologize that means
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes um yeah nice about it and you know
look she's a great she's actually a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: woman so i i will say that out loud to
everyone she's really nice jenny if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: listening big love don't worry about it
it's all good you you did the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and i appreciate you and what you do for
the community around you so so thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know she brought up some great
questions about hplc i thought i think
[SPEAKER_01]: what would we're trying to get after mark
in the conversation was um it was i want
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn this into a positive here is is
when's the right application for hplc
[SPEAKER_01]: right and and can you get the same service
fast enough from another lab and how does
[SPEAKER_01]: that move forward in terms of of product
development and the products that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making or end or growing you know and i
thought you had a really good explanation
[SPEAKER_01]: for that um you know dr mark you you
really you know broke it down so so can i
[SPEAKER_09]: ask a question here um i've always been uh
i mean in my whenever i tested edibles or
[SPEAKER_09]: flour or concentrates i always turn to an
hplc over gas chromatography um is there
[SPEAKER_09]: ever a time when like you feel that you
can get a high standard of measurement
[SPEAKER_11]: from gas chromatography yeah yeah you can
get the actually a gas chromatography for
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabinoids is actually more
sensitive with a mass spec detector than
[SPEAKER_11]: hplc can even even dream to come so i mean
the sensitivity of the detector has a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: to do with how um how well the the method
works but i think the the question was is
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like it was more around do i need
internal testing when i'm spending all of
[SPEAKER_11]: this money at the third party lab and
third party lab is giving me a really good
[SPEAKER_11]: rate and they're giving me a really good
turnaround time so do i need to have that
[SPEAKER_11]: capability in house and i guess the
question or the discussion that we had
[SPEAKER_11]: with colin was well if you do if time is
money and and i can basically run like a
[SPEAKER_11]: distillation and make a distillate or make
a product and then an hour later have the
[SPEAKER_11]: information that would take a 48
turnaround time a 48 hour turnaround time
[SPEAKER_11]: at another lab well then i'm going to get
product out the door quicker because i'm
[SPEAKER_11]: not waiting that 48 hours and the other
thing is that like when you test stuff at
[SPEAKER_11]: third party labs you have to use third
party lab testing that's just kind of like
[SPEAKER_11]: the validation that your stuff is okay and
safe and you're doing testing at a lab
[SPEAKER_11]: that hopefully your results agree with
right and if your results agree with that
[SPEAKER_11]: then you're really confident when you send
those products out for your third party
[SPEAKER_11]: testing that you're going to hit exactly
where you think it's going to be if you
[SPEAKER_11]: don't have that internal testing it's like
flying a plane with no instruments the
[SPEAKER_11]: runway is there maybe you're going to hit
it maybe you're not you know i don't know
[SPEAKER_11]: and to me time is money if if we think
that there's 62 milligrams per gram of
[SPEAKER_11]: total cannabinoids in that product
thinking is not good enough we need to
[SPEAKER_11]: actually measure it and show that it's
good enough and then i don't mind spending
[SPEAKER_11]: that money at the third party lab because
i've already tested it internally so that
[SPEAKER_11]: was the nature of the discussion and she i
think she said that she came from ucan
[SPEAKER_11]: because she talked about working with tony
at ucan and i'm not sure exactly what
[SPEAKER_11]: facility she's at but i think that again a
lot of facilities debate this issue do i
[SPEAKER_11]: need internal analytics or don't i and she
was just in the camp where i don't because
[SPEAKER_11]: i have a really good relationship with my
third party lab and that's totally i guess
[SPEAKER_11]: you know a valid thing to be i was in the
other camp but that's just for you you
[SPEAKER_12]: were in the other camp the non-bankrupt
camp is that the camp you were in mark no
[SPEAKER_11]: you can't bankrupt i just want to make a
point that that's not what got her booted
[SPEAKER_11]: from the room which the discussion back
and forth with the hplc that's where it
[SPEAKER_11]: started what got her booted from the room
was the fact that she was really nasty to
[SPEAKER_11]: our friend and our and the expert colin
and that's just not going to be you know i
[SPEAKER_11]: think that's part of the hash church
brotherhood we sort of have to look out
[SPEAKER_11]: for each other marcus you know i i could
even tell you that i've had people say
[SPEAKER_11]: negative things about you to me and i'm
like no sorry that doesn't compute with me
[SPEAKER_11]: marcus i know mar i even though we've
never met you know because we've been
[SPEAKER_11]: connected on hash church all this time i
feel like i know you i feel like i know
[SPEAKER_11]: atn atn and i have actually met we've had
the luxury of actually being at a cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: cup together but you know i think that we
have to kind of look out for each other
[SPEAKER_11]: and so i think that a transition over to
clubhouse i think there has there has to
[SPEAKER_11]: be some kind of rules where again there's
a lot of negativity and a lot of nastiness
[SPEAKER_11]: for no reason whatsoever other than people
have to feel like they have to take
[SPEAKER_11]: somebody down and to me i'm just not going
to tolerate that and thank you for making
[SPEAKER_11]: me a moderator there that i could do
something about it because our friend was
[SPEAKER_11]: unfairly attacked in an unfair way for no
reason whatsoever and that just goes to
[SPEAKER_11]: show that you know the kind of people that
we are we look out for each other i think
[SPEAKER_07]: we should have a bell on clubhouse where
we ding a bell when someone's going off
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it's just like bong hit time you
know just a little readjust just a little
[SPEAKER_07]: readjust that's all we might be able to
come at this from another angle it could
[SPEAKER_12]: even be a d420k bell it could be like his
voice going bong rips mother lovers mother
[SPEAKER_07]: lovers so i mean and callan you're the
nicest guy in the world who can get mad at
[SPEAKER_07]: you i mean they have to have a really bad
day to get mad at you callan dude it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just it was false and i don't want to get
into it anymore but i i will say i did the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing for marcus you know allison you
brought up brett and i just couldn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: it and he was talking about sam and robert
and all these people that i feel just you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't you just got a you got to respect
the history and respect the groundwork and
[SPEAKER_01]: it just didn't make any sense and i just
stuck to very simple things like hey man
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have proof of this i'd love to see
it um but you know i just want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: this neutral these guys are mentors and
friends and people i look up to and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure that what you're saying
because there's a lot of people that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know the history of this in this room that
you know i just said it there's two sides
[SPEAKER_01]: to every story my man and please make sure
that what you're saying is is number one
[SPEAKER_01]: not coming from a negative place and
number two has truth to it yeah there was
[SPEAKER_11]: one guy who popped in just because he saw
the word hash he had no concept that what
[SPEAKER_11]: we've done here on hash church like he all
he knows is like hey man there's a room
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about hash i'm gonna get myself in
that room and he got in the room and he
[SPEAKER_11]: talked and he was just so funny because
again he had no concept of who marcus was
[SPEAKER_11]: no concept of bubble bags all he knew is
that he loves hash and it brought him in
[SPEAKER_09]: the room you know and that's cool you know
that's what we want to talk to people who
[SPEAKER_09]: just love hash and then that's how you
educate them about all the other things
[SPEAKER_09]: that like we have experienced in our time
within the cannabis community so it's it's
[SPEAKER_09]: cool but you know i i i have not run in
there's been very i can't even count like
[SPEAKER_09]: even on one hand how many people that um
have gone awry in a room i find that most
[SPEAKER_09]: of the moderators seem to handle it really
well and you know you can always put
[SPEAKER_09]: someone down back down in the audience and
then kind of like address the situation in
[SPEAKER_09]: vivo and um and really kind of like smooth
it out without having to engage in like um
[SPEAKER_09]: a negative back and forth interaction so
totally speaking of that why don't we uh
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't we ask everybody what they're
smoking i'd love to have a little little
[SPEAKER_01]: uh yeah you said bong rip mother lovers so
let's get a bong it going everybody get me
[SPEAKER_03]: get me all enticed here what is everybody
smoking on i'm doing some garlotta from
[SPEAKER_01]: oakland extracts right now i have some
strong nana here that i cold cured that
[SPEAKER_07]: i'm dying to try got some really good
subsidium uh extracts here from ontario
[SPEAKER_07]: some cookie dough and some cannabin nerd
we got some bubble gum i'm really enjoying
[SPEAKER_07]: this uh sunny dough light which is a dosey
dough by sour tangy and i have to say the
[SPEAKER_07]: sour tangy is one of the sweetest clones
out there love sour tangy my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy reminds me of calio a lot with like
a little bit extra gas and a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: stronger of a of a cannabinoid profile but
dude tom tom surely has not he's smoking
[SPEAKER_12]: nothing right now so why don't we pour a
little out for tom right now we're so
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry tom that sucks i wish that you had
something and uh let's hope that you have
[SPEAKER_12]: something for next task church my goodness
everyone needs something i'm gonna hit on
[SPEAKER_09]: some of this uh lemon peel dog walker um
90u from archive the dog walker so marcus
[SPEAKER_01]: the bubble last time i had dog walker was
the bubble man brand terp sauce that was
[SPEAKER_01]: made and that dog walker has always left a
lasting impression on me from that batch
[SPEAKER_01]: that was done so it's a unique variety
does anyone know the the lineage behind
[SPEAKER_01]: dog walker i know it's like walker from
oregon but it's albert walker it's albert
[SPEAKER_09]: i think i think or my chem 91 oh i thought
it was albert walker crossed with dog shit
[SPEAKER_11]: i thought it was chem 91 here it could
explain why it hits all my notes you know
[SPEAKER_09]: i know it's albert walker well let's
figure out whether it's dog shit or chem
[SPEAKER_12]: 91 that was another one jeff always had
access to he was always walking the walker
[SPEAKER_12]: he was always rocking the hamster he was
always rocking these like unique things
[SPEAKER_12]: from back in the day that cat piss we had
that up here too yeah it reminds me of
[SPEAKER_09]: sour diesel a lot actually and then you
know if jeff gets it then you know that
[SPEAKER_09]: fletch is gonna get it it's kind of how
that works or back and forth dog walker by
[SPEAKER_11]: chem 91 yeah there you go in portland
oregon i know the guy who made that so do
[SPEAKER_07]: we we've been smoking the chem dog since
day one i mean the the dog shit dog shit
[SPEAKER_07]: or dog walker well not dog walker the dog
shit i mean does anyone smoke the dog shit
[SPEAKER_07]: i mean it's a classic oregon strain for
sure depends on what kind of dog you have
[SPEAKER_07]: really definitely um what about the
trinity strain or does anyone remember the
[SPEAKER_07]: trinity strain yeah yeah i remember it i
have a daughter named trinity so obviously
[SPEAKER_07]: i remember it i mean it was the what we
used to get in eugene was like a big
[SPEAKER_07]: crystal leaf wrapped bud it wasn't like
the traditional bud that you'd see before
[SPEAKER_07]: it was like the leaves were left and they
were just there was so much crystal on it
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there was a variety called the
white witch which came into eugene for a
[SPEAKER_07]: long time and that was hands down
everyone's like if when the white witch
[SPEAKER_07]: came to town everyone was just like oh
shit you know we got to get some of that
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah richard in the chat you are correct
that's rich cromelin who bred dog walker
[SPEAKER_11]: which is yes the albert walker cross with
chem 91 so yes you know are are in oregon
[SPEAKER_07]: too as well with the oregon the uh the
dragon or the uh what is it the dog bud
[SPEAKER_07]: which came that they were saying was
crossed and to create the chem dog to
[SPEAKER_11]: begin with uh dog bud was that out of
oregon i mean those those cats were from
[SPEAKER_11]: crested butte colorado but i thought that
they had said that that lineage actually
[SPEAKER_11]: came from north out but that you know p
bud um well dog bud which i guess again
[SPEAKER_11]: was the precursor in that lineage i think
was out of crested butte i believe i think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's accurate from my my knowledge uh dr
mark and it's fun that you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those lot seeds you know i i i certainly
have a a jar that's halfway full of lot
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that i'm i'm gonna start going
through this year so i'm excited to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what that looks like but there is so much
amazing stuff i mean mark you lived it so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know um that just i i you know i'm
excited to see what if anything comes of
[SPEAKER_01]: it but all that stuff is so memorable from
all the kems and then of course the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just a big part of you know me as
a as a as a younger self yeah we were
[SPEAKER_11]: talking in the clubhouse the other day to
rachel who's from university of amherst i
[SPEAKER_11]: don't know if you remember that marcus and
collin remember that that woman rachel who
[SPEAKER_11]: was in the room yeah i was almost going to
mention to her that you know um so kem is
[SPEAKER_11]: now working with canna provisions so canna
provisions is meg sanders's business uh
[SPEAKER_11]: meg used to be the owner of mindful in
denver we were talking with mohegan
[SPEAKER_11]: richmond he we were talking about walking
out of that weed grow in the denver police
[SPEAKER_11]: station is right there that's mindful
right and so meg sanders she was on 60
[SPEAKER_11]: minutes i mean she was definitely one of
the women ceos early on recognized in the
[SPEAKER_11]: denver cannabis industry anyway she's out
in massachusetts now uh working in a place
[SPEAKER_11]: called canna provisions along with her uh
significant other eric and and they have
[SPEAKER_11]: hired kem uh you know greg greg yeah yeah
so greg is working with those guys now i
[SPEAKER_11]: think it just as a as a growth consultant
so that's a shout out to kem man yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a i've definitely i've wholesaled
to those guys a bunch they're they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: good outfit i think they're doing a lot of
good things in the state and i can't wait
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what they kind of you know work
working with greg i can't wait to see what
[SPEAKER_11]: they do because i know that meg's awesome
meg meg has just always been a leader in
[SPEAKER_11]: the industry and she just she knows
nonsense and everything she's done has
[SPEAKER_11]: been really really great i mean it you
know i was so happy to see uh you know
[SPEAKER_11]: greg land there because he definitely
deserves a role in the industry so p bud i
[SPEAKER_11]: think is down in florida now but we were
talking about p bud because i guess one
[SPEAKER_11]: plant right yeah well that guy that was in
the room was talking about mike the other
[SPEAKER_01]: right yeah he was actually a processor for
for one plant he was talking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: they were switching from because i've been
watching their evolution i mean front they
[SPEAKER_01]: were first doing greenhouse now they're
back indoor i mean i can see why they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it from a commercial setting point
of view it's just you know there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more security in in your environment down
in that particular part of the world for
[SPEAKER_01]: green you know versus greenhouse but i'm
sure vpd must have been crazy to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: down there you know like walking one day
or like oh my god it's like you know 90
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity or whatever um but yeah they're
doing a fantastic job i think he's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know he's really he's expanded a lot with
him i thought i actually thought greg was
[SPEAKER_11]: working with one plant as well i wasn't
sure yeah i don't know uh skunk man your
[SPEAKER_11]: name comes up all the time i mean it's so
funny right marcus we're talking about uh
[SPEAKER_12]: well i i want to send him an iphone just
so we can get on clubhouse clubhouse is
[SPEAKER_11]: waiting for you sam i mean you kind of you
come up in conversation on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_11]: almost like every other hour can you hear
yeah but he can like we can barely we can
[SPEAKER_03]: barely hear you barely hear you there sam
you need to get closer to your mic i love
[SPEAKER_12]: that i know this guy so well that i can
actually picture no we still can't hear
[SPEAKER_12]: you i can actually picture exactly what
he's doing in his house going from his
[SPEAKER_12]: chair over to where he keeps his computer
like 12 15 feet away fix it we need to
[SPEAKER_12]: hear you sam and clubhouse also would like
to hear you like uh dr mark says your name
[SPEAKER_12]: definitely comes up a schwack and i think
you'd probably spend maybe the first
[SPEAKER_12]: hundred hours just sort of correcting what
people are talking about in regards to
[SPEAKER_12]: breeding and what is the land race and
what is a hybrid and and sort of all that
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff i don't pretend to know that
information well enough so i just listen
[SPEAKER_12]: and cringe but i think man i got it to the
strands oh man that one that one was like
[SPEAKER_12]: prevalent that one i can swallow you know
it's just like okay it's just a funny
[SPEAKER_12]: lingo or whatever but it does seem to
connect with the not knowing and and the
[SPEAKER_12]: not knowing is the very thing that you're
kind of trying to get out of when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to learn right but the cvds the
cvds people the the thc's stop stop stop i
[SPEAKER_11]: like that guy big grease the strands big
big grease and we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_11]: the uh joint you know we're talking about
ash you know and everything like that and
[SPEAKER_11]: he was talking about the ring of oil in
the joint and he called it the ru ring of
[SPEAKER_12]: oil i'm like nice that was awesome shout
out to big grease for sure because i like
[SPEAKER_12]: that dude we got to get him on dude i'm
about to say he seems cool right marcus he
[SPEAKER_04]: seems cool he seems like he's dialed in
that guy he speaks my language 100 percent
[SPEAKER_12]: let's just say he has a level of awareness
that we're looking for exactly for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure yeah he says a seat at this table
for sure just from the knowledge he's
[SPEAKER_03]: dropping and he's correcting people
properly and you know it's it's it's good
[SPEAKER_07]: to hear i was having a conversation about
wade the other day and maybe you could
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that i was saying the right
thing and it was about maybe it wasn't i
[SPEAKER_07]: don't forget maybe it was on tarli live
but um uh it was about when you discovered
[SPEAKER_07]: the harlequin and were you i guess i guess
i'll just ask the question in case anyone
[SPEAKER_07]: has a hurry up were you grounding pots
when you found the harlequin or the high
[SPEAKER_07]: cbd were they thc varieties and what lab
were you using at the time um yeah you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have that quite right uh yes i was
grounding pots at that point it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment that i was trying because um i
was doing everything indoors in those days
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah i had just sprouted the seeds
that came from switzerland but i was
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the flowering room and i
meditating about what was going on why i
[SPEAKER_00]: could feel that the plants were not all
the way there to happy and so i just said
[SPEAKER_00]: you know i ran down the list of all the
things i was doing to make sure everything
[SPEAKER_00]: was perfect for the plants that i was
growing at that point and what i heard was
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were lonely and i couldn't quite
grok what that was about until i realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that plants evolved in the earth and the
earth has a natural frequency of its own
[SPEAKER_00]: uh i think it's six or seven hertz and um
and so i uh yeah i figured out a way by
[SPEAKER_00]: putting a grounding bar on a copper pipe
in the in the grow room and ran some uh i
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was 10-3 romex uh so i had four
fat number 10 wires uh i hooked one end of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of those wires up to the copper water
pipe that went to ground because i put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in myself and then the other end of it i
stuck into four plants and those four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at that point yeah what ended up
being named harlequin was uh those four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and i had i had seven total that i
had grown out it was the second batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts i'd taken from the original seedling
that i was so interested in and um and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grounded plants grew so dramatically
quicker i mean one of the first things i
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed in addition to how much taller
they were than their three sisters was
[SPEAKER_00]: when they started setting flowers i was
used to seeing flowers about two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into their flowering cycle that were about
the size of a pencil eraser and this is on
[SPEAKER_00]: things like bubba kush or um grape ape
that i was growing in those days and um
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that were hooked the the three
plants that weren't hooked to ground the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers at um two weeks were more about
the size of my little fingernail as versus
[SPEAKER_00]: a pencil eraser and the ones that were on
ground that were hooked up to ground were
[SPEAKER_00]: already starting to be changing colors
they weren't just green all of a sudden uh
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything else in the room that was
green uh they were starting to show other
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and the flowers at two weeks were
as big as my index fingernail so the the
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of blew my mind what was happening
with that and part of why um part of why
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so memorable is uh at this time um
nico escondido was in san francisco at a
[SPEAKER_00]: trade show and um one of the people i did
business with had asked me for some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers to give out at the show uh for
folks who were coming in from out of town
[SPEAKER_00]: and nico ended up with a handful of those
flowers and we had a label in those days
[SPEAKER_00]: and nice little package and uh so he was
interested and wanted to see what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on when he came over to the shop um
one of the first questions he asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: once we were in the flowering room was
what the hell is up with these wires going
[SPEAKER_00]: over here to the plants and so i explained
to him what was going on and yeah by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time those four plants finished flowering
they were the the colas on them were as
[SPEAKER_00]: big as my calf i mean they were just huge
and uh the three wade you just got muted
[SPEAKER_00]: on accident oh sorry and sorry for the
long story fellas but um no take your time
[SPEAKER_07]: this may be the most important story on
hash church i doubt that but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating story and part of why i love
the story is it's how i learn it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you you think of things that might be
going on with your plants or your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation or your extraction process
whatever and then you set up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to try and verify what's going
on if this idea is real and yeah the
[SPEAKER_00]: grounding thing was uh impressive enough
to uh nico that about six months after he
[SPEAKER_00]: was in my flowering room there was a
company uh selling a product in high times
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the products hot new
products thing that was a little white box
[SPEAKER_00]: you could plug into the wall in your house
and it had four little wires you plugged
[SPEAKER_00]: into the white box and a little red light
that came on that said you had ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and then you had some wires that you
could plug into your plants but what's
[SPEAKER_00]: true is yeah i'm utterly convinced that if
you have all of the things in your room
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in in terms of environment
temperature the quality of your water the
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity in your soil all of those
things are sorted out you've got the right
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting everything else if you then
provide ground to just a few of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants i think you'll be astounded at the
difference because plants evolved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth and this is you know sam has talked
about how important genetics are in how
[SPEAKER_00]: well plants do in the environment that
they are growing in and if you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors you can shape that environment if
you're in a greenhouse you can shape it to
[SPEAKER_00]: some extent but if you're outdoors in the
sun and in the earth you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for and find the genetics that work
in the spot you're in if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the best results of what the cannabis
genetics can provide for you in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis chemistry thank you so beautiful
also what about the the testing component
[SPEAKER_07]: that i may have had that part wrong so
please and i was saying i think i'm saying
[SPEAKER_07]: as i was saying it that i may not have it
right so i'm i really wanted to clarify so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you well in those in those in that
batch of seeds that we got from
[SPEAKER_00]: switzerland there were at least two
different phenotypes in the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted and and again harlequin really
stood out it was one of the phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the just one seed but it was
so different than the other phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that i was looking at that i kind of went
crazy follow your passion is the message
[SPEAKER_00]: there but the other phenotype that we
tested the one that was worthy of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out because in an indoor environment we
had fairly limited space and had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly selective about eliminating things
that we weren't that interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other phenotype that we tested was a high
thc variety and the testing that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at that point harborside was one of
the vendors that i was that our product
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to and and they had just opened
up steep hill labs and so yeah i went in
[SPEAKER_00]: and talked to them about it because i was
a vendor they were willing to do it they
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't started testing all their flowers
at this point and yeah they i think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred dollars a pop for cannabinoids
and so i that's how i knew the one was
[SPEAKER_00]: high thc and then the other one like i
said it came back it was uh i think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: eight and a half percent cbd and five and
a half percent thc at eight weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and um and yeah they were pretty
excited they pointed me towards uh fred
[SPEAKER_00]: gardner uh the publisher of
o'Shaughnessy's and uh i spent some time
[SPEAKER_00]: learning a little bit more about him
before i gave him a call and um out of
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting him and a couple of other people
who had found some cbd cultivars uh we
[SPEAKER_00]: started what's now known as project cbd
and it was uh quite a project sorting out
[SPEAKER_00]: what were we going to do with these plants
because one of the folks that um had this
[SPEAKER_00]: high cbd thing going on was me and i was
already giving it away fast and furious
[SPEAKER_00]: because i was learning more and more about
what cbd could do for folks uh one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other people was kind of eh i don't know
maybe we should hold on to this this might
[SPEAKER_00]: be worth money and the third fellow was
like dude this is a fucking gold mine what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you doing giving it away and um i'm
still good friends with both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: fellows um and there were other folks
involved in the conversation including
[SPEAKER_00]: fred and martin lee but um i really and i
still feel like you know when you find
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's unique and special um and
offers benefit to folks ringo laurence
[SPEAKER_07]: involved in that time period uh was ringo
laurence using period yeah laurence ringo
[SPEAKER_00]: uh ringo was the name he went by laurence
was his first name right and um no he was
[SPEAKER_00]: not involved at the beginning with project
cbd uh i met him through um fred and um
[SPEAKER_00]: samantha miller of pure analytics uh and
samantha was working with laurence quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit yeah yeah samantha's a brilliant
chemist and uh analytical chemist and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing really good work in the compassion
realm for years um and yeah laurence uh
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the first conversations we had he
said he had gotten some harlem quinn
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings and was going to cross it with a
sour tsunami and how did i feel about that
[SPEAKER_00]: and i just thought that was a great thing
so yeah we became good friends and um i've
[SPEAKER_00]: i've done quite a bit of work with harley
sue the cross that he made there uh sour
[SPEAKER_00]: tsunami uh canna sue um all of the
cultivars that have cbd in them that end
[SPEAKER_00]: in tsu are from laurence ringo's work
ringo's gift is another beautiful cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: that does quite well in northern
california um and laurence died uh
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly a few years ago it was kind of a
heartbreaking thing because he was he was
[SPEAKER_00]: such a beautiful guy and he did uh yeah he
did a lot of great work in the compassion
[SPEAKER_00]: realm i just gotta say much love out there
ringo i hear you and feel you in the room
[SPEAKER_12]: with us um yeah thanks for sharing wade uh
that's awesome and yeah huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_12]: uh to ringo well-known cannabis warrior
doing the good work and uh man if anyone
[SPEAKER_12]: else has ringo stories let's uh let's keep
his vibes alive a lot of the dm pure
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers in northern california have been
growing out a lot of the ringo's gifts a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of the harla sues a lot of those you
know cbd varieties over the years so you
[SPEAKER_07]: know big up to the the dm pure family and
keeping that that alive also we grew um
[SPEAKER_07]: the harla sues that we grew this year were
just twice the size of everything else in
[SPEAKER_07]: the greenhouse and um really large large
style buds i just want to point out i
[SPEAKER_07]: think it's really phenomenal that you were
on your second cloning uh grow when you
[SPEAKER_07]: then grounded it and it really changed the
plant i think that's just a really
[SPEAKER_07]: important teaching and a really beautiful
teaching on how you can affect your plant
[SPEAKER_07]: with such a simple you know action and
anyone could plug a wire into a ground and
[SPEAKER_07]: make that happen and i think that's really
great but yeah the um cbd also with the
[SPEAKER_07]: cbd we were in colorado welcome kel hi
everybody i was doing some things this
[SPEAKER_08]: morning it's so lovely to see you and i've
been listening in the background i had
[SPEAKER_08]: some work to do good morning happy sunday
it's so lovely to be here morning good
[SPEAKER_07]: morning lovely dear super quick story
again about cbd we can move on whenever
[SPEAKER_07]: but we were in colorado um you know i
don't know five or six years ago and
[SPEAKER_07]: visiting uh uh centennial seeds and uh the
the cbd seed company out in denver and uh
[SPEAKER_07]: is it ben then yeah and he was he had a gl
uh gas chromatography machine like in his
[SPEAKER_07]: warehouse and in his grill along with
record players which i like the record
[SPEAKER_07]: players so i think the vinyl is an
important component and that's probably
[SPEAKER_07]: the synthesizers too colin if we're real
but um anyway eight years ago it was a
[SPEAKER_07]: long time ago is it beginning of the whole
entire you know uh movement in colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: with cbd and it was really cool to go
through his and it was just what you were
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about you know he was able to look
at all of his plants through his own home
[SPEAKER_07]: gas chromatography cannabinoid machine and
he was keeping all of his own notes and he
[SPEAKER_07]: was really progressing at the time and it
was really cool to see um you know to see
[SPEAKER_07]: it go from sort of what wade and ringo and
and the families out in california were
[SPEAKER_07]: doing to then like to a more commercial
scale out in and colorado and then come
[SPEAKER_07]: back now to oregon and see what oregon's
done with it is just pretty amazing and
[SPEAKER_08]: ben is sort of like one of the unsung
heroes just like bode out there in
[SPEAKER_08]: colorado as well you know those guys were
searching for cbd and have well long
[SPEAKER_08]: before it was even sort of the end thing
to talk about and to go into ben's
[SPEAKER_08]: laboratory is like hilarious he's got like
his gas chromatography in the corner and
[SPEAKER_08]: then stacks of records like more records
than you've ever seen in your entire life
[SPEAKER_08]: and he just sits in there and just runs
sample after sample after sample you know
[SPEAKER_07]: with the storefront in front of it you
know where you can sell the seeds it's
[SPEAKER_07]: sweet it was i don't know what's happening
at the moment because we haven't been
[SPEAKER_11]: there but yeah i have a question in this
story and i've been asked this question
[SPEAKER_11]: before and wade maybe you could give me
some color or you know certainly anybody
[SPEAKER_11]: on the panel that knows how does how
exactly does the stanley brothers
[SPEAKER_11]: charlotte webb charlotte's webb fit into
that lineage or does it not fit into the
[SPEAKER_11]: lineage or was that something completely
different or completely different yeah i
[SPEAKER_01]: remember i think it wasn't it's a r4 cut
guys i don't know at the same time that's
[SPEAKER_13]: when uh even up here in nvc when we tested
a sample that was named hayley's comet
[SPEAKER_13]: that came from franklin from the nymo it
was like 13 cbd five percent thc it was
[SPEAKER_13]: that two to one same kind of like it was
all around that same time as a harlequin
[SPEAKER_13]: as the stanley brothers came out with
charlotte's webb and there's that big
[SPEAKER_13]: craze i think uh hayley's comet was around
2008 though one was harlequin queen what
[SPEAKER_13]: year was that about 2008 as well yeah but
remember that it's around the same time
[SPEAKER_13]: because i mean and same with charlotte's
webb wasn't around that same time too and
[SPEAKER_07]: the and also the cana tonics and and it's
important to note that spain was doing a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of work as well at the time and still
does so big shout out we've met a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: those breeders at emerald cup over the
years and if they're listening we
[SPEAKER_12]: appreciate you so how about a shout out to
skunk man sam who might have been doing
[SPEAKER_12]: his work 20 years prior to anyone we just
mentioned yeah true that and also shanti
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cbd crew what's the i don't know
much about what when they started does
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone know what what the story with that
is uh back in 20 13 i think it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring i got a handful of seeds about
seven different packets that ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from jamie at rosin seeds which is
the spanish i'm not sure about the
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate structure there but it's my
understanding heimi sorry i've never met
[SPEAKER_00]: the man nor spoken to him in person but oh
you'd like yeah i got it yeah i've been
[SPEAKER_00]: told that uh but meantime yeah was asked
to beta test a bunch of seeds and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were seven different things there and one
of those today i learned was named
[SPEAKER_00]: medihaze and there was a cut a specific
version of one of those medihaze seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that caught my eye just like harlequin we
made cuts of that and got it out here in
[SPEAKER_00]: northern california and i always point to
cbd crew as the source of those seeds but
[SPEAKER_00]: part of why i wanted to mention medihaze
specifically is forest and his son silas
[SPEAKER_00]: who was on hash church with us at one
point they're still struggling with
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy and forest has really had to
withdraw from his cannabis advocacy trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep silas alive is really what it
boils down to but medihaze was the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar the specific cultivar from heimi
and the folks in spain that gay that silas
[SPEAKER_00]: went from having a hundred seizures a day
over a period of months and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going back and forth on trying to keep him
alive basically and he got some medihaze
[SPEAKER_00]: oil on a friday night didn't have any
seizures friday night and then as they
[SPEAKER_00]: kept giving him this oil he went four
months before he had another seizure it
[SPEAKER_00]: was insane the change what's the ratio of
cannabinoids in that again similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: harlequin different terpenes and probably
different cannabinoids but it was a it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: two to one as well so another two to one
yeah now the medihaze i mean way do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that there's something to that i
mean oh i'm utterly convinced yes right
[SPEAKER_00]: it's why hemp is not the answer i'm sorry
you know i love hemp it's the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it's the same thing but i think the
real magic at least in my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: working with people i've worked with over
the years the real magic happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got cvd and thc and a bunch of the
other cannabinoids all together there's
[SPEAKER_00]: that ensemble thing it's a real phenomenon
in patient experience that's what i've
[SPEAKER_11]: seen again and again just to be clear it's
two cvd for every one thc right well
[SPEAKER_00]: harlequin and medihaze were both that what
you just said like some people say
[SPEAKER_00]: harlequin can be a three to one and i
think that depends on when it's harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i think there's a change that happens
in ratio depending on harvest date right
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars but i'm pretty convinced that
more important than the ratio in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what benefit is happening for a person is
it really has to do with how much thc can
[SPEAKER_00]: a person tolerate in terms of using a
cannabis product over a period of time if
[SPEAKER_00]: they enjoy thc then they might want
something that has more thc than cvd but
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm pretty convinced that the best benefit
in terms of your health and your
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being and your feeling good is going
to have some cvd mixed into the thc sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: sam but i feel that strong that's one
thing i recommend to a lot of my cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patients and my business partner he
actually had cancer and i put him on that
[SPEAKER_03]: regimen and it it got rid of his cancer
along with conventional treatments so and
[SPEAKER_03]: i just want to also clarify is you're
going to be heartfelt to find any cvd
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to 2008 in the united states
domestically because it wasn't until we
[SPEAKER_03]: started testing then in 2007 2008 for thc
that we found that secondary spike that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like what the fuck is this and we
were able to uh find that in machulam's uh
[SPEAKER_03]: now i know of course sam has been doing
this for a long time but you know i was
[SPEAKER_03]: part of that team here in america that
we're actually trying to test that so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's when those secondary spikes were
mostly found so most of your cvd is from
[SPEAKER_03]: 2008 forward domestically that i'm aware
of yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna add something
[SPEAKER_09]: i want to add something really quick so
this is what we see in our office we work
[SPEAKER_09]: with a lot of oncology patients and the
ones who are using um cvd with thc tend to
[SPEAKER_09]: have better results than those who are
just using like something from rite aid
[SPEAKER_09]: that's a hemp derived cvd um and uh you
know i i would love to hear more what sam
[SPEAKER_09]: has to say um about that but that's just
what we see well can you hear me now yes
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely yes sir yes sir leave it
charlie okay well i just wanted to say
[SPEAKER_06]: that we started our cvd work in the mid
and late 80s that's when we started and we
[SPEAKER_06]: had a cvd plant by 1990 that was about 10
cvd with less than a point uh three
[SPEAKER_06]: percent uh thc so we were focused on a cvd
only plant and that's what we came up with
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's hard to get a high cvd only
plant because the cvd synthase itself
[SPEAKER_06]: produces thc even if you have no thc
synthase in your plant so uh it's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely difficult and uh the bottom line
is we started in the late 80s and uh we
[SPEAKER_06]: told fred gardner about our work and uh
that that helped kick off the whole uh uh
[SPEAKER_06]: cvd uh quest uh because they heard it
existed we told them we had it uh but uh
[SPEAKER_06]: we we licensed it to a pharmaceutical
company to pay for our research and
[SPEAKER_06]: development and uh yeah i i i think cvd is
amazing and all the time people are making
[SPEAKER_06]: fun of me because i say i don't like it
you know it's as it because i don't need
[SPEAKER_06]: it for medical benefit if i needed it for
medical benefit i would like it and we did
[SPEAKER_06]: stick our necks out on the limb uh you
know in the late 80s and developed a cvd
[SPEAKER_06]: only variety and we were able to do that
with uh uh gas chromatography and high
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure liquid chromatography and uh oh i
i want to say something else too dr alison
[SPEAKER_06]: asked what is the gc useful for well
another thing no the cv no i i meant like
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp derived um cvd versus cannabis
derived um cvd no i was talking you asked
[SPEAKER_06]: about a gc chromatography what was it
useful for oh yes sir yes sir okay and uh
[SPEAKER_06]: they're very useful for determining
terpenes we always use gcf id for the last
[SPEAKER_06]: uh 30 years and uh that was a state of the
art maybe there's some more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_06]: ones that i'm not as aware of uh today but
uh gcf id for terpenes is is the answer
[SPEAKER_12]: quick question sam from hermatia elusen um
you had hplc and analytical standards for
[SPEAKER_12]: thc and cvd by 1990 oh earlier yes and how
did you do that well first of all the only
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid that's controlled in the
netherlands which we didn't possess until
[SPEAKER_06]: uh the very early 90s when we were
licensed but the only cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_06]: are controlled is uh delta 9 and delta 8
all the other cannabinoids are not
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled in the netherlands if you can
find them or isolate them yourself or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever did you get testing standards
like from segre and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely but we we made uh ones
ourselves that were actually purer and
[SPEAKER_03]: better than segre or yeah that's what we
did we had to bring in you know dr hoskop
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually make the solution since he was
making the solutions for the dutch it was
[SPEAKER_03]: easy for him to once we had him in a lab
here domestically then he was actually
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do gas chromatograph and uv hplc
so that we had both online to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: quantify just again just thc yeah well our
problem was when we got segre standards uh
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the first sources we got uh when we
they said they were 98 pure when we tested
[SPEAKER_06]: them they were 86 pure thc so uh you know
if you have numbers that screwed up from
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning all of your work will be
screwed up because it's built on that
[SPEAKER_03]: foundation right that screw is your ring
testing in every way shape or form yes
[SPEAKER_06]: except for i was doing ring testing with
dr el sole and brend eisen in switzerland
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh the three of us were getting
identical results i knew we were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: something right that's how we do it ladies
and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_08]: um wait i wanted to just back up really
quick um and just talk about how you're
[SPEAKER_08]: really finding you know those one-to-ones
or you know where thc is heavily present
[SPEAKER_08]: as well i feel like um you know we've been
treating patients for 25 years and as the
[SPEAKER_08]: information you know comes to light there
was a lot more thc we didn't have testing
[SPEAKER_08]: back at that time but we were using a lot
of old varietals so my guess is that there
[SPEAKER_08]: was a lot of cbd in those sort of land
race-ish varietals that we had at those
[SPEAKER_08]: times and i noticed that when we were
making medicine say like in the early 90s
[SPEAKER_08]: the late 80s um it seemed like it was
helping people more more quickly and then
[SPEAKER_08]: as the varietals started to change they
were becoming more hybridized more higher
[SPEAKER_08]: thc the same medicine that we were making
i was finding that we were needing more
[SPEAKER_08]: like heroic doses of it to where people
were really sort of like you know out they
[SPEAKER_08]: were only waking up to to go to shower to
eat to go to the bathroom it was healing
[SPEAKER_08]: them but they weren't having you know they
were just having to take more and as we
[SPEAKER_08]: started to then get in more the varietals
of the one-to-one i was seeing that
[SPEAKER_08]: healing again with the same medicine that
we were making except even more exorbitant
[SPEAKER_08]: and the patients were having to use even
less and now the next step to that is and
[SPEAKER_08]: i just wanted to introduce here is
utilizing hemp but at super high
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrations as a whole plant medicine
so that you're getting much higher thc
[SPEAKER_08]: levels along with much higher cbd levels
we're really noticing that that also seems
[SPEAKER_08]: to be a real magic key and when i'm saying
like whole plant extraction you know we're
[SPEAKER_08]: using maybe like you know a hemp that's
you know 23 percent to maybe a 0.6 or
[SPEAKER_08]: something like that is is about the
numbers an average of what we're getting
[SPEAKER_08]: we're adding about two pounds of really
intense flour into an oil so it's a super
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrated so the thc levels are much
higher and i feel like even with that
[SPEAKER_08]: progression we're noticing that you're
having to take maybe even less of that
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine to get to the same results this
is totally ongoing observation it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: lifelong experiment of of medicine but
also as much as we're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: compounding cannabinoids also compounding
plant medicine with cannabis i feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: is equally as important as compounding all
of the cannabinoids for the medicine so
[SPEAKER_08]: sorry i went off on a rant on that but
like mushrooms and like kava kava and i
[SPEAKER_08]: could go on and on and different types of
chinese herbs and roots and josh said
[SPEAKER_08]: astragalus you know i could go on and on
with important compounding and looking at
[SPEAKER_08]: different symptoms like cbd and thc are
wonderful symptomatic healers and they can
[SPEAKER_08]: be total curatives but when we add
different compounds of other types of
[SPEAKER_08]: medicines and we bring in other plant
intelligence into it then we're
[SPEAKER_08]: compounding the cannabinoids the terpenes
and all of the other alkaloids and other
[SPEAKER_08]: plant compounds that um you know can go
hand in hand sorry for the long wind there
[SPEAKER_00]: uh well i would say sam would probably
have a better uh opinion on what sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids were in the early land races
that came to north america but i i
[SPEAKER_00]: remember reading at one point some
information from the drug enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: administration where they were running
analytical testing for cannabinoids on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that had been seized coming into
the united states as part of law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement action and yeah a lot of the
cannabis that was coming in from mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: and from jamaica are two places that i
remember that had cbd and thc together and
[SPEAKER_00]: so i'm not surprised that your observation
is that 20 some years ago you felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: people were seeing benefit at lower doses
because in the 50 years that we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis on any scale in north america
most of us were breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity so we were breeding out cbd
without really understanding that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on we were just trying to
optimize the get high experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful job right flavor too and yes oh
yeah yeah yeah yeah the flavor and get
[SPEAKER_00]: high so terpenes and all of that and yeah
i i love the diversity of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because all of these different
experiences that we are mostly talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about on hash church associated with
cannabinoids we're primarily talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: thc and thc is a wonderful cannabinoid but
there's all of the other things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the plant are part of what
makes the difference between something
[SPEAKER_00]: like headband and northern lights you know
they're just there's so much variety and
[SPEAKER_00]: yet most of the chemistry is similar when
you're talking about just thc or cbd but
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start talking about minor
cannabinoids and other terpenes and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just it it's astounding and beautiful the
majesty of this plant and what she can
[SPEAKER_00]: create for us and yeah i to circle back to
ratios and cbd and thc i'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you took pure thc and pure cbd and
put them into a product at whatever ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted you wouldn't see the benefit
that you would see if you made an oil from
[SPEAKER_00]: something like medihate where you did the
best you could to preserve the original
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry of that you were saying kelly at
lower doses we see much better benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's whole plant versions of cbd
thc minor cannabinoids flavonoids and i
[SPEAKER_00]: for one am utterly convinced that other
herbal and fungal allies will be of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to us in conjunction with cannabis
particularly the psychedelic realm but
[SPEAKER_00]: because i don't have much experience or
practice with it myself i i don't speak
[SPEAKER_00]: much about it here but i do use all kinds
of herbs in my own care for working with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people i just offer cannabis and
that's kind of where i'm at with that uh
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i'm utterly convinced uh whole plant
cbd and thc and whatever ratio works for
[SPEAKER_00]: the end user you'll see much better
results at much lower doses i'm trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: like turn my microphone and i realize
cutting out cutting out you're in a car
[SPEAKER_03]: you're on mute now you're on mute i'm
gonna explain that time marcus where you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to cut me off because i was getting on
a conference call yeah you were starting a
[SPEAKER_12]: zoom call it was good yeah i think there
was another one that happened like that
[SPEAKER_12]: the other day that we were oh was the pop
brothers at law they came into a room and
[SPEAKER_12]: those guys are already kind of like you
know they there are these kind of loud
[SPEAKER_12]: lawyer-like guys that are like hey you
don't keep your fucking mouth shut they're
[SPEAKER_12]: hilarious i i like them but uh he was he
was on like a call in his office like i'll
[SPEAKER_12]: mute you nice to be able to mute people
when they forget to be muted johnny b's
[SPEAKER_12]: trained me like i'm i have a black belt in
muting people at this point in time uh
[SPEAKER_12]: over five years of hash church where are
you johnny b come on unmute your mic for
[SPEAKER_12]: me and uh crinkle some uh parchment and
shout out to brian from best friend farms
[SPEAKER_12]: dude how the hell are you doing you're
laughing over there oh i'm doing well nice
[SPEAKER_10]: to see you guys just having a good old
time dude a lot of people ask me if the
[SPEAKER_12]: picture of rosin on the front page of this
hash church was yours so many people ask
[SPEAKER_12]: me that and i have to shout out whose it
was because that rosin belonged to good
[SPEAKER_12]: buds i believe it was snow god but it
might have been time warp and it was this
[SPEAKER_12]: young kid i think he's like 19 years old
he works over at good buds on felt spring
[SPEAKER_12]: island his name is tristan columbian c o l
l o m b i n tristan with an a d r i s d a
[SPEAKER_12]: n i wanted to shout him out because he
made that bubble he made that rosin he
[SPEAKER_12]: took that picture and although i knew he
would be stoked when i used it on the
[SPEAKER_12]: front of hash church uh there was no i
couldn't figure out a way to shout him out
[SPEAKER_12]: so i'll put a little shout out for him in
the comment section once the youtube video
[SPEAKER_12]: is actually up and uh i have also just
shouted him out now and man it's uh a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of people know your resin when resin looks
like your resin they think it's your resin
[SPEAKER_10]: well nice work to homie there definitely
shout him out we've been getting some good
[SPEAKER_12]: results though lately you guys get great
results man i'm always blown away at what
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys are pulling off over there it's
uh it's like east coast cali over there
[SPEAKER_10]: well man brought a little bit of that back
actually and yeah but definitely started
[SPEAKER_10]: with the whole bubble hash thing oh geez
almost 20 years ago on the east coast you
[SPEAKER_10]: know so nice to be back here doing it
we've been getting a lot of good results
[SPEAKER_10]: with the with the cured resin dry flower
hole plant bubble runs and showing some of
[SPEAKER_10]: that work lately but um yeah i'm loving
the conversation about the cbd medicine
[SPEAKER_10]: and full specter medicine with other
plants definitely with the thc done some
[SPEAKER_10]: breeding of my own with some trying to go
turp forward put some turps on that cbd
[SPEAKER_10]: thc stuff i introduced a little bit of
pineapple fields actually and a few other
[SPEAKER_10]: different hoping for turpey types we work
with one actually out here called purple
[SPEAKER_10]: orange which is a calio back cross a calio
diesel back cross that i think came from
[SPEAKER_10]: dinofem overseas in europe and that one's
really loud turp forward super bright so i
[SPEAKER_10]: just want to throw that out there
definitely use a lot of cbd medicine and
[SPEAKER_10]: recommend it especially for us you know
heavy thc consumers seems to kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: flatten out the roller coaster with that
so yeah hey everyone what are you with the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole plant dried resin runs are you what
bags are you using um to catch the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: plant is it down to 40 oh that's funny so
we're we're actually well we're using the
[SPEAKER_10]: full bag set so we do six bag and then we
do a three wash series on the full bag we
[SPEAKER_10]: do what i've been calling kind of a micro
macro so we're like small batch we're kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of excited about it we've been doing this
for a couple years just for our own rhythm
[SPEAKER_10]: and it works really well we've kind of
dialed in for our i think a primary five
[SPEAKER_10]: ten fifteen minute wash consecutively with
the clean out between and you know fresh
[SPEAKER_10]: water ice input up to the last run then
kind of a clean out dump and we've been
[SPEAKER_10]: focusing on definitely for the whole for
the kind of broad spectrum 73 to 160 and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's been our best trap for for the
whole plan dried stuff but we're i'm
[SPEAKER_10]: finding that for the rosin press the 120
to 160 for the dry you know versus fresh
[SPEAKER_10]: frozen always love the nut the black by
the 90 to 120 black bag is like you know
[SPEAKER_10]: the baby but gooey turpy and the resin
both together but i'm finding for like the
[SPEAKER_10]: pristine lighter nature that maybe the
market demands a little bit in the new day
[SPEAKER_10]: for like the lighter look rosin that you
can still get from an air dry cured resin
[SPEAKER_10]: comes from that 120 to 160 locked in for
sure pick up i love it i love it and um
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah i mean and also have you are you
pressing have you pressed or made any hash
[SPEAKER_07]: from hemp or any kind of cvd stuff i i
know nick of tea and essential extracts
[SPEAKER_07]: was doing some cool stuff a long time ago
and i remember when i first smoked my
[SPEAKER_07]: first hemp like hash i was kind of like
trippy and it was weird when smokeable
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp took off to you were like whoa like
smokeable hemp is one of the number one
[SPEAKER_07]: products for hemp farms they know
originally you know maybe now but you know
[SPEAKER_07]: but still smokeable hemp was big but uh
any experience with making hash out of
[SPEAKER_10]: hemp yeah making some bubble hash out of
hemp we made some full spectrum from dried
[SPEAKER_10]: plant dried flower like a couple years ago
just found kind of on repeat um the yields
[SPEAKER_10]: were a little lower and such but they did
make a really goopy black tarry substance
[SPEAKER_10]: i can't remember if it was at the bottom
lower micron or higher set but it was not
[SPEAKER_10]: your average try you know 73 to 160 even
it was almost on the other side of that
[SPEAKER_10]: and with some i think the 73 to 90 maybe
that was kind of you know it was very
[SPEAKER_10]: black tarry it was tan and rich but had a
a tacky glue quality that just dense stuck
[SPEAKER_10]: together very heavy small dense you know
black dark right away and it had a bubble
[SPEAKER_10]: had a melt quality to it even you know
with heat but it was not not full melt it
[SPEAKER_10]: was perhaps not the best tasting had a
good heavy cvd effect um yeah but always
[SPEAKER_10]: on the search for new stuff i talked to
the ancient green friends last week that
[SPEAKER_10]: said they have something like a peach tree
or some other work from uh i think from a
[SPEAKER_10]: moon gazer or somebody any it's a peach
tree or something with some peach turps
[SPEAKER_10]: and i'm always kind of looking for the
like i said very turp forward or kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: cvd work we've been doing otherwise like a
super haze cut last year for the full just
[SPEAKER_10]: went full plant like you guys are talking
about into the extraction loop there for
[SPEAKER_10]: the feco for the you know for the ancient
greens processing and getting amazing
[SPEAKER_10]: healing results for a couple years between
elders in the community solving their pain
[SPEAKER_10]: to my dog showed my younger dog has lime
disease and i don't know i can't say that
[SPEAKER_10]: this is what helped or did it but we put
her on the antibiotic because her platelet
[SPEAKER_10]: count was so high at like a 171 where she
originally showed a 29 which was flagging
[SPEAKER_10]: for the for the lime at a young age six
months a year later she was 171 we did the
[SPEAKER_10]: regimen and i stuck her on this you know
with some other medicine here and there
[SPEAKER_10]: too a little bit for about a month at the
end before testing and she showed at about
[SPEAKER_10]: i think it was a 19 count like not even on
the char after a year of regimen every
[SPEAKER_10]: single day with that cvd formula you know
pretty heavy dosing honestly daily didn't
[SPEAKER_10]: skip a day my old dog with us lives by it
too and has the most high quality of life
[SPEAKER_10]: with it and anyway i wanted to throw that
in the pets are absolutely amazing i saw
[SPEAKER_10]: lime disease i believe is what kind of
kicked its butt you know what was the dose
[SPEAKER_10]: that you were giving it daily well i'd say
about a dropper full i don't know what
[SPEAKER_11]: that equivalates to it what is that like
so is that just is that neat oil or is
[SPEAKER_10]: that oil that's been diluted so i went
with a mct oil with um what i would say
[SPEAKER_10]: about a 2500 mil is what i make at home
for us you know honestly 25 to 3000 mil we
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of go strong it tastes it's rough you
know but what i would do is you know full
[SPEAKER_11]: drop or full two to three mil milligram
not not mil right just so i know milligram
[SPEAKER_10]: milligram yeah so like what a 2500 to 3000
milligram type of bottle size two ounce
[SPEAKER_10]: bottle in a one ounce yeah one ounce i
guess suspension is that an mct you're
[SPEAKER_10]: asking kind of the wrong person was a 31
ounce bottle you know i'm trying to get as
[SPEAKER_11]: much information on this because people do
this all the time i've never heard it for
[SPEAKER_11]: limes disease so like um i i think that
that's uh you know i mean again more
[SPEAKER_11]: things to look into i mean my gosh so like
what um do you notice so like three gram
[SPEAKER_10]: like like three grams of crude oil carbon
dioxide you know crude feco into one ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: of of mct oil that gives you a hundred
milligrams per milliliter okay okay yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: that's that's that's pretty concentrated
right yes i mean we go pretty strong
[SPEAKER_10]: that's i've i've went from about half of
that up and we i definitely make it pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: strong no no question it's very crude even
on the taste are you mixing this so what i
[SPEAKER_10]: do for my doggies with my doggies that at
dinnertime for them i will mix it up on
[SPEAKER_10]: their food and i give them a special gravy
from our own chicken bone stock at home
[SPEAKER_10]: that we make you know from the neighbors
chicken so we do it pretty right and a
[SPEAKER_10]: local protein source typically for them
reduced we refreeze it and break it out
[SPEAKER_10]: they get gravy every night on their dinner
and i'm able to mix it in with the warm
[SPEAKER_10]: you know a little warm water with the
gravy with the cvd and i just swirl it
[SPEAKER_10]: right up and they can't get enough my
older dog licks that medicine off the
[SPEAKER_10]: dropper she likes it she knows it heals
her and then i don't know this one either
[SPEAKER_10]: for sure but it's so exciting that she has
a skin cyst like a fatty tumor the older
[SPEAKER_10]: dog that comes up on her back for about
three years and when i apply that pure mct
[SPEAKER_10]: oil even right by the dropper a full
dropper full on it two to three days right
[SPEAKER_10]: into the tumor and that thing reduces by
like half to three quarter sides every
[SPEAKER_10]: time it's wild amazing right is fucking
amazing i love this conversation about
[SPEAKER_08]: unreal because our dogs have been our
patients like our dogs have been and our
[SPEAKER_08]: cats and our animals and then the
neighbor's horses and the neighbor's goats
[SPEAKER_08]: i've been using cannabis you know for 30
years to see you know how we can take them
[SPEAKER_08]: either out of a death situation or out of
acute different types of symptoms and um
[SPEAKER_08]: that super high concentrated cbd like
you're talking about like 100 milligrams
[SPEAKER_08]: per gram is what we're making here so each
capsule is worth about a gram give or take
[SPEAKER_08]: just a little bit in the way that we make
it so it's about 90 to 100 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_08]: capsule and our dogs will get a heaping
tablespoon in their food per day so
[SPEAKER_08]: they're eating about probably 2 000
milligrams of cbd per day um and i think
[SPEAKER_11]: it's it's amazing the changes have you
guys ever found where it makes the dog
[SPEAKER_11]: restless at night and like they sometimes
will be panting at night i mean i think
[SPEAKER_11]: that again that's one of our things about
giving super heroic doses we don't know if
[SPEAKER_11]: we're just overstimulating their
cannabinoid system i'm always worried
[SPEAKER_11]: about giving the dog too much cannabinoids
so now they're just all i think it depends
[SPEAKER_08]: on the age of the dogs and what the dogs
have as far as symptoms because i never
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah young dog that amount what i'm
talking about is our older dog i'm looking
[SPEAKER_08]: at him right here he's got tumors he's
over 14 i think he's 15 now sweetest thing
[SPEAKER_08]: but just you know keeping his you know
zest for life is all that's important and
[SPEAKER_08]: i just what i wanted to say in here was
that you can use yeah and and the thc
[SPEAKER_08]: needs to be incredibly low so that's why
those high concentrations of the hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: because i noticed if it's a high thc
they're affected oh yeah very quickly i
[SPEAKER_00]: know i know a veterinarian here in
northern california that's had a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs die from consuming edibles that were
high thc dogs have an insane number of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors in their cerebellum
and that will so thc affects them very
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly really be careful giving your dog
cannabis that has thc in it hey speaking
[SPEAKER_03]: of california hold on one second there is
an actual assembly bill 384 which would
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibit the border of this from
disciplining veterinarians who recommend
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on an animal for medical purposes
so in california ab 384 is the one you
[SPEAKER_03]: should be calling your representative and
your local people to make them aware so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know because we can't carry
products currently for animals because of
[SPEAKER_03]: this it is very much a challenge so this
will be a step toward normalization here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the state of california so ab 384 call
your people now thank you thank you you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't carry pet products atn it is a gray
area i mean people can choose to but the
[SPEAKER_03]: sboe i mean not the sb o bcc currently is
yeah they're kind of um it's it's it's one
[SPEAKER_03]: of those areas where we need a bill like
sb 384 for that type of protection uh
[SPEAKER_03]: again remember i can't carry cbd from hemp
i can carry cbd from thc plants so i can
[SPEAKER_03]: carry it from indica but not from sativa
so cbd is cbd is cbd but the law here is
[SPEAKER_03]: ignorant and dumb and we still have to
educate the ignorant and dumb because
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got ignorant and dumb laws like this
so you know i hear you are doing i think
[SPEAKER_11]: is that they can take metric tag material
and somehow add it to that hemp derived
[SPEAKER_11]: material and get it into the metric system
somehow through the back not in california
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's just not in california at this
time it would be illegal that's has a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it through the um i think there's a
there's an organization that that was set
[SPEAKER_01]: up for massachusetts so you can get it in
as an ingredient there's like a weird gray
[SPEAKER_01]: area there so that's the best that the
state's really done so it's kind of weird
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just you know because it's a
cannabinoid you know yeah i wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: you know josh kelly i've made some
three-to-one here rosin um from fresh rose
[SPEAKER_01]: and hemp that um well really a drug
cultivar but i've also been working with
[SPEAKER_01]: um lifter and hawaiian haze and a bunch of
other varietals and i'm trying to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding of like how it reacts
to different processes so i'll let you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys know how i get as i get deeper into
it i've got quite a bit to play with so
[SPEAKER_07]: that's awesome and those are generally
high protein plants i mean yeah you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow those i mean they they smell good
yeah lifter's super sour really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like got that nice like you know i have
some here you know it's nice and it's uh
[SPEAKER_01]: i'll let you guys know i mean it's it's
really sappy but this is this was really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful i mean the color is really nice
on it um you know it's just it's nice it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice floral um you know that one's from
electra so but it's um but each varietal
[SPEAKER_01]: is like is all over the place you know
i've had varieties that test really hot
[SPEAKER_01]: but then other ones that don't and when
you do these big mixed batches you just
[SPEAKER_01]: get a a cannabinoid ratio that's um that's
varying in different either or direction
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's pretty interesting i would love to
dig into why this group thinks different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars work differently in the
extraction process and part of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: driving this in my mind is in making feco
full extract oil of different cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things i've come to realize is
things that are predominantly thc at in
[SPEAKER_00]: feco don't flow well at all at room
temperature whereas things that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in cbd and low in thc do flow pretty
readily at room temperature and i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that terpenes probably play a part in that
but when i play with making hash because i
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy smoking hash one of the things i've
found is yeah as a general thing most thc
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars don't work up into a nice little
puck of hash as readily as things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in cbd so i think cannabinoids have
something to do with it but even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about like what's the difference
between i remember bubba kush was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that never worked into hash very
well whereas sour diesel for example you
[SPEAKER_00]: could work a nice little puck of hash of
that in your hands so what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference there is it can't be just
cannabinoids there's something else going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with the trichomes that gives us this
different response whether we're pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: or yeah you guys get the gist of my
question i'm wondering i'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_11]: well i would say it's a terpene he wants
to be a solid right are you are these in
[SPEAKER_11]: liquid are you talking about liquid
extract sam speak up you were a little low
[SPEAKER_06]: there i heard you i said i presume it's
mostly the terpenes yeah i concur with
[SPEAKER_01]: that i've seen um and i'm sure maybe
marcus could could share some of his
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences but um i think certain
varietals like a jack harraige is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like historic a low yielding varietal
because of the type of terpenes it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually produces um but also you know i
think we could even get more granular in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the type of trichome heads that
it grows as well but i'm leaning towards
[SPEAKER_07]: colin is the the trichome heads or
whenever you touch most of the hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: flowers they're they're really greasy you
know they're that same kind of jack
[SPEAKER_07]: harraige greasy right thing so i there's
something in the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid makeup and maybe that's why it
flows better it makes sense right like
[SPEAKER_07]: when you touch it it just greases out in
your hands that would make the the feco
[SPEAKER_07]: that you make more viscous and flow a
little bit better and i think the thc
[SPEAKER_07]: varietal can cbd has a larger head and a
bit of a different shape now that can be
[SPEAKER_07]: proven wrong i that's just observational
through growing and and making hash out of
[SPEAKER_07]: but that's my i think what did you have oh
i was just thinking yeah we're talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about when we talk about terpenes so just
talking about oils and then different
[SPEAKER_08]: viscosity levels for the oils with
different temperatures and how different
[SPEAKER_08]: temperatures grease out at different you
know volatile oils gotta be the terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah that's sorry i was just gonna add
that different cultivars all have
[SPEAKER_11]: different terpenes and different terpenes
have different saturates saturation points
[SPEAKER_11]: for thca and thca which is the predominant
cannabinoid that's in these kinds of
[SPEAKER_11]: varieties are is going to want to
crystallize out above its saturation point
[SPEAKER_11]: but just before its saturation point if
it's a super saturated solution it's going
[SPEAKER_11]: to be viscous yeah and the thing with with
it's i found an interesting way with with
[SPEAKER_11]: cbd so and again we're talking about thca
which wants to be a solid right thc is a
[SPEAKER_11]: is a is a liquid it's just a very very
very viscous liquid it's not quite a solid
[SPEAKER_11]: i mean you can freeze thc into a hard
pocket low temperatures but when you warm
[SPEAKER_11]: it up it becomes just an amorphous liquid
right so it's just basically the the
[SPEAKER_11]: difference in the viscosity might have to
do with how much if there is any
[SPEAKER_11]: adventitious decarboxylation in your
extraction process so that's what i was
[SPEAKER_11]: going to ask is in your in your process
itself is this after you've decarboxylated
[SPEAKER_00]: are you we try to do the extraction we do
the extraction itself in cold ethanol and
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't decarboxylate before we do it
because again if you're not if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for psychoactivity you would
decarboxylate but if you're trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine particularly for people who are
sensitive to thca you try and keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated or carboxylated you still
want what we found is and i don't know if
[SPEAKER_11]: you see this too colin in alcohol recovery
from an alcohol extraction that you get
[SPEAKER_11]: spontaneous decarboxylation of cbda and
cbda in solution cbda in solution is not
[SPEAKER_11]: stable and it readily decarboxylates and
so what we find is just that letting the
[SPEAKER_11]: crude sit will measure it and we'll see no
cbda at all however all the co2 that's
[SPEAKER_11]: been that's been lost through adventitious
decarboxylation is still dissolved in the
[SPEAKER_11]: crude itself because if you try to
dissolve that crude good luck because of
[SPEAKER_11]: that co2 in there you're going to be
messing with your vacuum constantly so you
[SPEAKER_11]: still have to somehow purge all of that
co2 out of your crude but what i find is
[SPEAKER_11]: that after that you have a very different
viscosity for a high cbd crude than you do
[SPEAKER_11]: for a high thc crude and i would just
attribute that again i think sam's right
[SPEAKER_11]: absolutely for the terpenes that's in
there but ultimately i mean those two
[SPEAKER_11]: compounds just have very different
characteristics all together i mean thc is
[SPEAKER_11]: just a viscous viscous honey-like syrupy
oil that again you can freeze into a solid
[SPEAKER_11]: below room temperature but for the most
part of room temperature it's just a
[SPEAKER_11]: viscous oil and the last other thing i was
just going to mention is that sometimes
[SPEAKER_11]: with thca when you get a saturated thca
solution it does get very very very
[SPEAKER_11]: viscous so i've seen some saps that are
almost solid but they're just still a
[SPEAKER_11]: runny liquid and it's because the terpenes
are doing a good job at keeping all that
[SPEAKER_11]: thca in solution and it's not kind of gone
above the thc saturation point but the
[SPEAKER_11]: fact that each individual strain is going
to have a different saturation point like
[SPEAKER_11]: what we have found is like with headband
in particular it makes a really good you
[SPEAKER_11]: know diamonds really good sauce but for
some reason some of those haze and again
[SPEAKER_11]: this has to do i guess with the fact that
they're high in the sesquiterpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: sesquiterpenes don't necessarily
volatilize away but they're still liquids
[SPEAKER_11]: and they solubilize all the cannabinoids
those strains tend to be more sauce-like
[SPEAKER_11]: tend to make a lot of a lot of sauces and
you could still get diamonds to partition
[SPEAKER_11]: out of those saturated solutions but it
might take a little bit longer on the
[SPEAKER_11]: shelf and also what you might find is that
if you're filling vape pen cartridges with
[SPEAKER_11]: those types of sauces early on you might
find after a few weeks you got a little
[SPEAKER_11]: crystals in your vape pen tank because
yeah the saturation has not fully or the
[SPEAKER_11]: crystallization hasn't hasn't fully
happened but um from my experimental
[SPEAKER_11]: results i think we have measured this
actually on three or four different ones
[SPEAKER_11]: it appears as though the thca uh
saturation point in things like i think we
[SPEAKER_11]: did for headband and i want to say we did
for lemon diesel was right around 86 or 87
[SPEAKER_11]: percent so if you exceed that in terms of
the amount of cannabinoids in there and
[SPEAKER_11]: you have less terpenes in there you're
going to start crashing things out but
[SPEAKER_11]: that's going to be very specific to the
cultivar and probably very specific to the
[SPEAKER_11]: way that that cultivar was grown and
probably more specific to how it was
[SPEAKER_11]: extracted and you know put into the jar
yeah i agree with you mark i think you
[SPEAKER_10]: were saying that hey colin yeah go ahead
have you been washing any have you have
[SPEAKER_01]: you been washing any hazes at all so yeah
so i've um you know i i've washed that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a lot of hazes in general uh just
because i like them i mean i i really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy them and um commercially they just
don't make sense like i've i've you know
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah on hill haze you know six over 16
weeks it just it's it's hard but um i
[SPEAKER_01]: think the closest thing commercially
viable just to like think you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: grows really well is like some of the
jack's cleaner lines um that if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find a good phenotype and chemotype there
it'll it definitely dumps and it makes six
[SPEAKER_01]: star like a beauty um but i think um i'm
trying to think of the name of the variety
[SPEAKER_01]: that i ran this past year that was like
super amazing but it just yielded like two
[SPEAKER_01]: percent and it was just like for the game
head stash at that point um but we did
[SPEAKER_01]: like yeah that's maybe like 100 pounds it
was really good though um but yeah i think
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for hazes for me um i try to look
towards things like that have been worked
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot you know like like that you know
like the jack's cleaner or or any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of variety or even the the um jack
frost from lupa that was one that i've
[SPEAKER_01]: i've ran that had like a pretty good yield
if i don't have my notes around me but i
[SPEAKER_01]: think that was another one that was good
um but yeah you know also brothers grim i
[SPEAKER_01]: you know rosetta stone was actually one
that i put out in massachusetts and people
[SPEAKER_01]: loved it because it just embodied the jack
harare but had this like floral ecuadorial
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe to it that was very different for the
northeast here like people just weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: next to um like they just weren't next to
the these varietals you know so to speak
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they they really didn't get into
this floral thing out here um very much
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they look at what california is
going through in terms of what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're kind of uh their favorite you know
songs of the week if you will and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a lot of those gelatos and the
sherbs and a lot of that stuff and out
[SPEAKER_01]: here as you know it's just traditionally
been sours and kems and you know and i
[SPEAKER_01]: really appreciate a lot of that rosetta
the rosetta specifically from rick was was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really great um uptown funk was
really great on the on the plant but
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't translate so well through the
process um c99 was another one that i felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like had that grapefruit funk to it that
kind of had ecuadorial a little bit of um
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah the super silver haze is one that i
used to grow a ton of man that was like my
[SPEAKER_01]: classic that's another one historically i
don't know sam maybe sam has some some
[SPEAKER_07]: more you know maybe from the perspective
of the super silver haze around here uh
[SPEAKER_07]: you know finishes pretty early like people
grow it outdoors here in british columbia
[SPEAKER_07]: so i'm imagining it's some hybrid version
of it i don't know if there's any thoughts
[SPEAKER_07]: on that but i'll also say arzelli's gift
was you know has the jacarer mother clone
[SPEAKER_07]: from eugene which is the jacarer's got
haze in it right i mean that's this one
[SPEAKER_07]: right here the jacarer's got haze and
skunk in it and i wish i could share this
[SPEAKER_07]: with you guys if somebody and uh then the
zellies gift has super lemon haze that we
[SPEAKER_07]: got from hawaii from the north shore of
kawaii so the zellies gift has a nice
[SPEAKER_07]: batch of super lemon haze and original
haze from jack and then the also the
[SPEAKER_07]: lemons and the turpinolines and stuff but
it is a greasy plant still our home but a
[SPEAKER_08]: bunch of people are washing it down in san
francisco and they're saying that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: their most favorite sort of creamy and
also it's mixed with the afghan goo so now
[SPEAKER_07]: we've got the goo in there i mean not now
it's been forever it's our oldest one but
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway i just like how the goo mixed with
the the lemony hazes um and it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: really good cash you gotta get you some
seeds we're seeing a popularity here in
[SPEAKER_03]: the bay area of the cake varieties and
cereal milks apparently those are
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently really popular between the
wedding cake birthday cake uh we're still
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing the hazes lemon jack gelatos you
know those are still you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: prevalence the kush the diesels but uh
yeah the cereal the the cereal milk and
[SPEAKER_03]: the uh the cake varietal seem to be uh the
the latest flavor du jour's what about the
[SPEAKER_07]: orangeade um and the uh those kind of
there's some pretty good uh still
[SPEAKER_07]: creamsicles and stuff going on still oh
yeah they're coming through as well but
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm just again the popularity with the the
consumers they seem to be what they seem
[SPEAKER_03]: to be gravitating toward it's always
fascinating as a cannabis soci you know
[SPEAKER_03]: sociologists have always been fascinated
by the trends as they've come through and
[SPEAKER_03]: as you know such as when we won the
cannabis cup for you know um uh you know
[SPEAKER_03]: girl scout cookies you know then
everything was cookies so it's just always
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating to watch the different flows
of you know genetics as they come through
[SPEAKER_03]: what stays and sticks in the uh in
society's mind and what goes the way of
[SPEAKER_03]: the dinosaur and we never see again so
those trends are just rather fascinating
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere from looking back on the old
thcmq or whatever that we used to look for
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual prices in high times you know
and they'd be like in your area there's
[SPEAKER_03]: kush available for this money you're like
nobody's got that fucking pot around here
[SPEAKER_03]: especially that kind of money but you know
so now we have actually dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know varietals that are going out via
metric but you know metrics one thing it's
[SPEAKER_03]: another thing to see what the trends
people are going by what's getting them
[SPEAKER_03]: high what phenotypes are you know actually
triggering people right now through the
[SPEAKER_03]: populace it's i don't know do y'all find
it as fascinating as me i i just you know
[SPEAKER_06]: happens just names in other words if you
don't have any jack harar because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what you want well some unscrupulous uh
dealers have been known to call uh
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they got jack harar oh that's a
thing and that's the also the very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting thing about this year's
emerald cup is that they're doing it by
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile not by names because we've
got terroir at you know uh depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: the name of the genetic etc etc so by
actually going with these profiles i think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be a new dimension a new
dementia but i think it's rather
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating than just you know the
standard names that are out there yep now
[SPEAKER_06]: i guess we just have to worry about
varieties from seed that have multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotypes in them with different terpene
profiles that's true man there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: that going on um it's really awesome that
you know have the the knowing of the
[SPEAKER_08]: general public and those different flavors
i find it totally fascinating atm and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: really different than the legacy market or
the traditional market you know where you
[SPEAKER_08]: were just selling pounds and it was just
decided upon you know the buyer and the
[SPEAKER_08]: buyer maybe in and his or her likes and
maybe that was it or what they felt like
[SPEAKER_08]: if they could sell to their next big buyer
so it wasn't at all about consumers so i
[SPEAKER_08]: just am so fascinated with what consumers
are interested in and it's interesting too
[SPEAKER_08]: if you study terpenes which i do and are
you vetting medicine and sort of ancient
[SPEAKER_08]: essences and flower essences um sort of
the signs of the time and maybe what's
[SPEAKER_08]: going on in the world or even seasonally
what people are more drawn to you know are
[SPEAKER_08]: they drawn to more brighter you know
terpene notes in the wintertime and more
[SPEAKER_08]: earthy tones when it's super hot and sunny
out i just think that that's just like
[SPEAKER_08]: incredibly fascinating and i think it
would be really fun to track in a wider
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment at some time hey josh one thing
i wanted to add on the haze that you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned afgui is um uh brian i had
really good luck with the afgui times old
[SPEAKER_01]: mendo haze i had i got a bunch of stuff
from um from gooey breeders that he he
[SPEAKER_01]: released i guess last year or something
like that or maybe a year before and i'd
[SPEAKER_01]: really good luck with that um particular
variety i think it really leaned on both
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom and dad there um and gave you know
a nice yield and and really gave that that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that haze vibe but um i'm not
really um i don't really know where old
[SPEAKER_01]: mendo haze comes from i don't know if uh
josh kelly or even sam if you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: that is um but it it seemed to actually
produce well and then blackjack has been
[SPEAKER_01]: historically one that not the best yield
but it peters on you know it's so it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be so great if you grow it really well um
but i really think you know the black
[SPEAKER_01]: domina in that one and the jack harrier
really kind of equally kind of throw out
[SPEAKER_01]: uh the parent stock it's kind of cool um
was the black part of that blackberry kush
[SPEAKER_01]: or no so i think black blackjack is the
black domina oh the black i think and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's times to um the jack harrier um i
don't know which way it was it was created
[SPEAKER_07]: i'm not sure yeah our biggest excitement
this year with jack is the rainbow jack
[SPEAKER_07]: that we got from heart rock mountain so
big up daniel to heart rock mountain and
[SPEAKER_07]: all the work that they're doing on
breeding as well as everyone else um but
[SPEAKER_07]: the the rainbow jack was really beautiful
it was a incredible purple purple urkel uh
[SPEAKER_07]: great i believe and i could be corrected
on this i think it's a granddaddy
[SPEAKER_07]: granddaddy purple urkel jack and it was a
really just a vigorous plant it had like
[SPEAKER_07]: the crazy thick leaves and the and the
purple stock but with red stripes up it so
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like purple with red and then when
the leaves came out it was like you know
[SPEAKER_07]: how the where the leaf hits the stem
there's like a hand you know where the
[SPEAKER_07]: veins pop out all of those were bright red
bright red underneath with a totally green
[SPEAKER_07]: leaf really beautiful really beautiful we
we had a lot of uh cross we did a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with that this year that's amazing
i i'd say talking about the blackberry i
[SPEAKER_01]: do remember when blackberry came out kind
of like a pop culture phenomenon it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just so unbelievable i i'd never seen that
electric purple but i'd seen some purple
[SPEAKER_01]: but that that was a very special purple at
the time so i'm pretty sure the
[SPEAKER_07]: pinkleberry from create green source
gardens has some of the blackberry kushed
[SPEAKER_07]: in there and it's an early finisher right
so a lot of people use the blackberry kush
[SPEAKER_07]: as as their early part of their genetics
and we were just working we were just
[SPEAKER_07]: working with some here from uh jordan of
the islands um they had a what was it the
[SPEAKER_07]: black dosi dough so it was a blackberry
kush dosi dough black dough lotto it was a
[SPEAKER_07]: black dosi dough gelato that's what it was
anyway it was it was really beautiful and
[SPEAKER_07]: it kind of did have that bready sort of
not cake because if cake is its own thing
[SPEAKER_07]: but it had that kind of sweet i guess it's
like a dessert ganja you know you'd almost
[SPEAKER_08]: say i can definitely say that back in the
day the blackberry kush was the most
[SPEAKER_08]: sought after um varietal so i'm going back
to maybe 92 no a little bit later than
[SPEAKER_08]: that 95 maybe and the blackberry kush it
was like the most sought after the highest
[SPEAKER_08]: price per per pound the one that had like
all of the different colors and all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: different smells and it was really cool
because oddly enough we would get a whole
[SPEAKER_08]: crop of that from an all-women collective
out in northern cali just all women
[SPEAKER_08]: growing up in the hills and they were the
ones that were really holding on to that
[SPEAKER_08]: blackberry kush and it was worth a lot out
in the east coast because nobody had seen
[SPEAKER_08]: those chirps or you know smelled those
chirps or seen like those colors in a
[SPEAKER_07]: plant before it's pretty exciting and
there i would also say that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of success out there with our lemon
meringue homesteader our lemon homesteader
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've been doing tara lee big up to
you she's been out there making some
[SPEAKER_07]: really beautiful hashes uh with our lemon
meringue homesteader as well um and also
[SPEAKER_07]: this tire fire so i mean the skunks are
amazing you know duke diamond incredible
[SPEAKER_07]: with the with the dominion seed company
and all of the the fire i don't i don't
[SPEAKER_07]: think the tire fires from duke but we've
just gotten so much the sis skunk and the
[SPEAKER_07]: ssc skunk the ssc skunk a lot of masks too
are you do you have the mass super skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: going on out there at all or yeah so i
have so i have um what's known as the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk and there's a lot of
controversy behind where that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: how that came about um you know i've had
that one for a while and um i know bode
[SPEAKER_01]: was working with it and he's kind of
feeling the same way where it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful variety but there's it feels
like just a a really great selection of
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk to me that maybe has just been
passed around the region of new england
[SPEAKER_01]: new york and and um pennsylvania and the
dmv area as well um because i know duke
[SPEAKER_01]: diamond's worked with it a bit um but it's
um that's what it feels like to me it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very garlicky but very skunky um has a
very skunky vibe to it it's it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: great i mean i don't want to just take
anything away from it but there's a there
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of i'm sure there's people in the
chat that are probably want to chime in on
[SPEAKER_01]: where it came from but it's um it's a
really great variety and it's it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: backbone of a lot of things that we know
of it's said to be you know one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of sour diesel um you know it's
it's definitely a unique one um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is a little unstable at times you
have to be very careful hey i just wanted
[SPEAKER_12]: to let everyone know i'm actually stepping
away can you guys hear me we can okay
[SPEAKER_12]: great yeah colin said he was gonna help uh
run the show so you guys can go for
[SPEAKER_12]: however long the flow takes you but my son
tanner has been like anxiously awaiting uh
[SPEAKER_12]: me so patiently for the last what seems
like about uh two or three hours now so i
[SPEAKER_12]: gotta go hang out i can hear him at my
door he's coming you ready to hang out
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy yeah buddy go be dad we love you we
appreciate you and thank you for giving us
[SPEAKER_07]: this platform that was a really nice show
and whistler marcus that you showed us in
[SPEAKER_07]: the trees so have fun with have fun yeah
that's the important thanks everybody yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you mark marcus so yeah we'll keep
this going um text me when you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it off colin peace out all right i
will um thank you marcus thank you yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks brother um so yeah i have a
question for you guys um maybe josh and
[SPEAKER_01]: kelly can ask what are you guys finding in
your region that really is um little
[SPEAKER_01]: effort with you know pest management and
um you know just you know general
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental things are you guys finding
some some certain varieties or things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gravitating more towards over the
years or are you guys still fresh on like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're still trying stuff or you guys have
any kind of um things that you guys look
[SPEAKER_07]: for so i wanted to invite kaia on here
maybe next time you know from pacific
[SPEAKER_07]: northwest roots um his alien og crosses
that he made with a coffee the coffee's
[SPEAKER_07]: been really good to us green source has
done really good with it down in southern
[SPEAKER_07]: oregon and it was one of one of the
varieties that i can think of just right
[SPEAKER_07]: off the top of my head that did really
unbelievable and just zero issues and and
[SPEAKER_07]: incredible flavors really bright alien um
flavors you know maybe it's an alien thing
[SPEAKER_08]: some of the other alien varieties i think
it might be an alien thing for sure and i
[SPEAKER_08]: think what josh is talking about too is
what we notice is that it's our varietal
[SPEAKER_08]: that do like totally amazing you know year
after year so we'll bring in a certain
[SPEAKER_08]: percentage of other varietals you know and
it really only maybe only two to three
[SPEAKER_08]: percent of those ones that we bring will
be vigorous that will carry on and maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: bring into our lineage and breed and i
think that those aliens were definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: really good but for us i think what is the
most vigorous are those is our mothership
[SPEAKER_08]: afgu what josh was saying before is so
that original it's a real afghan sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: father it's super rich it's incredibly
vigorous it has um candy cane stripes of
[SPEAKER_08]: purple up it and the leaf pattern is
specific you know to what we know and what
[SPEAKER_08]: um and please do well each thing that we
crawl into it's more resistant things uh
[SPEAKER_08]: and it has just a lot of cook counts so
that's another thing sorry we're on a
[SPEAKER_07]: liquid lens so you were uh we got to go
back add the glazed cherries that we've
[SPEAKER_07]: brought in into our uh world has been
really amazing yeah so resistant yeah
[SPEAKER_08]: totally amazing and what i can say is that
the terpene profiles that don't work with
[SPEAKER_08]: us are definitely any of the oranges or
the tangy or you know we've got a gorgeous
[SPEAKER_08]: african orange well it's a gorgeous flower
but i'm working so hard at it for any type
[SPEAKER_08]: of pest management because for some reason
we're in a non-agricultural area we only
[SPEAKER_08]: grow by seeds there's nothing around us
but we have you know hemp aphids we have
[SPEAKER_08]: bong aphids that continue to come back and
we're really watching closely and have
[SPEAKER_08]: been for many many years on what terpene
profiles that they're most interested in
[SPEAKER_08]: and so we're really trying to stay away
from those terpene profiles even though
[SPEAKER_08]: they're really amazing and we grow them
anyway and you know we just work at it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a long winded no that's awesome
that's super cool i so skunk man you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you've grown more cannabis than anyone in
this room combined what over the years
[SPEAKER_01]: have you seen from your experience for dry
sift that's that's like something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've you know i know skunk one's been
been the main squeeze as as it's proven to
[SPEAKER_01]: be for a lot of the things that i've made
i've come to found out that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one in everything that i've done you
know is there is that you know skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: to me is is really interesting because it
embodies such a hybrid you know what what
[SPEAKER_06]: do you think you know attributes to that
stuff well probably what i liked best
[SPEAKER_06]: about skunk number one for dry sifting is
it once you dried and aged and cured the
[SPEAKER_06]: buds for a couple of months then and so
that the resin is more like a raisin
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than a wet gooey grape the skunk is
very easy to work with because i mean what
[SPEAKER_06]: you need is number one a lot of dried
plant material for dry sifting i'm talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about and then number two what you need is
you have to have a lot of it so that you
[SPEAKER_06]: can experiment and understand all the
different techniques and what it means to
[SPEAKER_06]: do it it's it's kind of like johnny does
he he sits up there and tries to find new
[SPEAKER_06]: cool things to do constantly but if i
don't have true favorites i mean probably
[SPEAKER_06]: haze and skunk is is to the i love the
best but uh i mean whatever appeals to any
[SPEAKER_06]: one individual is good for them and uh any
terpene profile can be appealing to
[SPEAKER_06]: different people uh i i've seen stuff that
i made me gag but other people thought it
[SPEAKER_06]: had sort of an appealing smell so what is
reality sam you mentioned skunk and haze
[SPEAKER_06]: did you ever breed those together oh yeah
uh all the time and uh skunk uh times haze
[SPEAKER_06]: and haze time skunk i made them both
they're both very similar and very
[SPEAKER_06]: wonderful you can get one that are almost
hazy looking and smelling and tasting and
[SPEAKER_06]: effects but with a lot more uh muscle to
them meaning a bigger plant with bigger
[SPEAKER_06]: buds more skunky rather than uh hazy but
uh also too there i i did varieties with
[SPEAKER_06]: like some ties that i i had brought back
from thailand and they were times uh it
[SPEAKER_06]: was called funk it was tie hay skunk and
uh let me tell you people i i've seen
[SPEAKER_06]: people who still have those mother plants
and just swear by them so i mean i've
[SPEAKER_06]: created hundreds of varieties and uh i i
just hope that somebody enjoyed them
[SPEAKER_06]: because my focus was primarily
recreational even though we did a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: medical work uh first uh we were really
trying to understand cannabis as deep as
[SPEAKER_06]: possible so that we could make better herb
and resin for the folks or allow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: make their own yeah and you you know you
definitely touched everyone with all your
[SPEAKER_01]: work i mean i i love the contrast with you
know with josh and kelly you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for your region for what works
for you guys and and sam you've you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been in a lot of different regions and
different scenarios as well um it's cool
[SPEAKER_01]: you know i i'm in a in a situation where
i'm in all these different environments
[SPEAKER_01]: and i'm trying to learn as much as i can
because it's like you know we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated side then we have the personal
side and you know there there's sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: very separate spaces you know um when you
want to breed towards selective things
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't really aren't towards the end
of like a you know an eight table room
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 2500 square feet or or a field you
know that that's going to end up in
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's bowl so you know it's it's cool
to hear the the contrast i i remember
[SPEAKER_06]: growing imported seeds from afghanistan i
did this many different times from many
[SPEAKER_06]: different imports of of seeds from
afghanistan uh because after i went there
[SPEAKER_06]: when i was very young uh it wasn't really
possible to go to afghanistan safely maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: a few people have done it recently but uh
yeah i mean if they want to kidnap a
[SPEAKER_06]: foreigner and hold them for ransom or
something there's to me that's not a
[SPEAKER_07]: vacation there's some good traveling going
on ear-raising online on ig has been doing
[SPEAKER_07]: some incredible travels um you know a good
amount of people and friends involved in
[SPEAKER_07]: their himalayan connection online um she's
been doing some really you know amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: travels and collecting a lot of strains um
illegal to go to a third world country and
[SPEAKER_06]: collect their genetics and bring them back
to america you have to now do it it's
[SPEAKER_06]: there's united nations of biodiversity
laws against doing that now hey sam sam we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a question from uh the group uh do
you have any information about the mid
[SPEAKER_06]: late 70s fallbrook red hair uh no i mean
but uh i don't know who is growing in
[SPEAKER_06]: fallbrook in the 70s that was out near the
avocado growers uh i imagine a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: different people and uh i'm not sure what
the red hair was i i wasn't down there in
[SPEAKER_06]: the 70s i was up in central california on
the coast but uh uh yeah fallbrook was one
[SPEAKER_06]: of the first places where they were able
to success fully grow later season sativas
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor the other question is did you work
with the ssscc bank i i gave them most of
[SPEAKER_06]: my well they bought most of my varieties
uh you know around the same time as
[SPEAKER_06]: neville so that was to been like you know
85 86 87 it's uh they got skunk haze and a
[SPEAKER_07]: dozen other varieties that i had and uh
mccallister have strains in there too at
[SPEAKER_06]: the time well greg had his strains being
sold by uh uh neville at cannabis castle
[SPEAKER_06]: but i'm not so sure about uh sssc i i
never saw his strains listed in there but
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe he did and i i just wasn't paying
attention hey sam i'm curious who did the
[SPEAKER_13]: northern light number five skunk haze 91
okay but what about it i don't know where
[SPEAKER_13]: it came from it's just a bag c that i had
marked on a bag and i actually got my mail
[SPEAKER_13]: from that 12 years ago that's i've been
playing i played with and i'm just curious
[SPEAKER_13]: i'm just trying to find like where's where
that seed bank came from or who actually
[SPEAKER_13]: created that that line say say it again
northern light number five skunk haze i
[SPEAKER_06]: think yeah well i i i was behind most of
the skunk hazes yeah i didn't i didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: hardly work with northern lights at all so
uh but somebody probably got a skunk haze
[SPEAKER_06]: uh either me or via via me and uh then
cross at times northern lights himself and
[SPEAKER_06]: what he got would have been something a
bit like silver haze so mr bob hebb hill
[SPEAKER_07]: in northern california and darcy there
that and that family um crickets and
[SPEAKER_07]: staccata seeds amazing family they've got
a lot of those original um probably the
[SPEAKER_07]: largest collections of origin mother
clones and mother plants and stuff and one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the interesting varieties out from them
uh on this thread of the 88 crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: red-haired interesting variety and it made
a flower that was probably unlike any
[SPEAKER_07]: other flower that we've had on our
property before which was super fat airy
[SPEAKER_07]: no like sun leaves to trim off or anything
weird orange long hairs and really kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: airy dense with crystals but not solid so
it was like it was hard to explain but
[SPEAKER_07]: that crystal no carbon oh yeah kelly's
saying all crystal no carbon so anyway the
[SPEAKER_07]: 88 g13 hash plant super good crickets and
staccata seeds mr bob hebb hill check them
[SPEAKER_03]: out did you have anything to do with the
freeze land f r i e s l a n d sam well
[SPEAKER_06]: freesland was uh uh one of the varieties
along with purple pars which was popular
[SPEAKER_06]: here in the netherlands when i first
visited in 1984 and uh it's still grown a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit but uh it wasn't um it's sorry
we do still actually from maine we got it
[SPEAKER_07]: at the regenerative conference it's a gg4
freesland cross and we also have a
[SPEAKER_06]: freesland cross and i forget the breeder's
name is wait wait you're saying it's gg4
[SPEAKER_06]: times freesland cross so that's gorilla
glue yes definitely is i'm saying we have
[SPEAKER_07]: more than one seed like packet of it one
of them is all freesland the other one is
[SPEAKER_07]: him trying to work it into the gg4 and
make it finish early so am i right to say
[SPEAKER_06]: the freesland finishes early yeah
freesland finishes fairly early it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: not really high in thc or crystals but uh
you know it's what people were using here
[SPEAKER_06]: in holland outdoors uh before the mid 80s
did you breed with it or modify it in any
[SPEAKER_06]: way no i tried to grow it i grew it in at
my greenhouse in california and i didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: like it so uh you know i i just i think i
threw the seeds away to be honest what did
[SPEAKER_03]: you not like about it the high the vigor
the size the growth yeah to me uh i really
[SPEAKER_06]: really wanted plants that were uh you know
the elite version of whatever arch type
[SPEAKER_06]: they are if it was mexican or columbian or
thai or or whatever and the freesland to
[SPEAKER_06]: me uh yeah it was it was what i used to
call ropa dope yeah it had thc but it it
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't screaming high now i'm not saying
that all freeslands are that way but uh
[SPEAKER_06]: but vast majority because i got them from
many different dutch sources and i took
[SPEAKER_06]: samples from their plants and none of them
were screaming high in thc i i'm not sure
[SPEAKER_06]: if i ever saw one more than 10 percent but
whatever uh and i didn't particularly like
[SPEAKER_06]: the taste or the smell or the aroma or the
effects uh screaming high so uh yeah it
[SPEAKER_07]: just felt a bit of a wayside for me so is
freesland part of ukraine is that a you
[SPEAKER_06]: know freesland is in the netherlands it's
up in the netherlands yes you can still
[SPEAKER_01]: get some freesland seeds from the real
seed co they're still offering there you
[SPEAKER_06]: go if if it's anything like it was i have
no idea i have some of the seeds i haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: had a chance to go through them i i was
they were also sold by lowland seed
[SPEAKER_06]: company one of the early dutch ones and dr
veed the uh uh the a woman who sold seeds
[SPEAKER_07]: in the netherlands in the mid 80s so i
remember the name of the seed bank was the
[SPEAKER_07]: clone only seed bank and that was his
thing like funny you know name i i don't
[SPEAKER_07]: get it will you explain it to me i'll let
him explain it to you but the clone only
[SPEAKER_07]: seed bank is in maine and he's a really
awesome guy so we got those freesland we
[SPEAKER_07]: really liked the cross with the gg for
this time so um it was something that we
[SPEAKER_07]: were going to continue with and we got
seeds from it and it did add a nice flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: to it and maybe on its own the freesland
like uh f2 or whatever that we got the
[SPEAKER_01]: double freesland cross you're freezing up
i think we lost them you'll see a phrase
[SPEAKER_07]: freesland hey i have another question for
sam now as flavorful so you know obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: we do but for the turf hey sam i have a
question from uh again from the chat i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna say this probably terribly wrong
have you grown the purple while in
[SPEAKER_03]: california in the 70s there you go yeah
yeah yeah i'm familiar with purple yes
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a mexican variety which i think is
gone now because all the mexican land
[SPEAKER_06]: races got hybridized with northern
american varieties that smugglers and
[SPEAKER_06]: do-gooders uh took down there to where
there are no pure mexican land races
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore including zhuatanejo purple or uh
acapulco gold is probably now probably got
[SPEAKER_07]: tie blood in it or lao blood who knows we
really enjoyed our acapulco gold that we
[SPEAKER_07]: grew out from bode seeds um it was
definitely you know looked a lot like a
[SPEAKER_07]: wild you know varietal and i do understand
totally what you're saying you know it's
[SPEAKER_07]: hard hard to get that we we just recently
got given seeds from the columbia from
[SPEAKER_07]: columbia in the 70s or was it early 70s
yeah we got like super old seeds so we're
[SPEAKER_07]: waiting on how to propagate those proper
and we're not we might do that this spring
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah every once in a while a person
comes out of the woodworks with old seeds
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff from afghanistan and and even
out of out of mexico but it is extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: rare but i i do like the acapulco gold
flavor and that lemony flavor and we just
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked some congo and you know there's a
lot of you know the interesting congo
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that are going around and that's
also got a nice i felt like a similar
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor to the acapulco gold but um i don't
know if anyone has any thoughts on that we
[SPEAKER_07]: have to duck out our internet's going out
and it's um you know just a beautiful day
[SPEAKER_07]: so i thank you so much for your time
everyone we love you see you guys keep
[SPEAKER_13]: growing lessons bye josh bye kelly hash
strains isn't that what we're all chasing
[SPEAKER_01]: those strains that make that epic hash so
it's um well what we have to do is we have
[SPEAKER_06]: to breed hashish varieties that have resin
the size of grapes so you can just freeze
[SPEAKER_06]: it so it's hard for shake it and uh you
know a single resin will fill many pipes i
[SPEAKER_04]: want it i crave it come on you botanist
you crazy botanist up there i'm gonna jump
[SPEAKER_04]: to folks have a great super bowl see
you're smiling we'll see you next week you
[SPEAKER_04]: mean the superb owl right join us
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i find you know the varietals that
work for me have obviously the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: largest heads but um it also depends on
what you're trying to do with the material
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're trying to get full melt heads
then you know you're going to want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really gentle and you need those larger
heads if you're going to try to make you
[SPEAKER_01]: know an edible or a tincture you could
probably wash for a really long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: get a much larger yield and knock some of
those heads that otherwise would never
[SPEAKER_03]: come off i was just imagining what those
actual plants would look like that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have great size can you imagine
the size of actual plant yeah i mean come
[SPEAKER_06]: on san we got to get you out of retirement
man well i have the vision i just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have the willpower anymore i was told that
one of those uh old uh you know wives
[SPEAKER_03]: tales you hear in your smoking circles is
that you can accomplish that if there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular growth cycle during the plant
and you graft them together at this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular day in the growth cycle then
you could actually double the thc of your
[SPEAKER_06]: plant i was like good luck with that i i
wish them all the best they're gonna need
[SPEAKER_01]: help though yeah a lot yeah i mean oregon
cbd is doing things at scale i'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what they do with drug cultivars if
they start start doing more with that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had some uh some breakthroughs in
terms of uh the things that they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding on the hem at least on the hemp
side basically a lot of the work you have
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing uh sam i mean single
cannabinoid you know seth is a friend uh
[SPEAKER_06]: he invited me several times up to visit
them up in oregon but uh the whole coven
[SPEAKER_06]: thing is sort of not i i would have
already been up there just to see what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're up to but uh yeah no i i think
it's great that people are picking up uh
[SPEAKER_06]: uh ideas that i first exploited 20 years
ago and uh running further with them i i
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's wonderful i stood on the back
of giants and uh if they want to put one
[SPEAKER_06]: foot up on one of my shoulders i'm happy
that they're doing hey sam so you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you've made more than your share of
mistakes going through and doing this and
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as your successes what would you
tell these people to avoid do doing so
[SPEAKER_03]: that they could save themselves a little
bit of time and mistakes along the way uh
[SPEAKER_06]: well it might be as simple as don't do
things that don't feel right in in your
[SPEAKER_06]: heart i mean really go after your dreams
don't you know do stuff you don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: do it's really almost that simple do what
feels right i i know that you've had to
[SPEAKER_06]: listen to that and i'm sure you've had
many offers of nefarious uh uh individuals
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to suck you into their uh black
hole but uh you know it's just because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's an easy way to make money doesn't
mean it's a good thing oh yeah and being
[SPEAKER_03]: that litmus of um integrity as well as
honesty is why we have to educate
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves as best as possible so that we
can know the bullshit so we can see
[SPEAKER_03]: through it so we can call it out which i
know i you know you do so effectively
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know from the experience that
you've been through and done so
[SPEAKER_06]: i i hardly have an answer it's uh yeah i
mean anybody who's been in this business
[SPEAKER_06]: very long has seen uh double dealing
bullshit talking you know people it's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: the nature of the game it's kind of like a
candle and all the moths are drawn to it
[SPEAKER_06]: but both good and bad moths but there's
lots of moths out there oh yeah i have had
[SPEAKER_03]: the dea actually serve me warrant at my
dispenser don't recommend it's not very
[SPEAKER_03]: fun but you know that's you know when
you're when you're doing this it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna get all kinds yeah true story
well said sam very well said i think my
[SPEAKER_13]: plants are calling for me and uh i'd love
to talk to you sam about about light about
[SPEAKER_13]: leds about about hps lighting and just a
new technology that is really changing the
[SPEAKER_13]: game in the gardens that we're seeing and
any thoughts on on that i have a question
[SPEAKER_06]: people who use led lights or do they find
that they're better for veg because i've i
[SPEAKER_06]: i've seen veg use and i agree they they're
dynamite but for flowering do people think
[SPEAKER_06]: that they're truly the best source or just
cheaper or better like lumens or or not
[SPEAKER_06]: lumens uh wavelengths who really thinks
that leds are better than other systems
[SPEAKER_06]: and they have the experience to know the
difference um i will raise my hand here
[SPEAKER_03]: because my company is using fluent uh leds
in nevada i have grown in uh various
[SPEAKER_03]: lights etc uh it is definitely cheaper um
it was definitely it had its own overall
[SPEAKER_03]: cost but uh due to uh you know heat issues
that you have being in nevada especially
[SPEAKER_03]: during the oh spring to fall uh you know
heats a huge issue for us so uh we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: able to uh supply our demand and we've
been in action for a few years but you
[SPEAKER_03]: know we're not huge we're not large and it
works for us the initial thought was to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to stack um and have more lights
inside which is why we went leds there but
[SPEAKER_03]: again just due to availability of size we
can't grow outdoors in nevada in the
[SPEAKER_03]: desert it's just impossible whereas here
in central valent california that's
[SPEAKER_03]: different so for us it was a uh it was
multiple decisions in arriving at that and
[SPEAKER_03]: i've went and i also toured multiple
facilities including uh up in alaska i saw
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple growers uh and i've been in
multiple gardens and they use fluent
[SPEAKER_03]: lights which is why i decided to go with
them in the end they seem to uh to work as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as i have not i don't have a facility
built out currently in nevada sam so i can
[SPEAKER_03]: say you know here's uh you know uh metal
highlight or hps versus uh my fluence i
[SPEAKER_03]: started there because i had to make a
decision because of the factory that's
[SPEAKER_03]: there and it has been beneficial and has
been working for us so do you see any
[SPEAKER_06]: differences in yield or quality i could
probably get a better yield a little
[SPEAKER_03]: better quality is my assumption if i had
you know different lights but we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: very pleased and happy with the product
and the flowers that have been coming
[SPEAKER_03]: forward but again i don't that's just my
own previous growing experience from
[SPEAKER_03]: working with ed rosenthal and others
because i grew under various lights in
[SPEAKER_03]: very different experimental situations
from growing in socks to growing in
[SPEAKER_03]: soilist to growing in soil to living soil
versus potted soil so i have a bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience but again here it was you know
hydroponic and uh going in with uh these
[SPEAKER_03]: lights because of what the dictation of
the laws as well as the region i was
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in so i wouldn't do that here in
california but there in nevada it made
[SPEAKER_06]: sense and dollars yes yes well more and
more people tell me that uh led is as good
[SPEAKER_06]: or better some say than high pressure
sodium or metal halide so but that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: i was curious about yeah in all all of
those settings i actually had a facility
[SPEAKER_01]: where we had led in two rooms we had a
mixed spectrum in a room and then the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: were all all um hps and i found that
certain varieties performed better under
[SPEAKER_01]: certain light light spectrums and certain
light intensities and also daily light
[SPEAKER_01]: intervals but you know i was getting you
know in terms of sheer sheer yield like i
[SPEAKER_01]: was still hitting we like we ended up
hitting around three pounds per light on
[SPEAKER_01]: leds so it performs you know and the resin
is really good because you can really dial
[SPEAKER_01]: it in but i think it it goes back to what
type of light you're using and how well
[SPEAKER_01]: that's built and not every manufacturer
makes the same you know you know they just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't make the same lights so i think that
is also a factor when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: led you know i i like fluent a lot i think
fluent is really great i think they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice line of light so they're
they've really thought about you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: it means to be you know as an led
manufacturer in the cannabis space so i
[SPEAKER_01]: really like what they're doing um but
there's also other manufacturers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing awesome stuff too um i know that
johnny b is working with some some people
[SPEAKER_01]: up in canada that are also doing some
great stuff so my experience is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it it has a lot to do with your growing
style it has a lot to do with the varietal
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're you're growing with um and
then of course your environmental controls
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're they're really awesome sam i
think the resin is is is impressive yeah i
[SPEAKER_13]: was gonna say i've been looking at the led
lights now for over a year i started
[SPEAKER_13]: growing with led lights with spectrum king
led in the very beginning and i saw that
[SPEAKER_13]: difference right away with the resin for
first balance that's why i really like
[SPEAKER_13]: leds was just specifically for the resin
but as as i really started looking at all
[SPEAKER_13]: the different spectrums and like i say now
it's kind of like what car do you want to
[SPEAKER_13]: drive and where are you going to park it
because there's 256 led companies that are
[SPEAKER_13]: dlc listed as of last week so there's this
is like the next green rush for the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis industry really it is is leds a
for one they're more efficient they're
[SPEAKER_13]: growing better resin uh we're getting
better uh air control because we're not
[SPEAKER_13]: dumping with ac units and and all this but
there is definitely a big rush with led
[SPEAKER_13]: and i'm kind of looking more towards those
uh you know those 16 18 week sativas and
[SPEAKER_13]: what spectrum they're growing under and
seeing what they can do with that with
[SPEAKER_13]: leds but uh with the far red that's what
i've been testing with the alias led um i
[SPEAKER_13]: think everybody's been seeing my instagram
what i've been doing i've seen such i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: it's probably the best crop i've ever
grown right now is growing with leds and
[SPEAKER_13]: really learning dpd ppfd dli dialing in
those numbers and um wow i'm just seeing
[SPEAKER_13]: johnny yes do you ever grow with sunshine
i have but you know what um back in the
[SPEAKER_13]: days i used to do a lot of little
gardening because that's how we used to do
[SPEAKER_13]: everything was out in the bushes like oh
sir here and there like where i used to
[SPEAKER_13]: live um and those are always like the
blueberries or or a greenhouse with
[SPEAKER_13]: sunshine not a greenhouse me specifically
i've been growing indoors for 15 20 years
[SPEAKER_06]: probably 15 years well the sun is an
amazing source of light yeah but nothing
[SPEAKER_13]: finishes here in my backyard that well
just because of pacific northwest i've
[SPEAKER_13]: always had problems with the outdoors um
definitely seeing the difference between
[SPEAKER_13]: going from hps to leds was a difference
and recently i was in a place where
[SPEAKER_13]: someone was vegging with a gavita dual end
and beside that they had an led light and
[SPEAKER_13]: directly underneath the plants directly
underneath the uh the dual and gavita were
[SPEAKER_13]: actually stretching towards the led light
so i was just smiling because i was like
[SPEAKER_13]: that's just just that's that's the
difference that we're seeing right now and
[SPEAKER_13]: uh outdoor resin i like um but indoor
resins always been my go-to just because
[SPEAKER_06]: of where i am in the in the world yeah but
the way you can use a greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_06]: canada is with a darkening system that way
you use the sun but you darken it and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can finish your crop before it gets too
cold yeah i was just recently was just at
[SPEAKER_13]: a greenhouse in roberts creek that was
state of the art and i was testing its uh
[SPEAKER_13]: their lights and they had these lights
from nasa and uh didn't have a darkening
[SPEAKER_13]: system it had a whole darkening system on
the inside that's what you need you try
[SPEAKER_13]: one of those and you might really like it
yeah i'm definitely going up there and
[SPEAKER_13]: looking at this over the next like year
like i'm i mean i'll be going up every
[SPEAKER_13]: month every couple weeks to look at this
greenhouse all living soils i stepped on
[SPEAKER_13]: the betty freak i was like what are you
doing that's all living so i can't wait to
[SPEAKER_13]: see what they're growing there and they're
going to be growing sativas so i'm really
[SPEAKER_13]: looking forward to seeing outdoor grown um
properly run um strains yeah i've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing stuff here in northern california
i've grown outdoors in southern california
[SPEAKER_03]: and northern california both great
environments phenomenal of course uh
[SPEAKER_03]: southern california i got hit with those
damn moths that ladies little caterpillars
[SPEAKER_03]: way at the base of your plant and i i was
sitting on my deck one day and i was like
[SPEAKER_03]: why is this my top bud moving around and
all of a sudden out pops a little
[SPEAKER_03]: caterpillar head i was like oh yeah right
that's probably outdoors damn it yeah i
[SPEAKER_01]: think the light depth's come a long way
man i'm i'm working on a hybrid greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: that incorporates pretty much everything
for a year-round setting and um some
[SPEAKER_01]: really tight air exchanges for going
through HEPA filters and i'm really i
[SPEAKER_01]: really love where you know things are
headed with greenhouse in the capabilities
[SPEAKER_01]: for for what we're we're trying to do at
least so it feels like it's come a long
[SPEAKER_01]: way and i mean sam i don't you know at the
same time it feels like not much has
[SPEAKER_01]: changed but um you know i think the
systems themselves are amazing like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty incredible what's out there
right now between ggs and nexus nexus
[SPEAKER_06]: systems and i i i go to the uh
agricultural greenhouse uh show here in
[SPEAKER_06]: the netherlands every year it's the
world's biggest yeah and uh but this year
[SPEAKER_06]: they cancelled it because of covid but uh
i i see all the latest state-of-the-art uh
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and cannabis growers openly sell and
advertise there now because it's accepted
[SPEAKER_06]: it's legal for medical uses at least in
most countries so the world is changing
[SPEAKER_01]: step by step yeah yeah we just need
fertigation to catch up so we can get away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cut flower industry still stuck
on venturi systems so it just drives me
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy because we want to be efficient but
we also want to use inputs that go beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: the capabilities of these systems and it
becomes difficult um especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use organic inputs it's like
nearly impossible and sometimes especially
[SPEAKER_01]: drip irrigation it becomes a battle and
then now you know malnutrition happens and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just trying to you know it's just
the mission it's the mechanics you know it
[SPEAKER_06]: has nothing to do with your your your
skill sets you to focus on the problems or
[SPEAKER_06]: you can focus on the solutions because
i've never seen a problem that you
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't find a solution for to be honest
i agree that was one thing that they
[SPEAKER_03]: always taught us in the military is don't
present a problem without a solution you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it forces you to think so my solution
is we need we we needed um we need more
[SPEAKER_01]: sophistication in terms of our our
injection injection systems and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to replace them with um a very simple
setup that's based on on pumps that are
[SPEAKER_01]: that are not these venturis i think it's a
very simple fix it's just doing it which
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm in the middle of so i'll let you know
when i when i get there about to say if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not if you don't know what is then
create it so and create it no doubt wade
[SPEAKER_01]: are you are what are you up to with uh
with all the things that you're doing are
[SPEAKER_01]: you are you using um drip irrigation like
how are you guys managing a lot of your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff well um because of the way the
california market works i don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis activity allowed on my
farm so i have personal use grow which i
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm in the ground and i give them water
when they need it we have abundant
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful water here on the property and i
always found when i was working indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: that yeah irrigation was an interesting
problem to sort out with organic nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really a challenge it's part of why i
really enjoy working outdoors in the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah sam is totally right the best
light you can get is the sun and it's free
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of that being said yeah i'm still
doing uh what i think of as compassion
[SPEAKER_00]: work i just last night had a pretty
depressing conversation with actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first family that i contacted where
there was a catastrophic situation going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and their son just got out of the
hospital from a septic infection bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: infection it wasn't clear it's still not
clear how he contracted the infection but
[SPEAKER_00]: while he was in the hospital they put him
back on some of these anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: medications and so i was talking with mom
about that and suggesting that she that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would try and find some cbg and some and
i'm going to see about getting her set up
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to juice some fresh cannabis
plants to see if that doesn't help him
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize because of the acid forms that
are found in fresh juice but the real
[SPEAKER_00]: focus of my time these days is about
education i've entered into a contract
[SPEAKER_00]: with a local dispensary and have created
an education program for their wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: associates as i call them and uh and a
whole nother line of uh classes if you
[SPEAKER_00]: will for the public uh because i've
realized that most most folks who know
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis what they know about it is it
gets just on and they don't know much more
[SPEAKER_00]: about it but they've heard there's other
benefits available and so the focus there
[SPEAKER_00]: is just on educating how cannabis products
work in the body how that system the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system functions and then
how to relate to the products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the california space and uh
you've heard me say it before you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about legalization here in California
really what we have is heavily regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization as versus legalization
overregulated overregulated thank you at
[SPEAKER_00]: john of course anyway what one of the few
benefits of what's happened is the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are available in
dispensaries right now are among the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest of any contaminants free they are
exactly what they say they are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging too much packaging don't even
get me started but yeah there's products
[SPEAKER_00]: that are actually really what they say
they are available on the shelf for a
[SPEAKER_00]: price and so that's a benefit and yet most
people most consumers don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to how those products work
in their bodies and how to use them how to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the dose that works for them how to
find the product or the way of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that chemistry into their bodies so that's
you know two minutes of uh so far we've
[SPEAKER_00]: created about 20 hours of video content of
conversation me doing presentations and
[SPEAKER_00]: just yesterday we had our first live class
with uh we did a zoom with the i think
[SPEAKER_00]: some people showed up and yeah it was on
the basics of cannabis and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of cannabis use and how it
came to be recognized as medicine and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a skim through the
endocannabinoid system and how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to the ecs and then something
about how products work in the body you
[SPEAKER_00]: know all of that in 40 minutes so there's
more to come and i'm really excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: it because our agreement with the
dispensary is house of harlequin owns all
[SPEAKER_00]: this content and i'm looking forward to
the opportunity to create more content and
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with a wider range of folks
because i think there's a real need for
[SPEAKER_00]: people i mean we there's all kinds of
information out there about how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your own there's information about how to
do extractions and whatnot but there's and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of information for health
care professionals you know if you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk the language of research and science
there's a bunch of good information coming
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly about cannabis but there's
not really much for the consumer the
[SPEAKER_00]: person who actually doesn't know much
about cannabis and would like to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the potential benefit so that's
what i've been doing lately and uh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm going to be putting out uh once we get
this program with the dispenser we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with now 2477 in nevada city is
the folks doing that daniel bachelor good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and uh he he came he's one of the
first folks he was first recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis by his doctor at the age of 15 up
here in uh dr uh todd i think was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first guy who was willing to recommend
cannabis for his adhd and i'm probably
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing more under hipper than i should
but that being said yeah daniel's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: guy and um and yeah he was open to the
idea of me continuing to own the content
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're creating and uh i'm really
looking forward to how this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: play out over the next year or two uh
because yeah there'll be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities there so that's what i've
been up to um and i'm excited about it you
[SPEAKER_01]: can probably tell amazing that's awesome
yeah wade that you know you've been been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this a long time and you know i
think what you're touching on is is what
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone always asks you know at the
retail level at least you know they just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to know more you know from a consumer
point of view and you know there's got to
[SPEAKER_01]: be people like yourselves and all everyone
here as well that needs to share this
[SPEAKER_01]: information it's really cool that you're
bringing it to a centralized place and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it allows people to actually have a
place to go and say hey i can reference
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing that wade said and keep going
back to it because i think sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: information gets lost in the ether as you
get new information and there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: new information today that doesn't really
have a place that it sits on these social
[SPEAKER_01]: forums or these social platforms that gets
lost and you really have to dig for them
[SPEAKER_01]: and in providing that that home for it's
going to be really cool that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a really it's a really noble thing
you're doing well uh you know we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about clubhouse here a bit it's
one of the things that my team is asking
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do and i'm still trying to get my
head around it is creating a room um to uh
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about cannabis and the consumer
products that are available and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis chemistry uh how it affects our
bodies how it works in our bodies and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my uh one of my tag lines if you
will is uh in the context of this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation psychoactivity is a side
effect of cannabis medicine it's one that
[SPEAKER_00]: i enjoy very much and for many people it's
the only reason they use cannabis but in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact in the effects that cannabis can
have in our bodies thc and the not thc
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me psychoactivity which isn't one
of the effects of thc is a side effect
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be mitigated by dose by a method
of getting that chemistry into your body
[SPEAKER_00]: by how frequently you take that that
preparation and what the needs of your
[SPEAKER_00]: body are as jan pointed out i think in one
of the chat rooms or maybe it was here on
[SPEAKER_00]: hash church that every person is unique
their needs are unique and their response
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cannabis chemistry is unique so
part of it is educating people so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: find the sweet spot for their needs and
the sweet spot for me is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the benefit you want without it
while still being able to go about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to do in your life um so and
on that note yeah i think i i gotta be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next person to jump out of this beautiful
conversation i am stunned to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to sit with this particular
group of people i uh yeah uh much respect
[SPEAKER_00]: much much respect to each of you thank you
so uh yeah that's what i'm doing and much
[SPEAKER_01]: love to you guys thank you wade it was a
pleasure well i think it is it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: three o'clock uh eastern standard time i
think uh we should maybe close it down
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate everyone that came out today
etienne johnny always gunk man of course
[SPEAKER_01]: gunk man thank you everybody yeah markets
thank you for letting you keep it going
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone out in chat land tune in next
week keep growing this has been bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: man's hash church peace peace thank you
everybody may the full melt bless your
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl and we should finish off thanks y'all
[SPEAKER_05]: peace you you
