[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hash Church 3.0, episode 21.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will be... Owen Etienne is in the
room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome both to Wade and Etienne.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you guys are doing well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, Morgan.
[SPEAKER_10]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got to go share the channel and my
YouTube, the new link that just went up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So give me a few seconds to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing some nice spring weather
down in the Bay Area, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, well, you know, it's a
typical between 50s to 70s, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can definitely see the flowers on
the trees as well as the grasses are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So signs of spring are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, at night, you know, Orion's
starting to pass out here and we can see,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Mars still pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we've been pretty lucky all in
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: True that, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But up there, you should definitely be
seeing it warming up, yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the plum trees have bloomed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of the other fruit trees are
blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not blooming, they're budding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daffodils and the early spring flowers
are popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of color coming back to the
landscape, which is one of the beauties of
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had about three or four days in a
row of warm days, cool nights,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, snow has melted and yeah,
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's muted himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're muted, Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hear you, hippie.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like there's someone we can't see.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's three people entered the
waiting room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I better let those people in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Admit, admit, admit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would probably appreciate coming in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome to Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh is in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colin's just popping in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny fucking B is here, of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Skunkman Sam, a man who really
shouldn't need an introduction,
[SPEAKER_10]: but there's a little one anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we stretching our necks out,
guys?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stretching my neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: My neck's been lacking a little weird in
the last six hours, so I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Ruthie in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Going good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, you're making me miss my
regenerative hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the last nine months, I'm like,
I got to mail him a new one and I just
[SPEAKER_05]: have not done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I do with my old one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll mail you a new one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to get my act together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I'm mailing all the time,
but... I just can't remember what happened
[SPEAKER_10]: to my old one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wore that hat every day until it was...
It's kind of a good hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have like six of them that I rotate
through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I use a lot of these ones, you know,
the Embark ones, but this Method 7 one's
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's little and...
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wear what I have, but I do... I
missed the one and I can't remember who
[SPEAKER_10]: sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it might have been like... I
had the compost one that looked like
[SPEAKER_10]: Compton.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was dope.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was a dope one too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you hooked me up with
regenerative right after that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were my two favorite hats.
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome to the room, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuckin' where's Skye?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's Skye?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he's turned his camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's talking in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Skye!
[SPEAKER_10]: Stella!
[SPEAKER_10]: Stella!
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice, easy, chill morning here in Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a bunch of folks in the room right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many there are,
but I'm sure there's a few.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't seem to see the numbers here like
I usually do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope everyone's doing well today
at the end of another week.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just spent five days up in Whistler
myself, so I feel very regenerative,
[SPEAKER_10]: in fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my regeneration, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Humans need regeneration as well,
you know, to maintain sustainability.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plants and humans are very similar in that
way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you come out of your chrysalis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Popped right out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's spring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spring is in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those of you that don't know,
that is my time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a birthday coming up here in like
three days or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be 48 years old, March 31st.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my spring chicken birthday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I'm turning 48, but just
generally the mountain turns into a
[SPEAKER_10]: wonderland at the end of March.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll usually get one last storm we'll get
this really beautiful powder.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping on making it up to Whistler
for my birthday as some of my best
[SPEAKER_10]: birthdays have been up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend has dug out an igloo,
took him three weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: He dug out a beautiful igloo up on
Whistler Mountain and he's been hanging
[SPEAKER_10]: out with a pine Martin up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This little cool little weasel creature
has been coming up and visiting him and
[SPEAKER_10]: eating fruits and nuts out of his hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's just all around super cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking to go spend my birthday
with this little pine Martin, maybe a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of Ravens and some whiskey jacks
and some friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky and Kendall and the kids went up to
Kendall's cabin out near Valemont and
[SPEAKER_07]: snowmobiled like 80 kilometers out into
the high country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were feeding pine Martins too.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a whole pine Martin family that
was in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, they can be a vicious little
creature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just the coolest paws and have
these weird little noises.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like almost like snow otters.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have locking jaws.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ermine are really cool up here too,
which are white and they look similar to
[SPEAKER_07]: the pine Martin, but they're smaller and
they're completely white.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are, I've seen them on the mountain,
which is incredible to say because they
[SPEAKER_10]: are next to impossible to see.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have seen them on the mountains
before those perfectly white ones that
[SPEAKER_10]: just, you know, they, you only see them
while they're moving.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the minute they stop moving,
they just disappear in the snow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the rare occasion of seeing a
Wolverine recently coming down from
[SPEAKER_07]: Revelstoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just this amazing creature,
you know, coming across the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if anyone knows about
Wolverines, but they're one of the most
[SPEAKER_07]: elusive beings in our forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other elusive beings in our
forest is the mountain caribou and the
[SPEAKER_07]: mountain caribou are also kind of
threatened in this, in this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a thing that everyone should
know about called the Y to Y corridor,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the yellow stone to yellow knife
or to the, yeah, to yellow knife up in
[SPEAKER_07]: Northwest territories corridor where
they're trying to keep as much of an
[SPEAKER_07]: intact corridor of wilderness going up,
you know, to, to Alaska to keep that
[SPEAKER_07]: flowing for animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Purcell wilderness is in that and
people should look into the Purcell
[SPEAKER_07]: wilderness and, and even Willett
wilderness forever is an area that people
[SPEAKER_07]: are trying to make into the park.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please look into Willett wilderness
forever and see if you can sign those
[SPEAKER_07]: petitions and just create more wilderness
in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautifully said.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend Bushy Wayne on Instagram posted
a footage of, I don't know if it was
[SPEAKER_10]: Wolverine or Badger, but it was one of the
two and it was their tracks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was following it in his,
I don't, I think it was in his plane,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it seemed like a helicopter footage,
but you're just over this crazy like
[SPEAKER_10]: forested snow covered mountain range.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just see these tracks and he
follows them for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a, it's pretty cool footage for those
of you that might want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also Bush Wayne is really cool and
does amazing stuff in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know he's a friend of yours,
Marcus, and his partner is important to
[SPEAKER_07]: note Sarah and everything, but amazing
stuff that Bush Wayne is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I wanted to shout out both Bingo
Lombardi and 70s mama who have just been,
[SPEAKER_10]: they've been the admins in our chat room
here in YouTube for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just don't think we give them enough
props.
[SPEAKER_10]: 70s mama has been away and we've been
missing her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She just came on just now and said she
would love to invite Wade Lafter to speak
[SPEAKER_10]: to her CSC students about Harlequin and
CBD in general.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was lucky enough to speak to her
students.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_10]: 70s mama has been one of our long time
admins and she's been taking care of the
[SPEAKER_10]: chat.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Wade, I can hook you up with her
afterwards and I'm sure you can help her
[SPEAKER_10]: out and do something wonderful together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, I consider that the primary focus
of my work is helping people understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what cannabis can do in addition to the
lovely benefit of getting aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, please Marcus, hook us up and I'd
be glad to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, shout out to 70s mama as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: She invited me on to one of her classes as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a wonderful, fun, easygoing
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll enjoy it, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another person who does classes is Selena
Wong who lives in Vernon and she's been on
[SPEAKER_10]: Hash Church before and she's had her own
show on here, the Selena Wong show,
[SPEAKER_10]: the Flower of Life show.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she does a class with some local
native women.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also did her class and it was,
I think I've done it twice now,
[SPEAKER_10]: in fact, and it was also well worth the
time and energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just thought it was great to meet
some new folks and hear from them and help
[SPEAKER_10]: educate them on things that I happen to
know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm sure Selena would be pretty
stoked to have any of the people on the
[SPEAKER_10]: panel here, Dragonfly Earth Madison and
Josh and Wade and Etienne and everyone
[SPEAKER_10]: really.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that you guys would do good to get
in touch with her as well because she's
[SPEAKER_10]: doing good things as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're super in touch with Selena.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think she's one of the greatest people
ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: She does do really amazing work,
part of the spiritual community in British
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I'm pretty sure she has an
online website that's maybe a dispensary
[SPEAKER_07]: of some type and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, she's a really beautiful woman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We support her in every way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like to shout out Brandon and Amanda
down at Cush Kirk for this guava punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just made this guava punch hash at the
house here the other day with a Subsidium
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Cannabinered Lachlan and Adam and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And wow, this guava punch came out like
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something they bred down there on
their farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, guava punch came out of the guava
and the punch breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got the punch breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, the strawberry guava.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure it's a strawberry guava by
punch breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they gave us seeds last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grew them on the property.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, Fino hunted it, cloned it,
got it out to the community here in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Kootenays and started making hash with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_07]: This other one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like rosin to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: From flour?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made ice water hash out of fresh,
frozen, pressed it at 180 degrees and have
[SPEAKER_07]: kept it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost rips your face apart when you
open the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just peels your skin back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like... A little guava?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a little grape guava that was given
to me by... No, this one was given to me
[SPEAKER_10]: by Globby Johnson.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've got the banana pudding that
was given to me by pressed out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They look very similar in color for
certain of what you have there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to get together and have a
little puff down soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on mute, Josh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glue pig from Josh Wax down in LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: The glue pig.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave us the alien OG, the glue pig,
the hog's breath and something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the hash just turned out really
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the rosin and hash both turned out
really good from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's have ourselves a little bowl
here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: We certainly don't snub our noses at some
nice solventless oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or for that matter, any type of oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have all sorts of different panelists
that enjoy all sorts of different things
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We try to be inclusive and remove
ourselves from these silly divisions that
[SPEAKER_10]: we get caught up in sometimes as human
beings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh, did you get to deploy any of the
things I sent over to you, the little
[SPEAKER_04]: notes here and there in the process?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want everyone to know how stoked
I am about college.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Josh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like you guys are walking in code.
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped Josh with some freeze dryer
techniques and just gave him some pointers
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, just gave him the,
armed him with the right stuff and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he took the sheet music and
made some beautiful music, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as I call it, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this something we're sharing with our
audience or is this something that we're
[SPEAKER_10]: keeping a little closer to our chest?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're keeping it a little closer but it's,
you know, I just had to ask because we
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about it for so long, like a while
ago and I just, we haven't checked in on
[SPEAKER_04]: each other and I just wanted to ask
because you pulled up that beautiful jar
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like, that looks pretty
familiar.
[SPEAKER_10]: The same reason I asked because it was
mentioned on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to mention like, are we talking
about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk about it in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe one day I'll invite a bunch of
people on who use freeze dryers and we'll
[SPEAKER_10]: spend the first hour just talking about
settings and how to sublimate out the
[SPEAKER_10]: water.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as tricky as you might think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Depending on the type of freeze dryer that
you have, it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: You learn the variables and then you tune
the variables to find the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how you do that is by making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_10]: You make little mistakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They direct you as long as you're paying
attention and you have that awareness,
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Making rosin is no different.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got pressure, you've got heat,
you've got time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are your three variables.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you're going to tune each of those
variables in and you're going to hone in
[SPEAKER_10]: on that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sweet spot could change from
person to person.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it's always about definitely
getting my yield because I hate the idea
[SPEAKER_10]: of leaving things behind, but also
preserving, you know, the flavor as much
[SPEAKER_10]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's kind of my process.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use a bunch of different freeze dryers
at my work.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a freeze dryer conversation really
would have to be with people who are using
[SPEAKER_10]: the same freeze dryers, because if you've
got people who are using LabConcos and
[SPEAKER_10]: people who are using freeze drycos,
the conversation is not going to be the
[SPEAKER_10]: same conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be thinking that what one person
says doesn't align with what the other
[SPEAKER_10]: person says.
[SPEAKER_04]: In elevation I find sometimes has a big
play into settings as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that'll change based on where
you are geographically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Flynn from Wook Sauce Winery has
some really good tech and Ganja Gill is
[SPEAKER_07]: just bigging him up on his story not too
long ago for helping him bring his dry
[SPEAKER_07]: time down quite a bit and also continue to
keep his quality up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that, you know, if you can keep
your times down and still at times down,
[SPEAKER_07]: turps up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of a... Letcher got it down to
seven hours, but it's also, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: part of that is that his screens that he
uses that we purchased that insert into
[SPEAKER_10]: the freeze dryer, they have very big metal
frames and then they're basically screens
[SPEAKER_10]: that the hash sits on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the sublimation of the water happens
way faster, but it's also seemingly faster
[SPEAKER_10]: because you put a lot less hash in because
of that big metal frame.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we first started, I can't tell you
how many times I muffined out my freeze
[SPEAKER_10]: dryer, putting in so much hash that every
single tray that I pulled out was like the
[SPEAKER_10]: hash had risen right to the top of the
bottom of the next tray.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the cleaning of the freeze dryer when
you do that is extreme.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that silicone mat that is on the top.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, freeze dryers tend to look like
they're upside down when they go in.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because those heaters have a
silicone mat that goes over top of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of what buffers the heat
and controls the sublimation of the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we used to, oh my God, we used to
put like three, four wet kilos of hash
[SPEAKER_10]: into these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount that seems to come out
perfectly is, you know, around 700 to 800
[SPEAKER_10]: dried grams from a harvest right at least,
which is really the freeze dryer that 90%
[SPEAKER_10]: of people in the industry and community
are using right now because they're a
[SPEAKER_10]: liquefaction oven that is like,
really the most basic one that you could
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly buy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because of freeze dry co, who is the
manufacturer for harvest right and makes
[SPEAKER_10]: all of those freeze dryers, they already
had a business where they were creating
[SPEAKER_10]: freeze dryers for a variety of industries.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to create a little side hub where they
could just start pumping out these very
[SPEAKER_10]: small little home units, really,
even the laboratory one is more of a home
[SPEAKER_10]: unit than not.
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, I got attacked pretty good
on my Facebook page the other day when I
[SPEAKER_10]: mentioned to a friend to avoid using the
oil pumps that come with the harvest
[SPEAKER_10]: rights.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, this guy just came up at me
fairly intellectually, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: not very passive aggressively.
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt like he had just been, you know,
under house arrest, like all of us for the
[SPEAKER_10]: last year and was probably at the rope.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was like, I think I'll take it out
on bubble man today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that seems like as good as any.
[SPEAKER_10]: And his argument was that, you know,
the oil pumps work fine if you know how to
[SPEAKER_10]: use the the oil and the heart and the pump
properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I love the idea of mitigating all
risk when it comes to and funny enough,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, just as I'm about to talk about
mitigating risk in a laboratory,
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Mark Sheldon pops into the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well played, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you didn't hear what I just said,
but I'm talking about mitigating risk in
[SPEAKER_10]: the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the atomized oil from those pumps that
unless you have it piped out of your lab
[SPEAKER_10]: goes into the air and is not good for for
humans and is definitely not something you
[SPEAKER_10]: want to find on your hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm talking about, Mark, right now,
why I think the scroll pump is a better
[SPEAKER_10]: idea than an oil pump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any lab for freeze drying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's basically the conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, first of all, the scroll
pump is way more expensive, but you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: have to deal with changing the oil like
after every batch, which, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_10]: is a very large vector for potential
contamination because the oil is kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: invisible and it transfers very easily
depending on your ability in the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone has different abilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's one good way to mitigate
that risk is by getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondary, the scroll pump in the long run
will be the cheaper option because you
[SPEAKER_10]: won't be continually buying oil to put
into the pump.
[SPEAKER_10]: It costs money to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And or a pump that breaks because you
didn't change the oil when you were
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's all about getting there's water
that ends up in that oil and then you have
[SPEAKER_10]: to separate it, filter it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They give you the whole thing,
but it's nasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no invariably all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that pump exhaust should be exhausted
like out of fume hood because otherwise
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to develop this film of stuff
all over the inside of your lab,
[SPEAKER_06]: which you're trying to keep clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a greasy kind of grime that just
ends up collecting everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll attract us to and why people
aren't thinking about it is because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: invisible basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one difference that they're not doing
is doing microbial testing on their lab
[SPEAKER_10]: weekly where you just swab everything and
send it off and find out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not doing that and you're just
assuming that's scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new premium pumps, I'll just say you
can get like 20 cycles out of it without
[SPEAKER_07]: changing the oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm promoting the oil pump after
everything you said, but the new premium
[SPEAKER_07]: pumps that come from HarvestRite don't
have to be changed every single time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the scroll pumps are great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someone could put a link of some of
the squirrel pumps that you're talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about up on the chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Squirrel friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the squirrel pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Liboid is another great company that
has... Cold Palmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Cold Palmer is also another company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cold Palmer is a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I mean... Liboid is what VTA
uses and I've had a few of them on some
[SPEAKER_04]: other devices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's sometimes called diaphragm
pumps, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is a diaphragm pump the same as a scroll
pump?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the same, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely heard them spoken about in the
same sentence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the fundamental difference between
that and an oil pump is just the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: pumping mechanism is just oil free because
basically what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_06]: compressing and decompressing a diaphragm
which creates a vacuum, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have your valve set up,
right, as the diaphragm is decompressed,
[SPEAKER_06]: it creates a negative pressure or a
vacuum, which again creates sort of like
[SPEAKER_06]: this pulsating kind of negative pressure,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why there's kind of like a noise
to it because the diaphragm is going back
[SPEAKER_06]: and forth and it's only on the fourth
cycle that it actually pulls the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it needs to push.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pulling and pushing, pulling and
pushing, but you're only sort of capturing
[SPEAKER_06]: the pulling, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking very Jerry today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have the black shirt with the
hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I act like Jerry too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you just have the ism going,
you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to go back for one second on
scroll pumps versus diaphragms because I
[SPEAKER_10]: just checked it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: The scroll technology is based on smooth
orbital operation while diaphragm pumping
[SPEAKER_10]: involves abrupt cycling of the diaphragm
cylinder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're, so are they both
oil-less, Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they both, they don't involve in oil?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to go in deeper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scroll definitely does not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think diaphragm does either.
[SPEAKER_10]: They use two spiral scrolls to compress
air and move them towards you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, your point of oil
contamination in the hash is still,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, regardless, you want to
basically use an oil-free pump.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, oil-free pumps can only give
you a vacuum so much, but for just drying
[SPEAKER_06]: water, you only need that kind of vacuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really need a really,
really deep vacuum that only the oil can
[SPEAKER_06]: give you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, someone in the chat just
mentioned that the oil that Harvest Right
[SPEAKER_10]: Supplies is not the best oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely 100% agreed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But is there really a best oil to be
anywhere near your hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's the only one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, people really enjoyed that little
bit of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell you just from reading the
chat, people were like, bring it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got my notepad out.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is important information,
things that people are looking to save
[SPEAKER_10]: time and mitigate risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mark, does Harvest Right sell a pump
with their machine that they sell?
[SPEAKER_06]: The food-grade freeze dryer?
[SPEAKER_10]: They sell the oil pump that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an oil pump.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an upgrade too as well,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sell the scroll as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's $2,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, $1,400 US.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not the standard pump that,
so if someone gets a freeze dryer and they
[SPEAKER_06]: think that they have the thing that they
need to freeze dry their hash,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not the situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they can get the job done.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying they can't, but it seems
inevitable at one point that with all the
[SPEAKER_10]: risk, it's kind of like when you're back
in the day before PFTech came out,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is distilled water with spores for
mushrooms in a syringe, we had to use
[SPEAKER_10]: things called transfer chambers,
which of course Mark would know what that
[SPEAKER_10]: is because it's a pretty standard thing in
a lab when you really need to avoid this
[SPEAKER_10]: microbial world that we absolutely live
in.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to create a small chamber and
kill all the bacteria in it and go in with
[SPEAKER_10]: gloves and do your work in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so unless you're doing your oil
changes in there, to me, I just couldn't
[SPEAKER_10]: take the risk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time I saw that oil, I just wanted
it out of my lab immediately.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we made sure we did before
there was any problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really great if you can have kind of
like your vacuum pumps kind of like in
[SPEAKER_06]: like a mechanical room area that's
adequately ventilated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if they do end up spewing stuff,
it's kind of in a separate room from where
[SPEAKER_06]: your product is out and open because those
vacuum lines, they all need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: exhausted and very rarely go into a lab
and it'll smell sour and it'll be kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: like, again, that grime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, you guys realize you're
sending all that vacuum stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vacuum doesn't just disappear.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to go somewhere, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ends up all over your lab, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those microscopic particles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine a hash just could be a magnet
for all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you, and even worse so,
how about if they're making rosin and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're actually pressing rosin in
parchment paper, which we know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've even shown it right here on
Hash Church, even hash pressed in
[SPEAKER_10]: parchment paper, particularly touched by
humans seems to send and charge that thing
[SPEAKER_10]: statically.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when the rosin is hanging in a
band, you can take your finger and put it
[SPEAKER_10]: nearby and the rosin will go like this
towards your finger, which means no
[SPEAKER_10]: charge.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's literally, yeah, man, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take some hash or some rosin and put it in
parchment and like press it.
[SPEAKER_10]: With your hands a little bit and then open
it up and hang it and then go like this
[SPEAKER_10]: with your finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll literally see the rosin go like
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it on Hash Church for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wide world of hash, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's totally fucking cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you teach it to do tricks?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can, how about this from a
microbial or a contamination mind in a
[SPEAKER_10]: lab, would you want to see that shit like
exposed in any way?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's literally pulling, charged
pulling, like anything that's floating in
[SPEAKER_10]: the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you just have to be kept really,
really clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it'll take a little while,
but eventually people are going to become
[SPEAKER_10]: aware of all these things as they make
little mistakes in their labs and have
[SPEAKER_10]: their problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is a relatively new industry
and we're not all chemists that come from
[SPEAKER_10]: a chemistry background that we're trained
to work in labs, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best I could ever train my hash is to
burn up in a small series of fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only trick I've been able to
teach it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I put it on a little
flush jet before and flung it into a bowl,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always feel like the hash is training
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't touch me this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get stuck all over your
fingers, Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the Michael Pollan way of looking
at it, botany of desire for any of those
[SPEAKER_10]: of you who have read that book.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's an interesting thing when
you think of almost like cordyceps
[SPEAKER_10]: infecting the mind of the insect to climb
to the tallest tree so it can fruit and
[SPEAKER_10]: explode its spores to find more insects to
infect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sometimes wonder like, is Skunkman Sam
breeding cannabis or is cannabis directing
[SPEAKER_10]: Skunkman Sam through something some sort
of, what do you think, Skunkman?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wag the tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botany of desire, but desire is what binds
you to the wheel of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we all got to get away from
botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll just grow itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I've always kind of
convinced that is like, man has always
[SPEAKER_03]: sprayed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, cannabis has gotten man to spread it
throughout the entire world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think cannabis is a wee bit
smarter than some of us humans in some
[SPEAKER_03]: respects.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things we're getting ready to
do on the farm today, as soon as we're
[SPEAKER_07]: finished, is plant ganja outside,
because it's a really good planting.
[SPEAKER_07]: What moon is it today?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Libra.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is Libra good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Libra is just a, it's an air sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really awesome for flowers only.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't want to be planting any
of your veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for in the next couple of days when
the moon moves into cancer or Scorpio
[SPEAKER_00]: moves into Scorpio in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's just going to be way
better for your pumpkins and your squashes
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of your brassicas and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to get those in the garden,
as well as all of your peas and your
[SPEAKER_00]: spinaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next couple of days,
but today is a really awesome day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomorrow morning, for planting
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of half in and half out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, all I can do is look outside and
go, oh, geez, it's a planting day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting, we're direct sowing
everything this year, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even doing any little pots,
no lights anywhere of nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just realized that we can direct sow
with some greenhouse plastic over some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if people look at it,
utilize the sunlight just seems like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, after 30 days, 40 years of
growing, we've just come to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, what's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we grow gardens for when we're
89 or 90?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to carry pots around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just carry a little bag of seeds out to
the garden and direct sow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only plants that we may put in pots
are some of the ones that we may want to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep as a male.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did think about, we tried digging up
some of the males out of the direct sow,
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some cases that worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to put it in the shade in a,
in a creek.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put it in a creek in the shade for a
couple of days, let it like kind of come
[SPEAKER_07]: back to life, then repot it, then bring it
up into a semi shady area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It keeps growing and it gives us pollen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some ways I like that better than
cutting the top off and putting it in a
[SPEAKER_07]: glass jar, but you can cut the top off and
put it in the glass jar when it's fruited
[SPEAKER_07]: enough, but you have to get it fruited
enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes that means there's pollen
going through the air, but you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: so it's good to have research and
developing farms out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this year you can look on our
Instagram in the last couple of days,
[SPEAKER_07]: we showed how we've prepared our beds this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really like, you know, the rameel
chipped wood chips and how they are going
[SPEAKER_07]: to feed our rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really liked the idea that when the
seed germinates and the first root comes
[SPEAKER_07]: out, it's going to hit mycorrhizal spores
and indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all the roots are going to grow
through these birch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Birch chips that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the fungi is going to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see how easy it is for the fungi
to come on and eat like sawdust and wood
[SPEAKER_07]: chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just going to be this total fusion
of fungi and roots growing together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the oil secretions that come
from the way that the plant uptakes those
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it comes out in the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have a juicy, rich, gnarly soil,
real substrate, it comes out in the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the trichomes get more amazing and the
flavors are stronger and they last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked, too, on the chat,
I just want to address it because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: super awesome question about planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they riz, your temperatures at night
are around five degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can really start planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just telling you that it's a good,
yeah, or 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just telling you, hey,
you know, it's probably a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: start putting in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be super wet and rainy
and that temperature, you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold off until the rain sort of pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you've got optimal soil
temperatures as well as optimal moon
[SPEAKER_00]: signs, somebody wrote in there that it's
pseudoscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the moon signs are what moves
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon signs are what decides when
plants uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees, we know when we look at when
they're in a water sign, they uptake a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount more of water and
different humidities during that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've tried to do all different types
of tests, you know, planting in a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: moon right next to one in a water moon and
be like, yeah, you know, we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to document this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes we have to push it because
you just can't get around it and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant anyway, because we're running out
of time or the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice it's it's it's tremendously
different when you hit it on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to when you don't, it's it's
and Maria Maria Maria Thune is one
[SPEAKER_07]: biodynamic woman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she did tons of tests and proved,
you know, that she even modified the
[SPEAKER_07]: biodynamic planting calendar into a more
modern calendar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, now is a really good time to
plant outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can plant outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing, if you make hash and it has
a little seed in it, you can put the hash
[SPEAKER_07]: out in on your beds, you know,
like the leftover leaf while you're making
[SPEAKER_07]: hash, the seeds kind of germinate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sort of they don't germinate,
but they they soak like you would a
[SPEAKER_07]: sprout.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you put the the hash drags
out on your this for the home gardener out
[SPEAKER_07]: on the on the soil, like in a greenhouse,
I you know, you could do that for the last
[SPEAKER_07]: month.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had drags with seeds in it on top of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And soon as the earth temperature gets
warm enough, sprouts come up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in some there's some beds out there
that have like a thousand sprouts coming
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these seeds have been frozen 50 times
over the last, you know, two months
[SPEAKER_07]: because it freezes nearly every night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what seeds go through is something
called serotiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some like through the winter seeds
fall in the fall and they go through the
[SPEAKER_07]: serotinous state where they go dormant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though they're starting to germinate,
they go dormant until the temperatures
[SPEAKER_07]: come right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cannabis seeds are like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can plant a cannabis seed in colder
temperatures than, say, you can put a
[SPEAKER_07]: clone outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who's a gardener knows that,
you know, volunteers coming up are so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so much more adapted to the soil
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready for the microbial life that
they're going to uptake because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: already known it throughout the whole
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I'm still seeing on the chats
here that somebody is talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudoscience and they want the scientific
paper as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and let's look back before
industrialized revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientific papers on the moon signs
and moon plantings were incredibly vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back to the early 1800s and way
into the early 1900s before we started
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanized big agriculture that really is
aligned with, you know, not nature and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not really looking at
natural sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let, you know, I just want to let
people know that there's paper out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a lot of comparison studies
that will actually really blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll leave it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rudolf Steiner wrote one million pages of
documents before 1920.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can decide whether you think they're
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple of questions on that last
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't point to the paper, but I know
that in the in the forestry world,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some evidence that there's a large
amount of firewood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to see somebody who's been
looking at what, what sort of harvest in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of firewood and or lumber by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see based on when the tree is cut
and trees that are cut in full moon,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in water science produce like
as much as 40% more by weight at harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it relevant to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't prove that, but I definitely,
I use the biodynamic calendar in the work
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep appreciation to Ms. Thun indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you soak the seeds before you put them
in direct soil sowing in a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_01]: do you water the soil to keep them moist
enough that they sprout?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just soak them in our mouth and usually
I'll count how many holes that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do and in each hole we'll maybe put three
to five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do this and we can direct so
like this because we are breeders and we
[SPEAKER_00]: do have so many seeds and people gift us
so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this ability to maybe pick the
very best female in each hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll sort of count all of the different
holes that I want to plant and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: count out the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put them in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sort of suck on them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make all of the labels and the name
tags that you know is needed for those
[SPEAKER_00]: holes and then I'll just plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only gets a pre-soak with saliva.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would probably add that the most magical
thing is that we use a dowsing crystal and
[SPEAKER_07]: this will be really great for the people
who love pseudoscience.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use a dowsing crystal over every one of
our seed packages and we truly believe in
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lay our seeds out in front of us on a
table from all the people that we get it
[SPEAKER_07]: from and we use a crystal and you can get
a yes or a no from the crystal on whether
[SPEAKER_07]: that plant, you have to ask an intentional
simple question.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to say is this, whatever you
want, is this medicine good for me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this medicine make hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Will this cure Crohn's disease,
cancer, whatever it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you ask the question to this crystal
and that goes through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we choose our seeds based off that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we put them in our mouth to get the
DNA and then we will roll it in lush
[SPEAKER_07]: roots, a little mycorrhizal fungi with our
saliva on it and then we'll put it into
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil direct, which also has indigenous
microorganisms and all of the other living
[SPEAKER_07]: cultures that we've put into the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we wet the soil down and then
that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We let nature and soil germinate the seed
and it's our belief that if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: grow out of that soil in that moonsign
with that, then really it's not meant to
[SPEAKER_07]: be on our land and grown out with our
intentions the way that we want it to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand if someone has specific
seeds that they want to grow, there's
[SPEAKER_07]: other ways of doing it, but this is just
the way that we do it on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the way that we've come to
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we do a lot of tests and a lot of
different observations and we'll soak some
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll put some over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try some in wherever, but it's just
good to always try out different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're rich in seeds or you're a
breeder, then why not try out a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different mediums and a lot of different
areas and try to plant out of moonsigns
[SPEAKER_00]: that are optimal and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really awesome because people
can listen to us here on Hashchurch or
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go and do it themselves because I
feel like the very best relationship that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have not only with nature,
but with the cannabis plant is to grow our
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why you put it in your
mouth is because you're creating that
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the seed, with your DNA,
with the microbiology in your mouth and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we compare microbiology of the soil
to the microbiology of our own body,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's totally similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in soil and what makes plants and
trees healthy is the same microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps break down our own food inside
of our body, which helps make us healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that often we're always looking
for proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And proof is always given in science when
we isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we isolate things, we're only
seeing it from a very small pinpoint place
[SPEAKER_00]: in a whole universe of microcosmic
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when we are relying on
just pinpoint accuracies, I think that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are not valuing all of the possibilities
that nature and humanity has to offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone asked how long we keep the seeds
in the mouth and you can keep the seeds in
[SPEAKER_07]: your mouth as long as really you want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could say your favorite prayer or you
could set your intention for that seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how long you kept it in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's again, you've an intuition.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you guys are talking and that was
just awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone sent me this stuff a while back
and you're telling me I should like roll
[SPEAKER_11]: my peats after roots in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: My little fungi, you know, if it's the
spore has to touch the root in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: A living root.
[SPEAKER_07]: In order for the spore to come alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can get direct contact.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can get direct contact.
[SPEAKER_11]: I dip this into this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just opened this right now as you're
talking about this, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been, someone sent me this for pro
mix a while back.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just curious about it because now
I'm really interested in what you're
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just running around.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to just get my clones and
when they root, I would just kind of roll
[SPEAKER_11]: that in some of this stuff or is that what
you're saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just read this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what you do is you would make a
little mycorrhizal solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could use a little cornstarch and
water and, and, and make a little dip gel
[SPEAKER_07]: with mycorrhizal fungi and maybe aloe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can dip your, you can dip
your cutting into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you do the cutting out as aloe
juice and mycorrhizal fungi on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, you want it wrapped around
the stock of the clone that you're taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you put the corn in what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear what you said there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my microphone's over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I cut a clone, I would dip it
enough into something like this first,
[SPEAKER_11]: before I put it into the P and then allow
it to root, but not after.
[SPEAKER_07]: Inoculate the Pete, the stock,
and when you transplant it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you did.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't overuse it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would use the mycorrhizal fungi and I
would just flag like with mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, check the sourcing of the
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that is grown on GMO substrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it's certified organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if you want to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is just single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be only feeding, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a single species poly poly
culture is just super important.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, and we're, we're
recommending a living microbial cloning,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, often cloning is used with,
with fungicides and, and a sterile
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: The type of cloning that we're talking
about is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you make a living soil bed and you
put mycorrhizal fungi and stocks in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the roots come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're full of white hairs and the white
hairs are where the plant uptakes
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're automatically getting an
inoculation on your root and that
[SPEAKER_07]: inoculation stays with the plant its
entire life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's important to get the
mycorrhizal fungi root on there as soon as
[SPEAKER_07]: possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, a lot of people do indigenous
microorganisms and make soils that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: getting mycorrhizal fungi wild from their
roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's important to get the
mycorrhizal fungi on the environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also recommended.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also recommended.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, if you want to ensure,
you know, the studied mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_07]: thing, you can do a very easy root dip or,
or dusting of the roots in the very
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that looked, it will last its
whole entire life.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't necessarily even have to do it
again, unless maybe two weeks into it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could do another trench and an
inoculated root zone is going to help your
[SPEAKER_07]: plant double in size, which is why we joke
around lush roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: 840 that we have is 420 times two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, you got,
you know, Josh, the, I've been using your
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And boy, have I seen incredible increase
in vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lush roots alone is, is really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some, some really isolated tests
with some motor breath 15, some Chem D,
[SPEAKER_04]: some sour diesel clones, and then just
recently banana, you know, strong Nana
[SPEAKER_04]: clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am seeing side-by-side results and,
you know, I've always rolled my clones in
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal and then, then transplanted,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But having this, this lush roots is,
is really incredible stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, Johnny, if you should get
some, man, it's, it's really great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I plan on continuing to incorporate
it into my whole regimen at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really beautiful work guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time I listened to you guys talk
about this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to like change everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've redone the whole room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at cutting new clones,
tying things down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have these products and I'm going to be
like calling you guys daily on your phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any questions or comments,
feel free to reach out to me and I'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: happy to answer them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Josh.
Well, I appreciate it.
Thank you both for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to touch really quickly on
what Josh was saying about this idea of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of what is sterile and the idea of
bringing sort of half sterilized
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like these half sterilized
techniques too, you know, with the mask
[SPEAKER_00]: and what people are wearing and like what
is sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is not sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like microbial life is all around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we call something clean,
we tend to go towards maybe the science
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it and say sterilized is what is
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to sort of open up the minds
to people on the idea that when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of beneficial
microbiology on your side and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with beneficial microbiology,
then that can be more of a definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: what clean is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we utilize microbiology everywhere
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's on the plants that you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting cuttings or you're
getting clones, there's already an
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic system within those cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that's truly sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're using a product like a dip
or something that's used for rooting gels
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, that's a fungicide
that Josh said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually sterilizing everything
around where you're dipping it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that you're killing all of the
bacteria, all of the fungi, even the
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic fungi, which is inside or the
cyanobacteria, which is on the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you have a healthy clone,
then you really don't want to be killing
[SPEAKER_00]: that because that's your health,
that's your vitality, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being in the plant that's going to go
up inside of the plant and become its own
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you ally with this microbiology
that we're talking about, like these endos
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ectos, it's really similar to just
allying with nature and getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness from nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little thought there for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And healthy microbes eat pathogens as
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's their whole entire purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fusarium and pythium tend to propagate
in sterile cloning environments.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why tissue culture has become such
a big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Mark can tell, or someone can talk
about tissue culture and how that's
[SPEAKER_07]: different than what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe that, like Kelly said,
a healthy microbiology system eats
[SPEAKER_07]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say I cut clones two days
ago, so I'm going to go in, pull those out
[SPEAKER_11]: of the peats, make up this, dip it in
there and put them back in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause they're probably just starting to
swell a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have that little window right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for the lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that's what I'm doing this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't
wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got quiet for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a little dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had an amazing trip, we'll just say,
and we got to visit Terry Willard and
[SPEAKER_07]: Alexandra on the island.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just such amazing people and
they're elders in our community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they started, you know, people should
look into Wild Rose College.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an herbal college online and people
have, they've been just doing them,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they even have a cannabis course
now that they're doing online,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I think is really valuable to like
the home grower and people beyond.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really wonderful to see their way
they've transformed their six acres and
[SPEAKER_07]: utilizing alternative energy and
hugelkultur swales and polyculture
[SPEAKER_07]: diversity and all the different medicines
that they're making.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, going along the coast,
we just got- And it just, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: reminding me, I don't want to cut you off
just really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the world is a really
crazy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has a backyard or even like a
five by 10 piece of land, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, gardening is so incredibly
healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, even if you're going to only
grow like a couple of tomato plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can watch them grow, that means that
you're outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just am really encouraging people to
have little backyard gardens or to share
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard gardens with those people who do
have backyards because we really believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that backyard gardens are going to be what
saves the earth and it's humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the earth is going to be
totally fine whether we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'll be way better if we're not
here, but since we are here and we do want
[SPEAKER_00]: to save ourselves, then I think it's
probably really optimal that we all get
[SPEAKER_00]: into backyard gardening and growing our
own food so that we can be eating good
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and uptaking good microbiology
so that we have the ability to think
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the box of with which just
science and media is teaching us something
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of that, I think will be really
helpful for our species.
[SPEAKER_07]: And building bird houses, at houses,
and minor bee hotels are a really good
[SPEAKER_07]: thing to do right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to build swallow houses
because the swallows come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote a note from last year that they
came back on April 15th.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to prepare.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have a good amount of swallow
houses for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So creating habitat is also very important
in a time when we're losing a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peppers are an easy thing to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you eat peppers, you got to clean
out the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have pepper seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just had a meal with peppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter was so inspired.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, Dad, look, there's all the
seeds here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, OK, let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All different kinds of peppers you now
have seeds for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many things we eat have seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are so many things we can save seeds
from that we eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we often throw it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with tomatoes, you kind of eat the
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So with some things, you eat the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so we tried to actually strain out of
some of the tomato pulp a few of the
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it didn't really work out too well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just go buy those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing with us is we live close to,
and you would love these guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh and Kelly, our local Amish farmer who
we've been buying produce from him for
[SPEAKER_06]: probably about 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've seen his business grow to where
he's making packaged goods now and has
[SPEAKER_06]: dairy, which means he needs refrigeration,
which when we first went there,
[SPEAKER_06]: they had no electricity at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just kind of like a farm stand,
literally just selling produce that was
[SPEAKER_06]: just freshly harvested.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now more of the Amish market,
the baked goods and dairy stuff and stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, man, they're totally
regenerative farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell because when you go there,
you see it happening and the whole family
[SPEAKER_06]: is involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: They peacefully coexist.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of live in Philadelphia creep
suburbia, suburbia from Philadelphia and
[SPEAKER_06]: Westchester and Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all kind of creep together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, where we live now 20, 30 years,
well, like 20 years ago here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 40 years ago, this was all farmland.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Amish basically run all of the
local farms in this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're just amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're growing hemp now, too,
which is really amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we try to support our local Amish guy
because it means the world to him that my
[SPEAKER_06]: wife is there probably two or three times
a week buying our fresh produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll buy our eggs and some of our dairy,
not all of our dairy from him.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, man, I mean, it's regenerative
farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of their livestock practice is all
organic and open range for their chickens
[SPEAKER_06]: and their turkeys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell goat milk and goat cheese,
which is really, again, probably unique to
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe not unique to them,
but it's so great that they can peacefully
[SPEAKER_06]: coexist and farm in 2021 by the methods
that I think have been farmed for
[SPEAKER_06]: generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I butted into everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to say that if you want
to say tomato seeds, two points.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, make sure it's not a hybrid because
you can't save hybrid tomato seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, so you use an open pollinated old
fashioned type variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second thing is you scoop out or squeeze
out the seeds and you put them in a glass
[SPEAKER_02]: jar and let them ferment for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you take them out, wash them in clean
water, dry them, and you can use them next
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when it's ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But without that fermentation product,
it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dropping the real knowledge here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me more, Sam, about the you can't if
it's a hybrid, because I assume like when
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy tomatoes, like at the grocery store,
that those are probably all commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it likely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it so can you say what you said
before, which is that you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_06]: to take those seeds from those tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not that you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's they won't reproduce like the hybrid
because a hybrid, an F1 hybrid has two
[SPEAKER_02]: different parents, two different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you only are reproducing the F1,
which is it's not this an F1 hybrid when
[SPEAKER_02]: you self into itself, it'll produce 25
percent like the mother, 25 percent like
[SPEAKER_02]: the father and 50 percent somewhere in
between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you use like an heirloom
variety of tomato like Brandywine,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, that's true breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ferment the seeds and save
them, they will absolutely work wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've done it for decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the Roma tomato is one that is
still somewhat a heritage variety that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can also keep seeds from, which is one of
the most common ones in the grocery store
[SPEAKER_07]: that's actually still an old variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we we've grown Roma tomatoes for a
while in this one area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where the tomatoes have kind of gotten
mature, the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes we just leave them out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They drop the seeds and they just keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Year after year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a wonderful tomato that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just you can eat them just raw,
just with salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're just yeah, you can put
them in sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love those tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love rums.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife's favorite is Brandywine.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite is Cherokee purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't beat it in my case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, you mentioned not being able to start
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a reason why are they just not
fertile or what's the reasoning behind the
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids not being able to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's that they will grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of being the F1 hybrid that
the parents were, they will be F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, 25 percent like the mother,
25 percent like the father and 50 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I doubt very many of the them will be
like the F1 hybrid that you bought in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first place because it was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you were saying there about
supporting the local Amish people is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also supporting your local biome
and what everybody is talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're getting those cheeses and
when you're getting those veggies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supporting your own healthy
microbiome, which is inevitably your own
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy microbiome, which is really
awesome and intelligent to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what we're talking about here
with germination of any kind of seeds is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it doing in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomatoes are really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up all over the garden as
volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do that is when a tomato
drops off of the plant hole and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: overwinters and it's rotting or
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of its own serotoness, sugars,
carbohydrates, its own state, then it has
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability, those enzymes eat away at the
outside or the whole of the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which helps it to germinate faster in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're planting seeds,
you want to be able to think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, what is it doing in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can I mimic that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it will have its best germination
as well as its most potential growth
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some seeds have to be frozen or
they will not grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about seeds of everything in
the universe and other things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one has its own, like you say,
if you see how they propagate in nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably what you have to do
something to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're growing a California sequoia,
a giant sequoia in our yard that was
[SPEAKER_07]: started by our neighbor who's an elder
arborist naturalist.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he got the seeds while he was down in
the sequoias.
[SPEAKER_07]: He brought them back, you know,
the pine cones or the sequoia cones,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call them, brought them back up,
put them in his freezer for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he did because that's how long
it took.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he took the seeds out of the
freezer and propagated about 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's got them growing on his property.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we have a giant sequoia that's
probably around 10 feet tall now growing
[SPEAKER_07]: in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the dawn redwood growing on
our property, which is the redwood from
[SPEAKER_07]: China.
[SPEAKER_07]: For so many years, you know, in America
and North American and European botanists
[SPEAKER_07]: used to think that the only redwoods were
in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I believe it was the 30s,
botanists were traveling the world and
[SPEAKER_07]: studying species.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they came across this firewood.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the story I heard someone could
maybe prove me wrong or something that
[SPEAKER_07]: when they found this firewood and they
said, wow, this looks like redwood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you take me to where the tree is?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they took him to the tree and they're
like, holy, this is like a type of
[SPEAKER_07]: sequoia.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's sequoia meta meta something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the scientific name.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's called a dawn redwood.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this redwood loses its needles in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it grows back in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely grows different.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like the larch tree or the tamarack
over in this area, those are the two
[SPEAKER_07]: conifers that I can think of at the moment
that lose their leaves or their needles in
[SPEAKER_07]: the fall and then grow them back bright
green in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we were able to propagate unique
conifer trees on our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sequoia redwoods, when I was young,
my mom took me to Kings Canyon and Sequoia
[SPEAKER_02]: National Parks in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sold little redwood trees growing
about six inches tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could buy them for like five bucks
from the camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of the forest office gift
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can still get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I belong to a couple of local bonsai
societies and they have a spring where
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone will bring out their sprouts and
they'll do a little exchange as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: you can buy certain trees or some
starters.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an Oakland bonsai as well
because they've got a full on redwood
[SPEAKER_03]: bonsai here, which is part of the national
bonsai's western docents, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually here in Oakland, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have an amazing program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as well as the first female bonsai
master, she went to Japan and studied and
[SPEAKER_03]: she is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's such a fucking badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I want to give a shout out to Danny
and Alice in Mallorca, these incredible
[SPEAKER_10]: people that hosted us some years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple of friends of mine, Los Gardens
was with me and Neil, who's yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: just a long time good friend of mine who
grew all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas my bike that I used to press and
he's the grower behind that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I went and visited his grow a few
times and did some did some things on him
[SPEAKER_10]: as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we went there and they were the most
gracious hosts.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a little shop there and he was
growing spectacular herb that he was
[SPEAKER_10]: selling at his shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he really sort of showed us around the
island of Mallorca, gave us the history of
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we rented motorcycles and cruised all
around these epic areas in Mallorca.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he they just had a second a second
child.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just after we had left, they had had
their first child and now they just had
[SPEAKER_10]: their second.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he says, yes, we have Sky, who is now
two and Austin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to shout them out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just such awesome people growing
beautiful fruit in Mallorca.
[SPEAKER_10]: With beautiful property.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've never been to Mallorca,
I would check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very unique island.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a it's a it's a destination for
cyclists and motorcyclists, because one of
[SPEAKER_10]: the areas that we went on had this
incredible road that you just I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: the closest thing I ever saw to it was in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Switzerland certainly isn't like a
tropical island.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it's just, you know,
across the water from Barcelona in between
[SPEAKER_10]: Africa and Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's definitely a cool spot and a
worthwhile spot to go check out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys still have your
shop over there, Danny.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you do and you want to say the
name, I'll gladly shout that out as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you do go to Mallorca,
I would suggest supporting Danny and Alice
[SPEAKER_10]: in all of their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Balearic Islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel blessed to have gotten to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sa Calobra.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the motorcycle ride.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys want to Google Sa Calobra.
[SPEAKER_10]: That that is the road that you can see on
Mallorca that, of course, we had to ride
[SPEAKER_10]: motorcycles and rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, John was there also.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: John was also on that trip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Neil and John as well as Los Gardens and
myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: So much fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to kind of bounce back to a
second for the redwood there that was
[SPEAKER_03]: found in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that goes back to
Gondwanaland when it was all one landmass
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of those things that was left in a
pocket per se?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I always kind of
wondered if, you know, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, was kind of spread around,
you know, via Gondwanaland per se,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was never originally found in
North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was seemed to have been found later on
here, but in other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always been kind of fascinated
about the one landmass that has kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: always spread out in the flora and fauna
that have survived in region.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, we also have the coastal
redwoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of which you used to harvest in,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The coastal redwoods are the Sequoia
sempervirens and the Sierra Nevadas are
[SPEAKER_07]: the Sequoia giganticum, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a really interesting
hypothesis, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when we're talking about plants
and trees, we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, millions of years of evolution
and survival.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, you know, we know about
dragonflies.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, there's giant dragonfly
migrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: People should look up dragonfly
migrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: In some cases, dragonflies migrate 2,500
miles across whole oceans and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So other things do too, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that birds and different
things do have the potential to carry
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds, vases, you know, long distances,
especially if they catch a headwind or
[SPEAKER_07]: something, they find themselves a thousand
miles away in a few days.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think seeds can travel like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like that hypothesis of the
continuum from the landmass, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of curiosity?
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week on our psychedelic renaissance
course, it's a six-week course and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: the fifth week, the speaker was a guy
named Mark Plotkin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had never heard of Mark before,
but he is a student of Richard Schultes,
[SPEAKER_06]: who certainly is much more well-known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Richard Schultes was the Harvard
ethnobiologist who went down to the South
[SPEAKER_06]: America and Mexico and discovered all
these psychedelic use of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, including ayahuasca ceremony.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if it wouldn't have been for
Schultes' work, I don't think it would be
[SPEAKER_06]: as popular today as it truly is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Schultes was certainly a pioneer and
Mark Plotkin's got a podcast called Plants
[SPEAKER_06]: of the Gods, which I think is after
Richard Schultes' books that he wrote with
[SPEAKER_06]: Albert Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his podcast is extremely informative.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one thing, the reason why I
brought it up during this discussion is
[SPEAKER_06]: because it talks about ceremony and
ayahuasca ceremony and how it's connected
[SPEAKER_06]: to the culture and it's something that you
can't just necessarily reproduce and
[SPEAKER_06]: Berkeley, California in a clinic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it by Zoom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't translate very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all this work that Schultes did and
that now Plotkin has documented just shows
[SPEAKER_06]: how important it is to conserve this
biodiversity that exists down in what's
[SPEAKER_06]: left of the Amazon rainforest and
elsewhere, all other native areas that
[SPEAKER_06]: humans haven't deforested or completely
somehow changed the natural biology of
[SPEAKER_06]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm convinced there's the whole
treasure trove of chemistry and molecules
[SPEAKER_06]: down there in plant species we don't know
yet because it's funny, there's certainly
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely an awareness from the
indigenous cultures.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there's still cultures today that
exist today that have had no outside
[SPEAKER_06]: contact with the Western world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, to hear that, to know that
there are still cultures today that have
[SPEAKER_06]: not had contact with the Western world to
me, at least was fascinating to hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other thing is that just the areas
that they're living on are increasingly
[SPEAKER_06]: getting smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank God to these conservation
efforts, people like Mark Plotkin,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's involved in that whole Amazon
Conservation Society, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, again, a huge thing that's just
trying to keep as much of the biodiversity
[SPEAKER_06]: that we possibly can and learn it in a way
that doesn't totally exploit it
[SPEAKER_06]: commercially, but in a way where again,
we can understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's all kinds of clinical work
going on around DMT again, partially
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's one of the active ingredients
in Hiawaska, that coupled with the
[SPEAKER_06]: monoamine oxidase inhibitor, Harmaline.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's something that's happening
there that monomolecular medicine that
[SPEAKER_06]: we've talked about here on Hash Church
doesn't quite get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's things and there's clues that
these indigenous cultures have and the
[SPEAKER_06]: shaman know and they know and really
disease is a manifestation of some off
[SPEAKER_06]: balance between society and the
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've figured it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how ironic that, you know,
here we are in the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking to them for answers to solve
our problems and disease and hunger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to the shaman and we need
these places to basically still exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was in a clubhouse room the other
day again, where they were talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: clinical use of Hiawaska to treat,
you know, behavioral disorders.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just amazing that we're at that
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that that's a true,
you know, manifestation of like where the
[SPEAKER_06]: where the medicine comes from and what the
experience is all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think some shaman is just counting
some money because he just made a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of money by selling out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd be interested in what everybody
else thought on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, no, I.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's interesting how,
you know, it's it's partly the shamanism
[SPEAKER_07]: has been sort of marketed a little bit,
you know, so that's that maybe that's just
[SPEAKER_07]: a human thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it reminds me of Terrence McKenna and
Dennis McKenna and Wade Davies and Ethan
[SPEAKER_07]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Different people that have gone,
you know, made their life out of going to
[SPEAKER_07]: South America and trying to find plant
medicine and see how it can pertain to
[SPEAKER_07]: ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also psychedelic plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of Papua New Guinea and the
diversity on Papua New Guinea and all the
[SPEAKER_07]: tribes that live there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think these these tribes have allied
with diversity and they've allied with
[SPEAKER_07]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do have the key into the unknown.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know by by searching tombs and
using science, to find out about different
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds that are, say, on mummies or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they found cocaine on
mummies in Egypt where cocaine was
[SPEAKER_07]: probably from America.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would think for millions of years,
you know, these native cultures were in
[SPEAKER_07]: total contact with each other and probably
sharing medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, I don't think you can
really stop humans from from traveling
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like that there's a nature magic
still.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that we're in a modern world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can use science in a way that we
choose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like that there's still nature magic
out there that reminds us that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, nature is producing these
healing compounds, whether science proves
[SPEAKER_07]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so in some cases, our intuition
can lead us towards health.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why I feel we've dedicated our
life towards, you know, nature and natural
[SPEAKER_07]: healing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate you saying that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were recently given some ayahuasca
bark to take with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bite of ayahuasca bark with
psilocybin really changes the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_07]: experience of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I like that these medicines
are coming into our modern world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he was telling the story about I
forget the species of toad, but the toad
[SPEAKER_06]: that they look right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was showing a picture of that toad
to another tribe that was thousands of
[SPEAKER_06]: miles away and completely isolated from
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and and his his his contact there was
like, oh, we got a toad like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: This toad is from on the other side over
over near Peru by the coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't this goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a toad like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly, sure enough, this guy
showed them a toad that also produced the
[SPEAKER_06]: same kind of psychedelic effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they identified like a new species of
toad down there that they could lick.
[SPEAKER_06]: So crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like what else is out there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's got to be I mean,
I mean, and again, I think that if those
[SPEAKER_06]: cultures go away, if somehow the Western
civilization pollutes it just down there
[SPEAKER_06]: such that there's no more indigenous
culture, all that knowledge will go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is fundamental knowledge that has
been passed down for generations and
[SPEAKER_06]: generations and generations on how to live
in a multi, you know, use using all of
[SPEAKER_06]: these plants and fungi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's something wrong with you,
you go to the medicine man and he can make
[SPEAKER_06]: it better, whether it's a cut with an
infection or whether you got the fever or
[SPEAKER_06]: whether you got malaria.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have all the cures for
everything to live down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Paul Stamets is the speaker tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the last class.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the finale.
[SPEAKER_06]: They bring Paul in at the very end.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is our conversation because someone
mentioned this in chat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it was Fried Piper when we were
talking about the botany of desire who
[SPEAKER_10]: said Paul Stamets said that mushrooms are
probably cultivating us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure are, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure are actually very far off at all
because we're made up of trillions of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, trillions, 380, 380 trillion that
could possibly be pathogenic and the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: is sort of infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're made up of all of that,
then these are all thinking, living,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing, exudating, eating beings that
are highly intelligent because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: still here in numerous amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always say, you know, you might as
well join the microbe revolution because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot more of them than there are
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the other thought is that,
you know, everything that you're sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you know, people talk about
plastics and how it's bad for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes so long, but every single thing
that feeds us, every single thing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: like type on the fact that we're looking
through this computer, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, everything came from the
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that that's interesting
if we like take that mindscape and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: know that when we're gone, the
microbiology is going to proliferate and
[SPEAKER_00]: totally take care of that because the
earth is what made it of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: totally out of balance with humanity,
but still it's just a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that, you know, when you take
plant medicine seems to come up in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cerebral cortex of, you know,
a discussion to, to set the mind to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that it's really
interesting when we talk about closed
[SPEAKER_00]: loops and when we talk about the earth and
we talk about how we're all intermixed and
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and how science is related on
such a small microcosm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: point that we have to express and
something we have to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: explain, but it is just, it's such a wide
observational experience that's getting us
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's important that we
don't just doubt or let go of that in
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive observational experience that
we're having to help guide us to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a much better place than we're
in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have that ability and the plant
medicines continue to show us that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the rant, but it's big out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is going to degrade except for
fluoropolymers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what happens to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem to last forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fluoropolymers might be, yeah,
so Teflon, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dental floss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, billions and years from now,
the only thing that will exist from us is
[SPEAKER_06]: the Fukushima radiation and dental floss.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those will be our footprints.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Fukushima dental floss era.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only imagine how many times we've
gone through this cycle and don't even
[SPEAKER_10]: have any idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be an error, not an error?
Error.
[SPEAKER_07]: We learned from Paul's statements that
there was, I took this course on Cortez
[SPEAKER_07]: that it was, there's been five mass
extinctions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously he didn't make this up,
but he was teaching it to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: There had been five mass extinctions on
earth where you're like damn, you're wiped
[SPEAKER_07]: out all of life on earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last one I think was called the PT
extinction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what he was suggesting was that life
on earth came back from, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the BC coast area and that repopulated the
earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, maybe there's some more
there, but I like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: even during mass extinctions, the earth
repopulates itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Hopi, the Hopi have the same
prophecy that they say that this humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: is on its fifth stage of humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believe that we came out of the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was some kind of a big
cataclysmic event of heat or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that made it so the earth was inhabitable,
it makes sense that we would come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rocks and the ones that did survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a super interesting,
the prophecy rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: People can look up the prophecy rock down
at four corners in the Southwest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it talks about, you know, where
humanity goes and two different
[SPEAKER_07]: directions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it might be interesting that we're in
an area like that right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where there's just two types of things
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like the idea that we're,
you know, connecting with indigenous
[SPEAKER_07]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark, I'll let you say something again,
because I think that we can all take on
[SPEAKER_07]: getting local plants, you know,
and native plants back onto our property
[SPEAKER_07]: and bringing in more native plants into
our polyculture is really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And working on connecting with First
Nations and native cultures, even in North
[SPEAKER_07]: America, where we are at the moment,
you know, cultures, native all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: world are very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been recently contacted by GW's
Smoke Break and the family there to work
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Lakota, you know, in South
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and if that works out,
you know, it'd be amazing to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: collaborate with native peoples to bring,
you know, to help enhance their,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what they have to offer us
because in so many cases, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's been wiped out through residential
schools and reservations and all this
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a break down is still
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have the ability to still
retrieve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the retrieval of that
information is going to come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth because she's always been
interacting with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, if we think about that,
like we're interacting on certain levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and in certain time periods, but the earth
has always been interacting with humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: or with the planet or, I mean,
with the plants and the animals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some kind of a resonant,
everlasting, higher intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there for the taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the all knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally there for the taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: All we have to do is allow it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on that note, I believe we have to
take off and get our seeds planted.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to give so much thanks for the
people out there in the community doing
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we had a beautiful tour here in
British Columbia, and I think we should
[SPEAKER_07]: give thanks to a few people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kootenay's finest just became a micro
license here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big love to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, I really hope success for the
families here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really showing all of the work that
the community is doing here to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, step into the system to try to
make changes here, to make it so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy market still has a place and still
has a voice in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big ups to those guys who are doing
really amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes so much time, energy,
and money to finally achieve a license.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kootenay's finest has done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Che.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to Che at Rosebud.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at Rosebud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another outdoor LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out to his property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Kootenay vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing really good things for the community
and with his cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I've been talking to him lately.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that like Sarah's secret and stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: So wait, where's, we have some rosin from
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is just what I have in some
parchment here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Sarah's finest is looking really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sarah's secret, which is very fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is grown outdoors here in British
Columbia, here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a really beautiful outdoor
varietal that hashes really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can look forward to seeing some
good topicals and different things coming
[SPEAKER_07]: from that farm and the collective of co-op
here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been definitely talking.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been talking to Che.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been talking to Logan at Dunn.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been talking to just a few different
local, even Patrick his new LP.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been talking to those guys as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I of course want to support all the local
craft growers that are, that are,
[SPEAKER_10]: I basically want to support all the
growers that are getting to that level
[SPEAKER_10]: that are, that are at a point where it's
like, yes, this is, this is the,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is what the, what everyone needs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's make it accessible.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I'm really glad you shouted
those, those spots out and continue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Suzanne with white grizzly over in the
slow can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of the ladies in the slow can
totally in love with everything they've
[SPEAKER_07]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still carrying the vibes here in the
Kootenay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, still making it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also we're going out to plant
seeds because our big goal in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, and has been for a whole lot
of years, just to be planting fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable genetics that everybody in
Canada and Northern climates can just put
[SPEAKER_00]: in a small amount of soil and it grows
beautiful, amazing, dank flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really our focus and our goal
because we still really believe when you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own, you're getting the most
medicine out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having a beautiful relationship
with your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important as well as
you're getting out in your own backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, everybody in Canada,
you can plant your four, let's get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's plant your four and you can watch so
many hash churches on what to do with that
[SPEAKER_00]: four and how to turn it into amazing
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what all of these incredible
educators are here on this panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's really exercise that right of
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a couple more, Daniel and Brish,
Daniel and Brish with Earth Wolf Farms
[SPEAKER_07]: over in Lilloo with big love and support
to you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big love and support to Earth Wolf Farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to give up to, to Flav421
over on Sunshine, Joel, the whole family
[SPEAKER_07]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, I wanted to give a shout out to
Canonerd2 for bringing us this amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been hanging out with him,
a Sunshine Daydream, like a really old
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Sunshine Daydream from Bodie,
just a really long, blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I mean, like it's all that I
want to have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big ups to the really long flowering
patient growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Subsidium Secreto, you know,
Subsidium out from Ontario came and helped
[SPEAKER_07]: us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to give love.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really gave us a lot of help with
our, you know, hash life and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just huge love to the community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, you guys are amazing and so
intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the chat is just coming up
with great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can totally understand why it has
ebbs and flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're in a world of ebbs and
flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a-okay to all be
ourselves and just, you know, it's nice
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody gets here and is together
and just thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody for still hanging on to the
cannabis community, because we do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just appreciate you all more than
words can say, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be thinking about all of the
cannabis culture as I'm planting seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for all the inspiration
and the love and the guidance and
[SPEAKER_00]: education and expertise and pushing it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to push it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you all so, so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate you as well and have a great
day in the garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting those seeds into the, into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: King of the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually defining that because as
you know, I'm working with the Veterans
[SPEAKER_03]: Action Council and one of our members,
Michael Prouts, has been working at the
[SPEAKER_03]: United Nations and we're actually working
on submitting questions and our green
[SPEAKER_03]: paper to the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be submitting that to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing that this week,
but one of the things that we have found
[SPEAKER_03]: is that United Nations accepts cultures
and especially specific cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So across all treaties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to define the cannabis
culture, because as we know, it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: defined and we're trying to define it from
more of a world perspective as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: a U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, even though the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: has had its influence on the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: The culture of cannabis is worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we know, it crosses every
socioeconomic region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be very interesting to
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, we're we're going to be relying
on the culture at the U.N.
[SPEAKER_03]: level because the persecution of cannabis
has done nothing but help us perpetuate
[SPEAKER_03]: our own growing, growing cycle,
our processing, processing styles,
[SPEAKER_03]: how we ingest, how we use, pass it to the
left.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all these different situations,
you know, you come together, cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: seems rather communal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we come together in circles,
how it's produced, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be very interesting to
see as we challenge things culturally,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, there is a cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's definable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's actually malleable in shapes
from regional names, from genetics to even
[SPEAKER_03]: what cannabis is that have crossed I mean,
how many different generations,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if I say to Wade and,
you know, a skunk man, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I say a lid, they understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my generation doesn't know what a lid
is per se or why the term lid came from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cannabis in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just also fascinating how through
the ages from going back to the term
[SPEAKER_03]: muggles as opposed to other different
terminologies that have been cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: subsets that have crossed every boundary
around the world to continually maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look, even as a culture,
we all kind of gravitated and met where in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, because there's a huge cultural
cannabis there that was happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were, you know, growing,
judging, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those things that have continued to
spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cannabis wasn't the first one to
ever judge cannabis, but it was a cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: recognition spread out through a magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Et cetera, that drew us to a destination
where we all met and continued to
[SPEAKER_03]: perpetuate this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it also goes back to the discussion,
you know, did we perpetuate cannabis or
[SPEAKER_03]: did cannabis perpetuate us to proliferate
her as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: So just some interesting cultural
distinctions and understandings that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be pushing to try to liberate
things worldwide further and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trippy thoughts for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always in that cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we perpetuating it or is it
perpetuating us?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably a nice balance of the two,
no doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously that would depend on your
perspective, which seems to depend on your
[SPEAKER_10]: attitude.
[SPEAKER_10]: All these filters that we put in the way
to perceive, I guess that's what this
[SPEAKER_10]: experience is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all these filters and this five cents
prison that we seem to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And back in the day, we used to say who
are the grateful dead and why are they
[SPEAKER_06]: following me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the answer was.
[SPEAKER_10]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the next show?
[SPEAKER_10]: I like your answer better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we couldn't get good drugs
where we, I mean, you could get drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can get good drugs or the drugs
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you wouldn't believe the mushrooms
you find on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't believe the LSD they've got
on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it just drives drove
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, you know, sociologically
because of, you know, bad access.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're new into the drug
scene, you know, you're the old people in
[SPEAKER_03]: town don't know who the fuck you are and
aren't going to deal or deal with you per
[SPEAKER_03]: se.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things that are earned again,
culturally, how we even access or allow
[SPEAKER_03]: access to certain levels of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early on, we had access to shitty Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until we earned respect that we
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is kind of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, now this is the sellers of kind of
it down the street, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, imagine how many kids were like,
well, where where are we going to get the
[SPEAKER_10]: mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we'll get them on Shakedown Street.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shakedown Street.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, literally, one of my first
memories on Shakedown Street is this
[SPEAKER_03]: dreadlock hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walking up, holding this Amanita that was
literally this big, this huge tray,
[SPEAKER_03]: just mushrooms, mushroom, mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I found the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't I look, I didn't dig the music,
but I appreciated the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was always some bus at the
end with somebody with a huge chalkboard
[SPEAKER_03]: with somebody who was calling out from the
show like, OK, they just played this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would mark down on the
actual chalkboard what song had just
[SPEAKER_03]: played inside the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people could be outside the Shakedown
Street like, oh, wow, they're playing this
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it literally go around and then play
the song that was on from some other show
[SPEAKER_03]: that was recorded probably the night
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fucking trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've never.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was during during the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were out outside the venue in the
Shakedown Street area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: While the live Grateful Dead show was
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In like Oakland, the Oakland Coliseum and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't dig the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I dug the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the people, but, you know,
it just didn't carry it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like hardcore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jazz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in jazz in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciated the free flowingness of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the scene and the people that were
there, I mean, that was the only place I
[SPEAKER_03]: could literally be walking around,
tripping, see a guy pop open a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: Tupperware jar, just brimming with the
fattest fucking weed I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, hey, brother, can you spare a
bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he'd be like, sure,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just fucking chuck the bud right
fucking at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, thanks, bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like he went over to a tree at the end
of Shakedown Street, sat under the tree,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in the shade and just kind of
smoked a bud and tried to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No other place could I have done something
like that to be a fucking punk with my
[SPEAKER_03]: jacket and, you know, my tattoos and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Grateful Dead accepted us all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadheads are pretty friendly,
pretty open to anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't cause any problems,
you know, I mean, occasionally they'd get
[SPEAKER_06]: skinheads in there and they'd have to,
you know, have to have have issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the most part, yeah, it was a free
for all party.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you don't know what we're
talking about is before or during and
[SPEAKER_06]: after Grateful Dead concerts, they would
just have this traveling circus of many
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand people that would just come
around and make a living off of selling
[SPEAKER_06]: food and alcohol and shirts and frisbees
and bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: And crystals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you could sell it, I remember
seeing things like just lighters and
[SPEAKER_06]: papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you needed papers at a Grateful
Dead show, you went down to Shakedown
[SPEAKER_06]: Street.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some head shop down there that
was set up on the back of their Ford
[SPEAKER_06]: truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had all kinds of papers and
bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, you get glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see like Marvel Slinger and those guys
out on tour with their their, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy cases full of glass and,
you know, flashlight to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: sell pretty heavy pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it was a whole scene that kind
of developed around them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some cities, that was the reason
why the Grateful Dead weren't allowed to
[SPEAKER_06]: come back because they're like,
oh, my God, it's fucking travelist circus
[SPEAKER_06]: of drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, all the high school
kids in the area would catch, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: we could go to the Grateful Dead show,
stock up on all kinds of drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could basically buy acid and buy,
you know, all kinds of drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there would be all kinds of
problems for months after the Grateful
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead have left town because there's this
whole wake of, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so much fucking fun, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a wake of freedom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was it was a real life adventure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, way before it got really
big, like I started seeing him in the late
[SPEAKER_06]: 70s and like they were still on like
Saturday Night Live.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there the night that John Belushi
came out on stage and sang with him for a
[SPEAKER_06]: song before that was in 1980.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it was just back then in
the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a big thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people didn't really know about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like you'd go to an arena and you'd be
able like like ATM was saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd be able to smoke weed in an arena
normally where if you were at a rock
[SPEAKER_06]: concert, they'd bust your ass for smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a different set of rules for
when the Grateful Dead came to town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill Graham and the other promoters would
say, hey, man, this group, if you just let
[SPEAKER_06]: them smoke their weed, they're just going
to, you know, they're not going to bust
[SPEAKER_06]: chairs or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just want to watch the music and come
and go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I remember being at Almond
Brothers show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at Neil Young shows and other shows
where I had like a little one hitter and
[SPEAKER_06]: some guy was giving me the flashlight all
night, you know, and you could be at a
[SPEAKER_06]: Grateful Dead show and just be smoking
just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that's the beauty of Vancouver
because all shows in Vancouver are a
[SPEAKER_10]: Grateful Dead show in regards to smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll never forget the last time I was
smoking joints, which was a fair while
[SPEAKER_10]: ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Neil Young play a solo show.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Queen Elizabeth Theater and I rolled
like 20 huge fat joints and I wrote the
[SPEAKER_10]: names of my favorite 20 Neil Young songs
on those joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was sitting in like the sixth row on
the floor, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like in the Queen Elizabeth Theater in
Vancouver, which is a pretty awesome
[SPEAKER_10]: venue.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I smoked one of those joints each time
he he did another song.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I ended up smoking like 14 of
the 20.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started by the time the song was over,
the joint was still going.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd have to pass that one down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it just him solo, Marcus, or did he
have a band with a solo with about six to
[SPEAKER_10]: eight acoustic guitars, a standout piano,
a banjo and feel like I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, a baby grand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely a couple of shows worth
checking out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was two nights at the Queen Elizabeth
Theater.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to say it was like 96 or 97
maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the Allman Brothers the same year at
the same venue.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was also a unbelievable,
wonderful experience of just mass,
[SPEAKER_10]: mass puffing in a super beautiful old
school venue where everything's like sort
[SPEAKER_10]: of inspirational.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, all the chairs are like red
velour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not it's not it's not a
caricature, but I used to smell that herb
[SPEAKER_06]: at the Grateful Dead show and say,
that's herb, not this Mexican brown shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I remember getting Acapulco go back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it definitely had a definitely a
different flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like many deadhead kids who are out on
tour, we started smoking NorCal grown weed
[SPEAKER_06]: out on Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was no going back.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh, my God, this is just a
higher grade of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first time I smoked blonde hash
was out on Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to always get like the red
Lebanese or the dark stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember getting stuff where you could
still see the stamp or the imprint of the
[SPEAKER_06]: hash, like the Turkish hash, you know,
in the New York metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first time I had smoked blonde
hash was out on Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this quarantine's got us missing
concerts, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to cut it short today.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have eight more minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to let everyone know that my
son's down at the field playing soccer and
[SPEAKER_10]: he's wanting Dada to come down and kick
the ball around.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what what could you imagine being
better than after a couple of hours of
[SPEAKER_10]: hanging out with you guys and puffing
bowls and enjoying some great dialogue?
[SPEAKER_10]: I get to go outside and run around with my
six and a half year old son who's just
[SPEAKER_10]: starting to get kind of cool with soccer.
[SPEAKER_10]: He wasn't really understanding before,
but now he can run and kick the ball.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you just I can see why
pride is one of the seven deadly sins,
[SPEAKER_10]: not that I'm like super religious and
follow the Bible, but be careful with that
[SPEAKER_10]: shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: The love you have for your kids is
blinding.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's it's the reason why you're a
parent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just it's the best treasure that
you have for all the headaches and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: sweating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're worried about, again,
bringing someone into the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think being a parent is the best thing
you could do in this life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, my kid just turned 24 years old,
man, and to see him out in he's in the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry, Marcus, and he's out making hash
and making a good name for himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he got himself a modulus base.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to those of you who are parents,
I guess it's something again that you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't relate to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that that unconditional love
that you get from your children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a good reason they might want
you to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, because if it's not us good parents
having children who will have the children
