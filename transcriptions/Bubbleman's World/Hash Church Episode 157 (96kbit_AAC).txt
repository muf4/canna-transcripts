[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of Hash Church,
episode 157.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one week after our three-year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some may say that today is the three-year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you would like to celebrate it as
such, by all means, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I'm going to send out
some links to our panelists, or at least
[SPEAKER_03]: to this week's panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a good old chat room happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of, oh, 105, 107 people watching,
and 148.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, the numbers jumping quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to put my headphones in,
as I'm probably going to be causing some
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of a feedback loop, as I always do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just make sure that I'm getting the
right links out to everyone so that they
[SPEAKER_03]: all have the right link to click.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Etienne has already seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if he's going to come in and
make his way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you were missed for the three-year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in New Orleans, so it was impossible
to really do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice that you got out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a nice three years, so
congratulations as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Needless to say, on a great three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, wasting no time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Etienne is already in on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, nice squish, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that pretty thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this here is the Seedman Haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What temp was that pressed at?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pressed around 200 degrees on the
Sasquatch M1.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, very nice squish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What temp?
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just around 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it was a little bit higher and
we dropped the temp, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it did that dual butter and also a nice
drip there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took some macro photographs earlier,
so I figured it might be the way to go
[SPEAKER_06]: about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got my Bubble Man vaporizer,
fortunately, before my trip and was able
[SPEAKER_06]: to use it on my trip, which was very
helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kudos on your latest accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Needless to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude, I'm glad that you got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That put a smile on my face to see that
you had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that Forest also posted one the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony's getting them out to all the right
people, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also able because I ran out a little
bit on my trip, so I was able to put my
[SPEAKER_06]: own wax in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, as opposed to the rosin,
so I had a little learning curve with that
[SPEAKER_06]: because the BHO, when it's heated,
tends to expand, so you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that the lids on it, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I finally did it, it cooked down,
but it definitely it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so this is for Ontario.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's asking me to show dry sift and
bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you go, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three different grades of dry sift
separated out from one full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: hash in the bottom of the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be looking forward to Ontario
hashish posting his dry sift and bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: that he's going to be showing us in the
Facebook room later today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look forward to seeing that Monsieur
Ontario hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, why don't we smoke
some hashish?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that we're doing picture time
and sharing, I think Etan's already like
[SPEAKER_03]: five bowls in, and I need to join the
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what's going on with the
rest of our crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe today it's you and I.
[SPEAKER_06]: C'est la vie.
[SPEAKER_03]: C'est la vie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm happy, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a whole hash church with you
today, Etan, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not like we don't have anything
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between you and me, I think that we'll
probably be able to find enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, needless to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of things are happening here
in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new regulations still kind of
digesting those.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the governor signed the AB 133 the
other day, which allows for colocations
[SPEAKER_06]: amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an emergency situation that
has transpired because it's not like the
[SPEAKER_06]: state of California was dragging its feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that time is getting away from
them and that January 1st, they want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to issue permits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So local municipalities are still racing
to get people into their systems and local
[SPEAKER_06]: people are trying to get into their local
systems or get their local municipalities
[SPEAKER_06]: to change laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're still in that neophyte phase as
opposed to watching all the exciting
[SPEAKER_06]: things happening up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still so draconian and still in the
individual state status as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_06]: inter-province love that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but we got a nightmare of a scene in
a way too because there's this major,
[SPEAKER_03]: major division that still occurs in our
federal and in our non-federal system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once they figure it out and offer us
everything we need, because obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not offering us everything we
need, therefore we have to continue with
[SPEAKER_03]: civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're not going to allow all the
extracts and all these different things,
[SPEAKER_03]: then people are forced to produce them and
sell them through dispensaries and other
[SPEAKER_03]: means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what Canada's continuing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully they'll figure out at one
point how to get rid of this sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition problem in regards to trying
to pass it over to a legal system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in California, we've very fortunately
have Laurie Ajax, who's the former head of
[SPEAKER_06]: the alcohol control board.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the one that's been assigned or the
initial for the marijuana control and
[SPEAKER_06]: we're very fortunate that they've been
holding meetings all over the state and
[SPEAKER_06]: that they are open and listening to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fortunately we don't have to protest at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to actually see that everything
that we get, there's still the issue of
[SPEAKER_06]: the 100 milligram limit on edibles and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are edibles allowed by the federal
government there in Canada?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you allowed to produce edibles or is
that just like flowers and extracts?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you allowed to produce?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for my own personal, I can produce
every type of extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from the MMAR.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from the court case that Owen Smith
went through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael's not seeing the panel today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because there is no panel today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's myself and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the panel today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are cooking it up early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have your vaporizers ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even hit a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have something to say,
let me mute my mic and heat this court.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the banger that fits in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's the adapter that fits in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes a mini so much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But California is, you know, we're really
pushing for proper regulations and
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide testing, which of course is we
just had a major release by another one by
[SPEAKER_06]: Steep Hill saying that over 90% of the
clones on the market are contaminated,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is, well, it shows that the market
needs for somebody who's watching,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they need to get on their game
and start producing and get in the,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, mother and clone game because
genetics are needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a major issue if you're
perpetuating a problem and selling clones
[SPEAKER_06]: to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm doing it right now because the
suppliers that I have, I thought were
[SPEAKER_06]: clean, but it turns out that, you know,
that's not necessarily always the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the difficult things about not
being vertically integrated, because my
[SPEAKER_06]: city hasn't allowed for that vertical
integration yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So by not having a clean supply of clones
or clean genetics to start with,
[SPEAKER_06]: as we've talked about multiple times,
it's you're basically giving people a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem to start with out the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's only a problem that they're going
to find because we found that these
[SPEAKER_06]: wonderful and growing environments that we
recreate insides are the perfect
[SPEAKER_06]: environments for nature to thrive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nature will find its way in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, starting off with an
automatic contaminant, be it something in
[SPEAKER_06]: the roots or something like white powdery
mildew, et cetera, you're already behind
[SPEAKER_06]: the eight ball because as soon as you grow
it, the problem is going to show itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to think that it was your
problem or something that you did in your
[SPEAKER_06]: room or in your environment that may have
caused it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in reality, it's starting off with the
plant that you're bringing in and the
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect growing environment that you're
setting for the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're creating those perfect conditions,
unfortunately, to host and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: deal with those situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know Sam has talked about in the
past, you know, when waste to get around
[SPEAKER_06]: this is to get solid genetics that are
seeds and start from there if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: unable to find.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only that, but I would strongly
suggest use varieties which are resistant
[SPEAKER_10]: to powdery mildew or whatever the specific
problem is that you have.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll find, you know, a great difference
in resistance between actorial varieties
[SPEAKER_10]: and white leaf varieties to powdery
mildew, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it literally is what you start with
can affect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ways that we have found this,
at least myself, I've grown little areas
[SPEAKER_06]: with starter plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to see which ones get white
powdery mildew or not, because it's very
[SPEAKER_06]: prevalent here in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's easier to get white powdery mildew
than most things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can actually start to see
through and pull out those plants that are
[SPEAKER_06]: susceptible to white powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you will see plants or,
you know, equatorials tend to have that
[SPEAKER_06]: natural defense so that you can literally
see a plant that's covered in white
[SPEAKER_06]: powdery mildew right next to another plant
that has white powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, oh, that doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how we go through that type of
selection if you don't have access to a
[SPEAKER_06]: good seed stock or a geneticist who knows
that this, in fact, is what it says it's
[SPEAKER_06]: to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because most...
[SPEAKER_10]: The real problem is that anything with
white leaf varieties, genetics in it from
[SPEAKER_10]: Afghanistan or the Hindu Kush,
that general area, they have no natural
[SPEAKER_10]: resistance for powdery mildew because the
conditions there are not conducive to
[SPEAKER_10]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas equatorial varieties, they had to
have resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's been biologically built into
the plant through...
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're the only ones, they're the
ones that were reproduced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem is, is that the most
popular strains, like your cookies and
[SPEAKER_06]: your OG cushions and things like that,
tend to be from the upper mountain regions
[SPEAKER_06]: and tend to be widely varieties and highly
susceptible to white powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's an issue that's kind of come
from the consumer because of consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: demand, but not necessarily from the
growers and the growers demands from where
[SPEAKER_06]: the growers are growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I mean, as far as I know,
white powdery mildew is a problem all over
[SPEAKER_06]: the United States and into North America.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure about... It's a problem
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you don't see it very much from
fields, crops in Afghanistan because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: dry there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, but in general, wherever
there's... I'm sure there are some which
[SPEAKER_10]: do get powdery mildew even in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome Dr. Mark and Skunk Pan Sam as
well to the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just Etienne and myself for a few
minutes there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Wade is in the house with his
smiley face.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, Wade?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful sunny day, garden is
flourishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw your photos with forest and the
Swami and I was like... That was a fun
[SPEAKER_03]: visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looked like a fun visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little bit of rain on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Swami is doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real treat to see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: His plants are struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's transitioning from working in pots to
working in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he's so fervent about using no
animal products, nitrogen is a real issue
[SPEAKER_02]: for his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we explored what possibilities
there were to increase the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: without adding any fish emulsion or any of
the other things that a lot of folks use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meantime, he's very meticulous about
organic and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were some of the alternatives that
you guys were talking about for producing
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen for his plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Green manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not willing to use animal manures of
any kind in compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cover crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: That takes a while, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing that he could think of would
be using the seed meal of high protein
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds, for example, hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And pressed it for oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could use that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is fairly high in carbon and I'm sure
it's high in what you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, Sam, I bet you it
would put a smile on Swami's face.
Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as he didn't have to squash the
billion seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a source for that, Sam,
that you know of that you could name?
[SPEAKER_10]: In Canada, probably Marcus knows better
than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US, there really isn't anybody
squishing yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my, I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some friends doing things in
Nebraska, et cetera, but they're more
[SPEAKER_06]: dealing in decorricators.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be an oil company producing
oil in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd think like Nativa or somebody like
that would be somebody to reach out to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nativa is California.
[SPEAKER_06]: So reach out to them and see what they're
doing with their.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Europe, what they do with the seed
after they squash it is they make it into
[SPEAKER_10]: animal feed really high in protein.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's high protein.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the animals love it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they, they will gravitate toward
it when they're have different types of
[SPEAKER_06]: protein for some reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, you know, it's very good for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's digestible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the room, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I wanted to give thanks to Forrest
once again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that hashtag that you
started, uh, make them watch and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that whole mentality behind it and the
words that you wrote prior to that
[SPEAKER_03]: hashtag, which I shared on my Facebook
page was, uh, that was powerful shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I have a unique perspective and
I just share have nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think a lot of the cannabis
industry and for good reason, this isn't a
[SPEAKER_08]: judgment, but they've had to just tip toe
around all these judgmental people,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and all their reasons why the
cannabis industry is bad and evil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even in our own community,
you know, there's just, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're putting up with ridiculous
regulation that they really don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: choice because they've just been abused
and mistreated for so many years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But see, I'm not in that circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't have something to prove
or to sell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have nothing to lose to call people
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and really point out how they're,
you know, they're these old ideologies
[SPEAKER_08]: that they can't point back to any reason
why they even believe them other than they
[SPEAKER_08]: were told at some point they should,
how they impact everybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that post was one of many that
just, I feel is my role to just really put
[SPEAKER_08]: it in people's faces that we're at a point
now where if you are going to hold on to
[SPEAKER_08]: old.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideologies and outdated beliefs that put
people's lives at risk and severely impact
[SPEAKER_08]: community members, quality of life.
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't be protected in your little
bubble and not have to see the damage that
[SPEAKER_08]: causes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where the make them watch
hashtag came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should see what it looks like to
watch a child slowly seize to death.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should see what it's like to suffer
from conditions where your skin fall off.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should see what it's like for a
cancer patient to go through chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_08]: with and without access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the only way you can have these
outdated really, you know, callous and
[SPEAKER_08]: heartless to be blunt positions is if you
can shelter yourself from the impact that
[SPEAKER_08]: has on people around you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage families and patients out
there who are suffering to film it and
[SPEAKER_08]: post it and tag it with the, make them
watch so that they can see the real impact
[SPEAKER_08]: that cannabis prohibition has.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And prior, prior, prior to that statement,
you, you posted a photo of Silas May 20th,
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly heavy, not looking as healthy on
pharmaceuticals back to September 17th,
[SPEAKER_03]: like lost major weight, looks just so much
more aware and healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you wrote, you know, don't tell me
that we as parents do not know what is and
[SPEAKER_03]: is not safe for our children.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to live with the consequences of
the pills we've given our child every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: 95% seizure free, 100% pharmaceutical
free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was also very powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote that and sort of, I wrote that to
the people who are very consistent in
[SPEAKER_03]: their, well, we need more proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the proof?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more scientific document,
documentation, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Forrest says in the last
sentence of his statement here and what
[SPEAKER_03]: you said, you know, don't tell me that we
as parents don't know what is safe and not
[SPEAKER_03]: safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was, that, that predated
the, uh, make them watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just thought both of them were like
crack right out of the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's where it all started was with
patients because remember it was the AIDS
[SPEAKER_06]: patients and people suffering here in the
Bay area that got so sick and tired of
[SPEAKER_06]: literally watching on their friends
wasting away and dying that they're like,
[SPEAKER_06]: fuck you, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to break the fucking law.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it was not for them, we would not
be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of gotten to a stagnation
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what you're doing there
Forrest is touting a whole other level
[SPEAKER_06]: because we were able to open up that first
wave, but at the same time it's opened up
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole other wave of medicines to these
very intricate, delicate, um, illnesses
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're dealing with that are on the
very rare side of the realities.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not common things like depression
or unfortunately AIDS and other things
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so narrowly along a finite point
that they, you've literally been ignored
[SPEAKER_06]: by everything from the pharmaceutical
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trying doctors who are desperately
trying to find any way to find any type by
[SPEAKER_06]: their standards that they have access to,
you know, discarded even at TN.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think your awareness and your
ability to raise awareness because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: difficulties that you face and the
connection that those vulnerabilities have
[SPEAKER_06]: with the everyday person really becomes
its own arrow point and spear.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's own trajectory that I think will
do nothing but help millions of people and
[SPEAKER_06]: especially thousands of children with
these rare conditions that can get some
[SPEAKER_06]: relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some relief is better than no relief,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if it's temporary, you know,
it's the same here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to say that it really was the
sort of the gay community who are the
[SPEAKER_03]: first to stand up and just be like,
and it was, it was a part of the gay
[SPEAKER_03]: community who was suffering with AIDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was this wasteland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was this whole thing of the HIV testing
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all of these different things
that cannabis just seemed to be miraculous
[SPEAKER_03]: for in how it was improving the quality of
a life that was being decimated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hung around, you know, in the
beginning of the BC Compassion Club with
[SPEAKER_03]: Hillary, the majority of the people that
she signed originally were terminally ill.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, it was really almost like
palliative care she was offering,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were also homeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were, you know, it was just,
it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first, you know, we should never
forget that group of people and how they
[SPEAKER_03]: really were the front lines for,
you know, here on the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think pretty consistently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were ostracized by everything and by
everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody didn't know how AIDS was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't until Princess Diana actually
shook the hand of an AIDS patient in a
[SPEAKER_06]: hospital in like 1985 that people
realized, oh, I'm not going to catch this
[SPEAKER_06]: this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it was originally just
dismissed as a gay disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of that, the, you know,
AIDS were not necessarily looked proper
[SPEAKER_06]: upon by society as much as necessarily
they are and respectfully are now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had to literally come out and
fight for their freedoms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and then they pulled society,
all of us together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got great respect for the gay
community for their hard work,
[SPEAKER_06]: their dedication, their networking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: They taught us in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought we knew networking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no idea how to network until we saw
the gay community come out in the AIDS and
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they showed us how it's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: People we thought we straights had it
going on, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we had no clue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their networks before internet,
et cetera, et cetera, were a class that we
[SPEAKER_06]: all envied because of how able and how
quickly they were able to organize and get
[SPEAKER_06]: it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much respect to all those pioneers and
those survivors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And needless to say, much love and respect
to all those who passed away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those family members who had to suffer
along the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, some of the most inspired
activists I've worked with started,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, in Los Angeles and other areas
with working with the gay community during
[SPEAKER_08]: the AIDS epidemic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the stories are just
heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's more heart, well, more is
probably the wrong word, but what is also
[SPEAKER_08]: heartbreaking is the fact that,
um, community didn't rise up to support,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, just like you're saying they
shunned them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had all this judgment towards
homosexuality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, you look back on that and
people look back on it with shame,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the people who have a good,
you know, moral compass, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we're, we're just the humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just have to repeat this history,
you know, and we're at this point now
[SPEAKER_08]: where the word medicine and how it
pertains to cannabis, the doors have been
[SPEAKER_08]: blown wide open.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I had always thought like,
yeah, this is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is harmless.
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps people get hungry.
[SPEAKER_08]: This wonderful, you know, there is
absolutely no moral or ethical reason to
[SPEAKER_08]: prevent these people.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we're on the cusp of, you know,
slowly discovering, but rapidly in the
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of medical understanding,
discovering that it is interacting with
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the most important regulatory
systems in our body and could hold the key
[SPEAKER_08]: to some of the most important medical
discoveries we've seen in generations and
[SPEAKER_08]: went from this is harmless.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, this can help.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the right thing to do to this is
without a doubt, one of the greatest
[SPEAKER_08]: medical discoveries of our lifetime and
has the potential to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: The world and anyone who's saying that the
studies, you know, there just needs to be
[SPEAKER_08]: more research.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as I hear that come out of my
mouth, I know I'm talking to someone who
[SPEAKER_08]: has made little to no effort to look at
the research that's available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at this point, the only way you
can say there's no research or more needs
[SPEAKER_08]: to happen is that you've locked yourself
in a bubble or are just repeating mantras
[SPEAKER_08]: that you've heard other people say,
and you're hoping that they're true
[SPEAKER_08]: because we have human clinical trials in
this country.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, peer reviewed papers coming out
every other day at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't even keep up with the science
that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's just at this point,
one of my main goals is that exact concept
[SPEAKER_08]: of people protecting themselves in this
bubble by saying, well, we didn't really
[SPEAKER_08]: know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't really understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things I try to do every
time I speak or if I've made a conference
[SPEAKER_08]: or if I'm talking to anyone is that when
we're done talking, you're no longer going
[SPEAKER_08]: to get to say you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to know and you're going
to either act on it and look back and
[SPEAKER_08]: realize that you acted with pride and
with, you know, with a good moral compass,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to look back on it and
realize that you, you know, put a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people in a really dangerous position that
could cost a lot of people their lives for
[SPEAKER_08]: really no justifiable reason at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the problem is, is that
people are so easily manipulated and
[SPEAKER_03]: directed and, you know, they're just and
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about people that are,
you know, brainwashed by a particular type
[SPEAKER_03]: of religion or people like I'm not talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, belief systems in generally
allow humans to be manipulated easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a perfect example is these anarchists
that go around to different events.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like to show up at the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like to go to like the end games of
baseball and football and basketball and
[SPEAKER_03]: hockey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they do is they start riots.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start riots with just normal good
people that are out enjoying a football
[SPEAKER_03]: game or a soccer game or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these motherfuckers show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the tear gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the gas masks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you know they're there to start
riots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're like, did you notice there
was guys with gas masks on?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, dude, they brought those
gas masks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do all this little fuckery and they
do a little push here and a little push
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next thing you know, everyday
normal people are flipping and burning cop
[SPEAKER_03]: cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it in my own city twice when the
Vancouver Canucks lost the playoffs for
[SPEAKER_10]: the Stanley Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Marcus, these people are not doing
this for their own reasons.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're for the revolution, the
revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, well, I mean, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just say one more final thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is something we all have to
combat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we, you know, before we move on
from this topic is that it's not just that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're easily manipulated, but we also
have this like inert need to protect our
[SPEAKER_08]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this need to just protect our
world view and paradigm, whether it's
[SPEAKER_08]: right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't adapt to change very well as
animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, there's this whole cognitive
dissonance built in function into the
[SPEAKER_08]: human brain that is, I don't know,
there must be some sort of protection
[SPEAKER_08]: mechanism where it was beneficial to us at
one time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now at this point, you know,
with that information coming at us in ways
[SPEAKER_08]: it never has in human history,
it doesn't serve us very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have this need to just protect
ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes it's harmless and benign,
you know, and sometimes it's, it's very
[SPEAKER_08]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think this is one of the
things we can do is really, I try to watch
[SPEAKER_08]: that in myself, you know, like,
is this something that I want to believe,
[SPEAKER_08]: or is this something that I know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I try to point that out with people
that we're talking to in ways that are
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully not challenging to them
personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not attacking the person.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just trying to get them to
understand where their own ideas have even
[SPEAKER_08]: come from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we adopt so much that it's just
becomes our personal identity that is
[SPEAKER_08]: really just handed to us through our
culture, in our communities, through
[SPEAKER_08]: television, through, you know,
radio and pop culture influences and
[SPEAKER_08]: school friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we just adopt pieces of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at some point when we're challenged,
you know, it's really good that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: making sure we're looking back on this and
saying, okay, am I holding onto this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's just something I've always
believed and I'm not sure why,
[SPEAKER_08]: or is this something that I have good
foundation to adopt as part of me and part
[SPEAKER_08]: of what I'm advocating for?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see with cannabis, it's all falls
under that category because all the
[SPEAKER_08]: arguments that you hear are really not
backed up with much of anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's just things that people
have been raised to believe and have been
[SPEAKER_08]: told and have been, are still continuing
to be repeated, like the harmful effects
[SPEAKER_08]: on, you know, development or brains and
kids and all these things that we've just,
[SPEAKER_08]: you go back and look at the research and
there's very little, if any support of
[SPEAKER_08]: evidence, but people just adopted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really good for people in the
cannabis activism realm to recognize that
[SPEAKER_08]: and to be able to provide information in a
way that helps people like shift ideas
[SPEAKER_08]: without triggering that, that need to
protect their worldview, which just shuts
[SPEAKER_08]: down their ears completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we in the, in the can days when my
activist road days, we learned early that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's all about planting seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Planting seeds in their minds,
because you can't change someone's
[SPEAKER_06]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you can give them this piece
of information or this link to this
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge, so that they themselves can
then go to that link themselves in their
[SPEAKER_06]: own time when they're ready for it and
they're ready to absorb it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they actually look at it and
actually read it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It affects the collective unconsciousness,
not only themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those planting seeds, as we said,
it was back then it was having a pamphlet
[SPEAKER_06]: and getting to somebody's pants and hoping
that they forgot to wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: They forgot about that in their pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then their mom goes through their
pants and then pulls out that piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: paper and goes, Hey, what's this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sparks that discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: It engages people and forces them to have
these uncomfortable conversations that
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't want to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some reason, because as you
stated, the collective conscious has
[SPEAKER_06]: taught them this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they can't go against that because
of change.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you can give them the idea and it
has to come from themselves and it has to
[SPEAKER_06]: be instigated by themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can give them the seed that can
sit in there and give them time in time
[SPEAKER_06]: will form its own manure and break down
and start to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it starts to grow, it becomes
their idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that change can come from within
them, from their own instigation,
[SPEAKER_06]: as opposed to us try to beat it over their
heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I realize we going out there,
we can only reach a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is always for every one person at a
rally back in the 90s, there was 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_06]: to 20 people at home because they were
afraid to come out or show their face,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, et cetera, which now become the
standard reality of people being filmed at
[SPEAKER_06]: rallies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back then, it wasn't the case,
but it was still the fear.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it became that reality consciously.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to, again, plant our own seeds
so that it can sprout and teach others
[SPEAKER_06]: through our own education and passing that
knowledge on to them so that they can
[SPEAKER_06]: judge and grow for themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't agree more, but I would just
add one last thing, which is I found there
[SPEAKER_08]: is one way to make a direct and immediate
paradigm shift in someone and that's with
[SPEAKER_08]: direct experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've had, we've worked with
lawmakers where we've had kids there and
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like, I don't know, we need more
research, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Bam, child has a seizure and their idea on
what is and what is not appropriate
[SPEAKER_08]: changes immediately because we have a
reaction that then, you know, changes our,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it changes us physiologically.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when we have this, you know,
almost maternal sense through this
[SPEAKER_08]: reaction to parent paternal sense,
when we see people have these experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen people change immediately.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's one of the reasons I think we I'd
like to see more integration of people who
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of the community thinks we should
protect from cannabis integrated with
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see children in gardens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see children at farms and
interacting and showing that this plant is
[SPEAKER_08]: not going to reach out and grab them and,
you know, rip them from limb to limb that
[SPEAKER_08]: the perceived harm is really just that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's it's it's fear without a without
reasoning in the basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is also and this can bring us
back to where Marcus started us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we need to move on, then that's
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's also the idea behind the make
them watch hashtag people change through
[SPEAKER_08]: direct experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want them to see what it's like for
people to have a seizure, adult or child,
[SPEAKER_08]: but see the fear in the parents eyes,
see the pain, experience the trauma.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not quite as effective,
but it still has more impact than just
[SPEAKER_08]: verbal dialogue when they have to see it
and experience it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're uncomfortable and they don't
want to watch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That has an impact on the mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we can change hearts and minds
that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's hard because a lot of people
don't want to share that pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: That personal pain and struggling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they shouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no other medical condition where
you have to expose your suffering that way
[SPEAKER_08]: publicly to prove that you have it and
maintain access.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with cannabis right now, I think we
need to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it really directly impacts
exactly what you were saying as far as
[SPEAKER_08]: people's ability to change their
perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how we change communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when they understand what happens
is I've seen it, then they say,
[SPEAKER_08]: well, we are all for these kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know that's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids with seizures, that helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all agree they should have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's this mental disconnect that,
you know, it's just going to spring out of
[SPEAKER_08]: thin air and then families are going to
have access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, we want them to have it,
but we just don't want it grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we don't want it in our communities
because we might smell it for six weeks
[SPEAKER_08]: out of a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that's part of a lot of the
work I'm doing is really trying to focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on, well, these are not mutually exclusive
ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be able to understand that if
you want to and protect these vulnerable
[SPEAKER_08]: members in your community or adult or
child, then it has to grow somewhere and
[SPEAKER_08]: it has to be tested somewhere and it has
to be manufactured somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the angle I take into these
local community fights in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just every county is fighting
tooth and nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems like they're all arguing like
it's 2008 still, you know, or 2005 like,
[SPEAKER_08]: well, we should have setbacks and we don't
know if we want it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just the wrong conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to allow my board of
supervisors or local officials to even
[SPEAKER_08]: have that type of conversation in 2008.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with the amount of undisputable
scientific evidence that has shown this is
[SPEAKER_08]: life saving medication, you no longer get
to say, you know, or choose if we want it
[SPEAKER_08]: in our communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a choice that is an option.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get to choose if we're going to
have insulin for kids who need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get to choose even if we're
going to have opioids and opioids are
[SPEAKER_08]: killing people by the millions,
but it would be considered completely
[SPEAKER_08]: unethical to say you can't have morphine
after you have heart surgery or you have
[SPEAKER_08]: an amputation of a leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that these things are not up for
debate as far as human rights.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with cannabis, for some reason,
we're still debating it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's a if type of question,
like, oh yeah, it's just some people like
[SPEAKER_08]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are we going to allow that in our
community or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: But that conversation is over.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no longer OK to say if we're going to
have it in our communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only ethical question is how are we
going to do it and how are we going to do
[SPEAKER_08]: it in a way that protects our communities
and protects the most vulnerable there?
[SPEAKER_08]: So all right, I'm off my soapbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an awesome soapbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you said in that it's a very
important perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said for a long time now that
it's definitely going to be the children,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately, because we really shouldn't
have to be exposing sick children.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the thing that changes the
minds of the most staunch prohibitionist,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one who's just swallowed the pill.
[SPEAKER_03]: He believes in all the all the propaganda.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a half a second, you can see that
change with exactly what you described,
[SPEAKER_03]: someone having a seizure right in front of
them and then being relieved with a drop
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It no longer just changes their mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It changes their soul for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Close them to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you can see it in that
representative city council person,
[SPEAKER_06]: county person, et cetera's eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they need to be shocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to see the horror of these kids
whose skin cannot basically stay on and
[SPEAKER_06]: that this medicine literally holds them
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, their shock, their shock as well
is is the real shock.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real shock has to be how could I have
been led down such an evil path?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you notice that in that
instant and you see that, like Forrest
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned, the fear in the parents eyes,
the real experience of it happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm guaranteeing you nine point
nine out of 10 would stand there with
[SPEAKER_03]: their jaw on the floor, unable to really
process what was happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I share these pictures of
these E.B.
[SPEAKER_08]: kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and they can be graphic, you know,
that's it's hard to look at.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let me tell you, I know you guys have
seen it, but some watching might not have.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to the Colladrius Network on
Instagram or on Facebook, you can see some
[SPEAKER_08]: of these pictures and they're the most
mild pictures I have to share there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to not intentionally exploit
your posts, gory photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a file the parents have sent me
that I just don't know if people are ready
[SPEAKER_08]: to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to scare people off.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you look at those pictures of those
E.B.
[SPEAKER_08]: kids, realize you're seeing the most tame
pictures I can try to show to get the
[SPEAKER_08]: point across without making people not
want to come back because it's horrific
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you say the condition?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the condition is called
epidermolysis bullosa B-U-L-L-O-S-A.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, if you want to, you know,
have your paradigm shifted, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_08]: Google that and see what those kids go
through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is the root cause of this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a single cause?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a genetic malformation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a genetic fluke where their
body doesn't produce the protein.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a protein that holds our layers of
skin together, like Velcro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you don't produce that,
the layers of skin slide on each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you bump it hard enough,
then it starts the blistering process.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just like a burn, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It blisters and then peels off and dies
and tries to heal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But your body never stops doing that,
which is why they call them butterfly
[SPEAKER_08]: kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the parents don't like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They like to call them like turtle kids
because they're tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the term is like they call them
butterfly kids because their skin is so
[SPEAKER_08]: soft that when you bump it, it comes off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've seen huge improvements in their
ability to heal and regenerate skin
[SPEAKER_08]: quickly and get them off the other
medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, some of the damage and
this goes back to what Marcus said about
[SPEAKER_08]: the pictures of Silas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've hurt my son treating his condition,
but it wasn't with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've given him drugs that I, it's hard to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hold so much regret for giving him for
such a long amount of time, horrible drugs
[SPEAKER_08]: from our doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these kids are no different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happens is not only are they sick,
but then you give them drugs that just
[SPEAKER_08]: destroy their body.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're being given the E back to the
EB kids now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, topical ketamine, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're two and a half years old or
younger and they're on Dilaudid,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And topical morphine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happens over time is not only are
you sick and struggle with these
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions, but your body becomes an
addict and it never functions well,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, in that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're seeing with them is the-
You're just treating the symptoms and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not treating the underlying cause
of the disease itself and you're deadening
[SPEAKER_01]: the body's own nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is there to sense discomfort,
to tell you that something is just not
[SPEAKER_01]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wonder again, so there's two things
that cannabis can potentially help with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is cannabis wonderful in its
wound healing properties, but also just
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory aspects alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are these treatments topical for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you create like a,
a sub dermal thing, but you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: treating this condition topically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I spent a couple of years now working
on a topical cream that with no bells and
[SPEAKER_08]: whistles.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just designed to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we worked with these EB families and
yeah, I don't have them prepared,
[SPEAKER_08]: but if we want, or we could do another
show on this, I could get pictures ready,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that it's just the anti-inflammatory
properties or, you know, from,
[SPEAKER_08]: with knees like the size of like
cantaloupes, just completely swollen to
[SPEAKER_08]: within three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a completely different leg,
just huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So significant anti-inflammatory
properties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And pain modulation and management.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when they, we see that we get
them off of some of these drugs that
[SPEAKER_08]: suppress the whole system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some families are doing large internal
dosing as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the kids have a G tube and they'll just
do upwards of 150 milligrams THC and 300
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when they do the internal dosing,
the kids show no sign of intoxication
[SPEAKER_08]: whatsoever, but that also will knock the
whole body inflammation down.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get benefit to the endocannabinoid
system so that it can be functioning in
[SPEAKER_08]: the most efficient manner that it can.
[SPEAKER_08]: And essentially you just see these kids
start to transform through a combination
[SPEAKER_08]: of a quicker time for the wounds to heal
and a healthier skin and healthier skin
[SPEAKER_08]: becomes a little bit more robust.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the key things that is,
is efficient or effective for
[SPEAKER_08]: epidermolysis belosa kids is the control
of itching and cannabis cream can do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still trying to make it better,
but when your skin, like when you get road
[SPEAKER_08]: rash, if anyone remembers, or a big kind
of skin wound, when it, or a tattoo,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: When it starts to heal, it itches,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the dangerous cycle because as the
wound's healing, then the kids are
[SPEAKER_08]: starting to itch, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what happens when you itch,
you break the skin in these kids and then
[SPEAKER_08]: you're just reopening this wound
constantly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times that's what gets them
is eventual either staph infection or skin
[SPEAKER_08]: cancer from the constant wounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these creams really help with that as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of that whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not able to cure the condition,
but if you are able to end pain and
[SPEAKER_08]: modulate the pain, decrease time for wound
healing and overall anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_08]: properties in the body, we see dramatic
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Changes in these kids and there's
significant progress going on with gene
[SPEAKER_08]: editing right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to get into CRISPR and those
things, but you know, these are probably
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be some of the frontline kids to
look at potential gene editing
[SPEAKER_08]: applications and some of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our goal is to, you know, really
improve their quality of life and just,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, make sure they're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when the cure comes, they can
experience it, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forrest, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to donate something a little bit
to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a vast supply of 88 to 1 CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the SC lab test on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody I've given it to has thought it
was absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to give you some.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can forward the SC lab, pick it along
with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second thing I want to say to you
is I forwarded all the information about
[SPEAKER_09]: the kids and your site and everything to
Jeff Sessions with a letter asking him to
[SPEAKER_09]: pull his head out of his ass and take a
good close look at the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to do a presentation to
Congress.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get those guys in front of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to tell them exactly what we
think with our kids there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I sent it to Jeff Sessions and I
also send it to a few other people up in
[SPEAKER_09]: government.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens, if anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys are too busy covering their own
asses right now for the money that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: spending doing other nonsense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to offer you this CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to make it available to
people for seven dollars a gram,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I want to give you guys all you need.
[SPEAKER_09]: No charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will put it to good use.
[SPEAKER_08]: And get it to those who need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Indra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Indra, by the way, and D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if there's anyone else I
missed, but I never want to interrupt good
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know you guys don't take it
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome to Hash Church episode 157.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about one hour in here to the to this
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got about five hundred and forty two
people watching in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And listening away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I love gathering every Sunday
with all of you and seeing where the
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always feels like I know you feel like
you don't want to be up on a soapbox for
[SPEAKER_03]: us, but it just seems like such a such an
important aspect of the like the tip of
[SPEAKER_03]: the spear, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a there's a whole handle
and there's all this other component.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the tip of the spear should get a lot
of attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't think that there is
anyone that could argue with you because
[SPEAKER_03]: of how you're coming at this and where
you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you said, you don't have a
product to sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's also how intelligent he comes
across.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the empathy and sympathy
comes through in your voice because you've
[SPEAKER_06]: experienced it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you hear that if you don't,
you're not human.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are pushing them and pushing them
into the uncomfortable region in ways that
[SPEAKER_06]: no other person can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thankful that we have
spokespersons like you that unfortunately
[SPEAKER_06]: are have come through the hard route and
had to educate yourself regarding the
[SPEAKER_06]: realities that you face.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you and Silas, the type of catalysts
that are going to affect real change for
[SPEAKER_06]: many.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we thank you for taking on your
difficulty with the dignity and a grace
[SPEAKER_06]: that benefits us all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm just honored to be here with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've paved the way here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I just saw was that there was
this disrespect that I thought was
[SPEAKER_08]: inappropriate to people like you,
the activists in the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was justified with this illusion
that it's all a game.
[SPEAKER_08]: And none of the things you're saying,
all the patients you've helped is real.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just had all these excuses to
justify not taking some really,
[SPEAKER_08]: really heartfelt activists seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just felt like I had another angle
to offer that to help to combat that exact
[SPEAKER_08]: dissidence in their thinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with us working together, we can make
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm just honored to be here with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a game to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a serious subject.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I say it on CNN too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of great, fun things that
come out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not all serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that I am not the most fun topic
when it comes to cannabis, and I enjoy all
[SPEAKER_08]: the other fun sides of cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the fact that it's only framed
that way that really bothered me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That every time there's a thing on the
news or CNN, I go, oh, it's 420 in
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado, and everybody's sparking up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the citizens are tired of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just always framed in this way
that it's just a big game.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just felt that I had something to add
to really show that there are parts of
[SPEAKER_08]: this conversation that are not funny,
and it's very serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: And should be taken very seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I felt like I had that to add to the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, as long as it's legal,
if they want to make fun of medical,
[SPEAKER_10]: make fun of industrial, but legally allow
it, I'm a happy guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm with you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but you know, the public making fun
of it, the way comedians have always chose
[SPEAKER_03]: to create the stereotypical jokes about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all that has a big negative sort
of impact on people that are trying to see
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant as for what it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sending mixed messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen this new show yet,
but I've heard disjointed is a lot of not
[SPEAKER_03]: the most popular cannabis humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is all the negative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stereotypes was one of the guest list is
that they had an opportunity to really do
[SPEAKER_06]: some intelligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, some of the lingo is current.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also saw one of the people who was
assisting or in the production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is persona non grata for what
she's done in our community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's only making us all look bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought we were past these
degenerate stoner stereotypes,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I come to hash church because I want
to have intelligent talk with intelligent
[SPEAKER_06]: people as opposed to these stereotypic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, dude, what's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even be straight, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we've all had to deal with
the unfortunate realities of life and many
[SPEAKER_06]: of these realities.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people, you know, had AIDS and stuff
like that, people didn't realize that they
[SPEAKER_06]: were ostracized completely from their
families.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were basically ostracized by
everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were literally sometimes their only
physical contact with somebody who would
[SPEAKER_06]: even speak to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was beyond disheartening to see
society so ignore the realities that we
[SPEAKER_06]: were forced to deal with those realities.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are humbling realities.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when you have to stare into open
cysts on people's arms, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: open source to the point where you're
uncomfortable just even looking at them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but you have to have the inner
strength to stand there and say this
[SPEAKER_06]: person is a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need help.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need help now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm here to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that to me is where I feel so insulted
by disjointed, even though it is humorous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It still is a poke at our reality that,
you know, a lot of our reality isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: funny, as you know, for us firsthand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there's ugly realities to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really hoped more for something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a fan of the show, but I encourage
each one of you to I encourage a woman to
[SPEAKER_06]: look at it to see it for yourself,
you know, to judge for yourself,
[SPEAKER_06]: because some of this stuff is giggly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of this stuff is very cringe
worthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The most cringe worthy for me is when they
went and did Jack Herrera's funeral and
[SPEAKER_06]: they mocked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was there and it was not handled in
any type of disrespectful way in any way,
[SPEAKER_06]: shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nor the portrayals.
[SPEAKER_06]: They changed his name to Heron as opposed
to Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that type of portrayal, it was
literally a slap in the face to me and my
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very difficult for me to then get
behind something like that that totally
[SPEAKER_06]: insults heroes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would not know you if it had not
been for Jack Herrera coming to my
[SPEAKER_06]: university in 1989 and me getting off my
ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to have him mocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a show like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they made it seem like he grew Herrera
the strain, which was not the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: The strain was bestowed upon him out of
utter fucking respect, out of all the hard
[SPEAKER_06]: work and dedication that he has done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to perpetuate that into the eyes of
the ether of the collective consciousness
[SPEAKER_06]: is disrespectful to Jack's name and the
hard work that he's done and all the hard
[SPEAKER_06]: work a lot of us have done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yes, it's made in jest,
but it is insulting the way that it was
[SPEAKER_06]: presented to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the sort of
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean you didn't think the show
was funny?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cringeworthy in areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did laugh at times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's called dabbing and the dabber
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're current with their lingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's nice to hear the current lingo
being used prior properly as opposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: the silliness or the puns we're always
left with.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was disingenuous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't get behind something like
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you find that the majority of
cannabis humor movies over the decades
[SPEAKER_10]: have been kind of like making us look a
bit like losers?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not just making us look a little
bit like losers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, it's a huge part of the of the of
the the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you look back like that,
first of all, the culture that's that's
[SPEAKER_03]: basically setting the tone for everything
is Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hollywood makes the movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hollywood makes the TV shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wants to export America's
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's importing it to their
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wants to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a major point of contention with
me, because people can blame William
[SPEAKER_03]: Randolph Hearst all they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may have started it, but it's these
these people that are continuing to
[SPEAKER_03]: propagate it by, you know, shitty jokes on
Jimmy Kimmel or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, anti and sort of prohibition
based stereotypical jokes that I just feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like, man, like when there's a side of
this that Forrest is coming in and sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: with us, how can you make jokes like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: That this is this is a disservice to the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's keeping people from seeing the actual
benefits of the plant by.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when people think they're going in to
fight activity in their community,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what they envision.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, well, we just don't want that in our
community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people, the non-cannabis related
community, that's their only experience is
[SPEAKER_08]: their television, for the most part,
or or story, horror stories they see in
[SPEAKER_08]: the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when they go in and say,
well, we don't want this in our community.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times that's what they're
envisioning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this dumb stoner culture that really
doesn't exist in very many places?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's harmful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Cheech and Chong, they were
snapshots in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually one time I did a panel with
Tommy Chong, and afterwards we were at the
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking circle getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked him that I was I could in
front of him as an activist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, hey, you know, I really felt
your humor set us back a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, I get that, kid,
respectfully, but you got to understand it
[SPEAKER_06]: was the darkest days of prohibition,
the only way we could get through with
[SPEAKER_06]: humor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, much respect coming from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get that because you have literally one
of the few people have carved a reality
[SPEAKER_06]: out of nothing in the Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the continued perpetuation of
those stereotypes and prolonging them into
[SPEAKER_06]: the 70s, past the 70s, into the 80s,
into the 90s and into the now and now with
[SPEAKER_06]: disjointed are the problems, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we didn't the understanding of
cannabis in the 70s was not what it is
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why, you know, in my first kind
of opening statement I made there was we
[SPEAKER_08]: can't even talk about cannabis like we're
talking about it in 2008 today,
[SPEAKER_08]: let alone, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I love Cheech and Chong.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had grown up on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That stuff was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But but the time is death.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: The the understanding has changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The evidence behind the understanding is
there and has changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the conversation hasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really where the problem is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I see a lot of people
doing in their local communities is
[SPEAKER_08]: they're allowing really outdated tactics
and arguments to be made about cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and how it's going to be integrated or not
in our communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a conversation in 2017 is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're open and understand,
you know, the the just wave of good data
[SPEAKER_08]: and science that is just being done every
day and coming at us like a tsunami.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if we can just keep up with just
a little bit of that, you can see that a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of the conversation is just old and
outdated.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even pertain anymore or
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, it's just prevalent in
communities and it's continuing to be
[SPEAKER_08]: successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we're seeing bands,
you know, all over California in every
[SPEAKER_08]: county.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll give this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give this up to Tommy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when if you go see him and you
go see him speak, his memory is
[SPEAKER_03]: impeccable.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell he's a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that sense, he's kind of showing
that the stereotype maybe isn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: stereotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's outliving all of his contemporaries
that were drinkers and smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He survived cancer and beat it using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's you know, I'm in that same
boat of not liking the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a huge fan of Cheech and Chong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought, man, these guys are and
it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we weren't I was a very,
very little kid at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really understand what the
mentality was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the panelists can, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably a pretty damn dark time
after Nancy Reagan came out and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: just say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that in the 80s and the 70s?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he did he did that in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it during.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a comedy routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was meant to be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was meant to be poking fun at
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the classic example is it is
art imitating life or is life imitating
[SPEAKER_01]: art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was already kind of like a
Hispanic community in East L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: that was just like Cheech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and yeah, they were all smoking weed
and it was just it was part of just the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture of who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just kind of like the deadheads
and the fish heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, in a sense, we were
Mark, you remember we were able to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: at fish shows or dead shows in arenas
where if during a Neil Young, you took out
[SPEAKER_01]: one lighter, you were immediately swarmed
by by security.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was it that Bill Graham was able
to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was why were the Bill Graham shows
when the Grateful Dead played?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why were they allowed to smoke weed at the
at the venues?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if weed was being smoked at the
venues, that means there was a traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: circus outside that was bringing all kinds
of different, you know, things and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just drugs, but wares and everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when the dead came to town,
it was a real, real traveling circus that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually brought all kinds of,
you know, not just creepy people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just weirdness into the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes like in Vegas, you would
never even know that the dead were in town
[SPEAKER_01]: because Vegas is already pretty weird to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll just go back to Cheech and Chong
just being more of a reflection on
[SPEAKER_01]: society.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I would compare them
honestly now in a way that I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: really seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would compare them to what Dave
Chappelle came and did years later with
[SPEAKER_03]: stereotypical race humor and pushing that
envelope, maybe in 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got like a lot of groups saying,
hey, man, you're not doing us any favors
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to have people take it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet at the time, Chappelle's comedy
was so disruptive and so hilarious and
[SPEAKER_03]: made us all think in a different way that
who's to say what's good and bad,
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say Tommy Chong, when I think it
was in 2016, so not too long, a year and a
[SPEAKER_08]: half ago or so, the Sacramento Bee,
the Capitol here in California did a three
[SPEAKER_08]: day story on my family in Silas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They called it the Silas project.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can look it up Sacramento Bee and
Silas project.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the sheriff had rated Silas's grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was fighting here and raising hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did a three day story on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tommy Chong picked it up and shared it
on his Twitter and all those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still to this day, you don't see
a lot of that sort of posting coming from
[SPEAKER_08]: him and some others.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I definitely appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it showed that he is keeping up on
some of the other contexts that cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: activism has taken shape in the last 10
years and got a lot of attention from that
[SPEAKER_08]: because of him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Tommy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that Cheech Marin is
heavily involved in is establishing a
[SPEAKER_01]: museum for Latino art in I think it's
Riverside, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a story a couple of weeks ago in
the news on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, he's assembled the largest
collection of Latino art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's now going to basically,
I think they're looking to raise a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars to turn this library site,
I believe it is, into basically a museum
[SPEAKER_01]: where this art can be shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, these people are doing
beneficial things in society.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the positions they played
back in that comedy routine, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actors, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're acting that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both really, really high intellect
people with a lot more to contribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: society than just up and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just portraying a couple of
stoners in that movie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what other contexts could you do it
in back then?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the understanding of cannabis was
pretty much pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been some other comedy
routine making fun of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just making fun of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back and listen to their
routines on their first couple albums are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you listen to it high, it's even
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was actually one of the guys who had
the big bamboo record album and inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: album, they had a big bamboo rolling
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the guys old enough to
actually roll a joint in that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about a quarter worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we rolled a joint, a big brown Mexican
weed that we would take the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we smoked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Cheech and Chong joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lasted a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those papers were made by Esmeralda.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the time that that big album came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I bought 10 of those albums and had
those Esmeralda papers around for quite a
[SPEAKER_09]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to clean the seeds out on the
record album, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a time-honored tradition of
having seeds just go down the side of your
[SPEAKER_01]: record album as you were cleaning out your
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people are afraid.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to paraphrase an idiot who is
arguing with Trump right now, the more
[SPEAKER_09]: afraid dogs are, the louder they bark.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got your people in the community that
are barking the loudest are the ones that
[SPEAKER_09]: are most fearful of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until you find a way to placate those
people or bring them into the fold of
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding, it's going to be a
difficult fight because fear of the
[SPEAKER_09]: unknown is the scariest thing that human
beings have.
[SPEAKER_09]: These people don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're afraid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is why I think they're fighting
a losing battle because you can only watch
[SPEAKER_08]: Fox News or only watch CNN or only be red
or blue or however people like to sanction
[SPEAKER_08]: off their information.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can only search for bad research
that's been done over the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to find harmful effects of cannabis
to reinforce your views.
[SPEAKER_08]: But illness is non-discriminatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cancer hits one in three.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, rare disease, albeit rare,
is rather common.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you have one in 50,000,
one in 300,000 of a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: different rare diseases, you know,
it hits people in all demographics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when that experience happens,
that change is a ripple through their
[SPEAKER_08]: community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so when I get people from church
groups who come with their kids seizing
[SPEAKER_08]: and they don't want their church to know,
but within six months, their kids have
[SPEAKER_08]: relative stability and everyone's asking
the family why, and they start to feel
[SPEAKER_08]: more and more confident to share them
because they see that everything that
[SPEAKER_08]: they've known has not been 100% accurate
or everything they've been told.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a seed in that community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we get families from the
military and from the sheriff's department
[SPEAKER_08]: who come in as really hardcore ideologues.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like we said, experience has a way of
kicking your ass and really changing the
[SPEAKER_08]: way you see the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why anyone who thinks they're
fighting cannabis from being around and
[SPEAKER_08]: being used as a medicine, it just has no
idea what they're talking about because
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just a different conversation when it
comes to the medical needs of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: how it's going to hit people, whether you
believe in it or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when your doctor tells you there's no
other option, the only thing that might
[SPEAKER_08]: help you is maybe some of these
cannabinoid based therapies.
[SPEAKER_08]: People's worlds are going to change and it
changes within those communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm seeing it happen now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing whole church groups that were
against us one year, one of the kids in
[SPEAKER_08]: the group gets ill and all of a sudden
everyone's experiences is different and
[SPEAKER_08]: their attitudes are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, have you ever linked with Subcool
for us?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Subcool show for the first time a
couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Subcool?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's muted right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've only done it once, but we had a
good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They let me go off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's always fun.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Sub's been doing some pretty
awesome community work in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community from toy drives to all sorts of
different like planting gardens to help
[SPEAKER_03]: different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's always sort of been really good
at that sort of quality of stuff while
[SPEAKER_03]: running his business and doing all that
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to give him props for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't sure if you guys had linked
up, but definitely I'm glad you have
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's just helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he makes me nervous driving and
doing that though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Careful, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, he's now he's smoking a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good that we got a nice big room
happening here right now for Wade made it
[SPEAKER_03]: back in seemed like he was having a little
bit of internet trouble there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like I was kind of picturing
this hilarious skit in my face because to
[SPEAKER_03]: me, Wade just seems like the most
chillest, most relaxed dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was picturing like him not getting
into church and like just like screaming
[SPEAKER_03]: and running around his house like,
damn it, I want to get into church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as a joke, because I know that's not
what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were probably like super calm going,
oh, geez, this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'll keep trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just keep trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas myself, I'm not going to lie,
I have gotten fairly upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: At my computer when I feel the
responsibility of getting church going
[SPEAKER_03]: even, you know, like having to be
somewhere on a Sunday where the internet
[SPEAKER_03]: works and I can it's a it's a
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And have you found it helped a lot when
you got angry at your computer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that when I get really angry with
my computer and like break it right over
[SPEAKER_03]: my my face, that's when I I just feel that
things work out the best for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things never work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually just in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so you know, I'm not actually driving
down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I had I had a comment I wanted to
make.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the duality of what you guys
are talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, California right now in northern
California, where I live, is set to bury
[SPEAKER_12]: the fucking country in cannabis and Keith.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to bury the country in wheat.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was at a restaurant on Tuesday
afternoon having dinner in a local place I
[SPEAKER_12]: like to eat at because there's lots of
tourists and I like people I like to talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the lady asked me what I did for a
living.
[SPEAKER_12]: I told her I grew cannabis and I told her
that I also sell my cannabis and raise
[SPEAKER_12]: money for sick children.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she said, well, what does cannabis
have to do with children?
[SPEAKER_12]: She was 55 years old, upperly mobile,
big old ass diamond on her hand,
[SPEAKER_12]: driving a BMW, family full of yuppie wine
drinkers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she looked at me and she said,
oh, well, does that work?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we're fighting in this
country.
[SPEAKER_12]: She is an intelligent, articulate woman.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was fucking clueless that cannabis can
help kids with autism and seizures and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is not this is not us.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is not what I call us,
the stoner community or the fam community.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what I consider to be America.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was clueless that cannabis could maybe
help kids with seizures and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, you can imagine the
mouthful of information she got from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was backing up a little bit,
you know, but I just had to.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really what I'm seeing this week.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are we are producing so much cannabis
and medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now that we can treat the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yet most Americans still think that a
value is the cure to our problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to point that out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It got under my skin this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's definitely a system that's
been put in place for that all to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems as though people will only
hear it when they're told it by
[SPEAKER_03]: particular, you know, the people they
trust, the anchor on the news or the
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper that they are one person at a
time, just like everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can see how fast that's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Sheldon, whereas when they want
everyone to know something, they put it
[SPEAKER_03]: into their little media system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, but wham, four billion
people in one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it great when you finally do like
talk to sort of random strangers on the
[SPEAKER_01]: way back from the airport in the shuttle
to people that, yeah, you meet wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: when they ask, what is it that you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start to tell them or to describe
that, no, this isn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching Chong and getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really about medicine and the
reunification of human beings with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, because until the last century,
which, as Todd used to say, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis deficient century, humans were,
you know, United with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just the reunification century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a mission of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is sometimes one person at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to people, again, who had no
clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got their email address and then I sent
them like the Meshul movie, sent them
[SPEAKER_01]: links to Ash Church, sent them links so
they could actually see for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there are clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is validity to taking this thing to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, so winning people over
one at a time, I think 10 years and from
[SPEAKER_01]: now, this will be a mute discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also say we should always
represent as someone's got a reverberation
[SPEAKER_03]: in the microphone there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure who's not muted, but I think
it just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always got to give props to the stoner
community, too, for being the stewards for
[SPEAKER_03]: so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, you know, who the heck do
you think came out with all this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who started digging and digging and
learning all this information?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was people who were using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get high, to feel euphoria,
to feel positive, to relieve stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as the stereotype is,
we should always also respect the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: experience of feeling elevated,
feeling the so-called high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be a bad word.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't be embarrassed by it because
it is how it's the thing that has kept it
[SPEAKER_03]: alive because, you know, for cannabis to
be a around in the way that it is for
[SPEAKER_03]: people like Wendy Turner to get cannabis
for her son, Colton, and for people like
[SPEAKER_03]: Forrest to meet people like Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like people who are getting high,
who were the stewards of that plant for
[SPEAKER_03]: all those decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can call it medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was it was that euphoria that that
got a lot of us involved passionately to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where you won receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one of the most prevalent
receptors in the human brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's not a happy accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking last week with Chris at
the Fountain of Youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did a little bit of research
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm absolutely convinced that when people
smoked cannabis before they really
[SPEAKER_01]: understood the biological impacts and then
the cannabinoid system, think about when
[SPEAKER_01]: Native people smoked it probably for the
first time and felt like no more pain or
[SPEAKER_01]: no more anxiety or they probably did say,
hey, this could make me live forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Fountain of Youth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of John's quote where he
said, it's hard to feel bad when you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indra said that like a year ago on
Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, it's hard to feel bad when you
feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, wow, that's just so
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The load is accurate and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's profound.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes drew us in and the
cannabinoids made us stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark, let me share something else with the
panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's some people here that don't
know.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have, and this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, I just find this cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have Alpha 1.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a respiratory disease.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a liver disease.
[SPEAKER_12]: My white blood cells attack my internal
organs and I don't have a protein that
[SPEAKER_12]: protects it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm dissolving from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I quit using cannabis when they told me
I had lung problems for a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people that know me closer know I had
about with alcoholism and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: drugs and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: 292 days clean of all drugs right now,
except for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is my point.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I, when I, when I started using
cannabis again, I really obviously like,
[SPEAKER_12]: wow, why the fuck did I quit using this?
[SPEAKER_12]: But recently my diseases was really
kicking my ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: The pain I experienced.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just brutal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we talk about the benefits
of cannabis and I'm so cool and I smoke
[SPEAKER_12]: weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the last couple of days I've actually
noticed like just brutal pain from this
[SPEAKER_12]: disease.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'll smoke a couple of bowls,
which for me it's really weird because
[SPEAKER_12]: when I smoke it hurts like shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: It hurts my lungs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes me panic a little bit because my
lungs are not in great condition,
[SPEAKER_12]: but follow me here.
[SPEAKER_12]: About five minutes afterwards when my
lungs recover from, from the carcinogen of
[SPEAKER_12]: actual smoke going in them, my life all of
a sudden doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_12]: My panic goes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in all these feelings that I have from
this illness, this horrible pain and it
[SPEAKER_12]: causes all throughout the whole body,
it just goes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, it's funny that I've been an
advocate for this plant for so long,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I'm telling you again today that even
though it's tough for me to consume the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant, but the smoke and I consume at
night, the benefit that I get from this
[SPEAKER_12]: plant mentally, emotionally, spiritually
overcomes anything that it could do to me
[SPEAKER_12]: because I have to consume smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the last week or two, it is like,
I'm just like, Oh God, I'm in such pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me take a couple of hits of this wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of a sudden I'm like, Hey man,
I want to put on some fucking Steven
[SPEAKER_12]: stills and enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just had to say that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, after 45 years of smoking,
it still does what I needed to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I'm a proponent of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the vaporizing is just not
happening for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not strong enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not giving you that relief that a
good blast gives you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the problem, Mark, is my lungs only
will move like a quarter of an inch.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can't empty the damn bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing with an E-nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't inhale long enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I use a teeny bong and a teeny,
teeny, teeny pipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I just smoke like the tiniest
piece of wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: I drop a teeny piece of wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even use a dab brick.
[SPEAKER_12]: It melts and flows down.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the amount of smoke I get,
that teeny amount of smoke I get from
[SPEAKER_12]: these great concentrates, we make after I
say, after my lungs go, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: The smoke's gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like right now I got high about 15 minutes
ago and life changed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when I left the house,
I was like, Oh shit, man, I got to harvest
[SPEAKER_12]: 120 pounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I'm going through a divorce.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, life just is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I smoked a couple of balls and
I'm like, Hey, let's fucking get our hash
[SPEAKER_12]: church and hang out with my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just can't say enough for what we
should, um, we should get together and
[SPEAKER_08]: talk and see if we can get you set up with
a good supplement regimen because I've
[SPEAKER_08]: talked to more than a few people who've
only experienced cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine through smoking, have their life
completely changed with a good supplement
[SPEAKER_08]: regimen and supplement, consistent
supplement dosing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd be happy to put some things
together and, and talk to you about some
[SPEAKER_08]: new ways you could approach that that
could introduce new types of relationship
[SPEAKER_08]: that might really help some of the things
you're going through as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, this is Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, yeah, I use finctures quite
a bit sub cool because uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked most of my life and I can't
smoke enough cannabis to get the thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long ago I started adding hash to what
I was smoking and still it abuses my lungs
[SPEAKER_02]: to get as much as I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I supplement with tinctures,
uh, and you can find tinctures that are
[SPEAKER_02]: made that taste good for you and meantime
have significant enough dose that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I find it's as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I smoke because I enjoy smoking at
this point, not because it's adding to my
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid, uh, levels in my blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, forest tells me sometimes that I maybe
have too high a cannabinoid, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: thing going in my blood, but, uh,
I enjoy the state of being that I,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, work for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get a lot of it from tinctures and
occasionally I have a chocolate or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, but, uh, yeah, I can't get
there with just smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss the buzzkill, you know,
some, I miss the buzzkill sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_12]: No far.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to explore this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so, and I'm going to, every time I
talk, I mean, I sound like I'm like so
[SPEAKER_12]: cool, feel special, but it's not like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are just the facts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm super fucking high strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: This illness has really got me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to take 20 volumes a day and now I
don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's smoke a high quality bubble hash
all day long.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jill said yesterday, you realize you've
got a lung disease and you smoke more
[SPEAKER_12]: meat.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I take a thousand milligrams of
cannabis every night, um, in a form of a
[SPEAKER_12]: peppermint patty, or I would not smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sleep at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, and you said something
earlier, I think I have too much damn
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis in my body.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, like for real, like I smoke
constantly and I eat constantly and I
[SPEAKER_12]: drink constantly.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's two points to this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never tried concentrated Rick
Simpson, like made from something that'll
[SPEAKER_12]: really put me down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but I want to talk about tolerance.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you, you said you've eaten
glycerin all your life and tinctures and
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how many proud people are,
you know, like me, they're in their
[SPEAKER_12]: forties or fifties.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they use canvas all their life for
medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you said, you just can't smoke
enough anymore or, or a tincture.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what is, what is, what is the
solution to that back the hell off?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, yeah, understanding what
tolerance is, I think is really important
[SPEAKER_08]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure Mark could, um, add a lot to
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I miss something, let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But tolerance is essentially, it's good to
understand the physiology of phyto
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids and essentially to boil it
down simply is, is they mimic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the body has a hard time telling the
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_08]: So THC's chemical structure so closely
resembles an andamide that when it bonds
[SPEAKER_08]: to the CB one receptor, the body thinks
it's the signal from an andamide.
[SPEAKER_08]: It acts accordingly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get miracle responses in the body,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't get the consequences of
neurotransmitter rate regulation gone
[SPEAKER_08]: wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're flooding your body with
high doses of THC, your body has more than
[SPEAKER_08]: one significant safety mechanism in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your endocannabinoid system is a safety
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really its job is to trigger and respond
to things that are going wrong in the body
[SPEAKER_08]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're flooding your body with THC,
other safety mechanisms start to trigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of those is the body's,
uh, observance of over and under
[SPEAKER_08]: production of an andamide.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it starts to think, wow, I must be
really overproducing endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_08]: because I look at all this an andamide in
my stream, even though it's THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what it starts to do is it starts to
down-regulate CB one receptors,
[SPEAKER_08]: which means it starts to shut them off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And essentially what happens is it's not
that people with high tolerance are able
[SPEAKER_08]: to just handle a bunch of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just can't absorb the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're urinating it out and it's
flushing out the body in other ways
[SPEAKER_08]: because your body is a safety mechanism
has turned off a large majority of the CB
[SPEAKER_08]: one receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is where the concept of a reset
comes in with some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when, when you pull them, when you
withhold the phyto cannabinoids from the
[SPEAKER_08]: body, all of a sudden the body says,
Oh my God, I've quit producing all this
[SPEAKER_08]: anandamide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something must be wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it starts to up-regulate and turn in,
turn on all the CB one receptors
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can, if you find that you're in a
place where you built up a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: tolerance, what you've done is you've shut
down a lot of CB one receptors and you can
[SPEAKER_08]: find that if you can get those to
up-regulate and turn back on, you can get
[SPEAKER_08]: just as much of a feeling with less
cannabis because you're able to absorb
[SPEAKER_08]: more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so you can lower the dose without
losing some of the effect that you like,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it takes time to allow the body to
up-regulate those receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I say time, you know,
we're talking, there's some studies that
[SPEAKER_08]: have shown 72 hours, you know,
uh, but you know, a week is more than
[SPEAKER_08]: enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times to have that sort of
effect.
[SPEAKER_12]: First, can I tell one of my stories?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm famous for stories.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I tell one of my story?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Marcus's show.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta ask him.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's short.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's short.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I, um, when I got popped the
second time and did my little John up in
[SPEAKER_12]: the cannon and everything, I was under
lock and key for around 19 months.
[SPEAKER_12]: And before, uh, before I left,
I had sent Julie, um, about an eighth of
[SPEAKER_12]: Jack's cleaner and about an eighth of
Danny boy to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause we were supposed to meet the day
before that grabbed me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So she put some of it away and bless her
heart forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I got out, um, there was more
time I had to pee for, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: all that, you know, the game, but then
there became a day when I was allowed to
[SPEAKER_12]: get high again for the first time in
almost two years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a guy who smokes, you know,
full time all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm in my head, I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Jill's making dinner and we get the
weed out.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's only a couple of grams left.
[SPEAKER_12]: She saved it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I take one hit of the Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm telling you right now,
before I finished the story, I should have
[SPEAKER_12]: fucking stopped there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, but then I took another hit of that
Jack's cleaner, that lemony freshness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she went into the kitchen and I got so
hot, like uncomfortably, like every person
[SPEAKER_12]: that ever came to my house in Florida,
I got up so stoned.
[SPEAKER_12]: They got lost when they left.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like instant karma payback that
Jill was talking like Charlie Brown's
[SPEAKER_12]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't communicate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my favorite part of the story,
it wasn't until the next day that I could
[SPEAKER_12]: actually communicate how fucking stoned I
actually got.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I kept going, I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she kept going, oh good, good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next morning I was like, look,
the house was flying through space.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that, that, I mean, I guess all my
receptors reset.
[SPEAKER_12]: My body went back to a virgin state.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and the other funny part about this
story is for about six months,
[SPEAKER_12]: every time I got high pass out and Jill
would go, I thought this guy was some
[SPEAKER_12]: hardcore stoner or some shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it took four or five months before I
could function again as a normal person
[SPEAKER_12]: smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I like that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a substantial break for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing I would just add some cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, let's, let's get in touch after
the show and I'm want to help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can even send you some things is
that there is a completely new experience
[SPEAKER_08]: people have when you keep sustained levels
of healing cannabinoids in the body for a
[SPEAKER_08]: two to three week period of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when, as opposed to what we're used
to, which are these blasts, which are
[SPEAKER_08]: spike and waves, you get these big
increases, these decreases, and you can
[SPEAKER_08]: continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you keep a supplement level,
sustained level in the body, different
[SPEAKER_08]: types of reactions start to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, at this point, I've seen so many
amazing results in different conditions
[SPEAKER_08]: that, you know, you get more and more
confident saying just, I would highly
[SPEAKER_08]: doubt that it would not have some sort of
improvement in your, in your condition.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times it's just, it's a
different type of relationship,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and, but when, when you
experience it, it's just shows how much we
[SPEAKER_08]: still have to learn about this amazing
plant and different ways we can integrate
[SPEAKER_08]: it into our lives.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will definitely take you up on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the anxiety level and go and go off
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem with alpha and, and,
and cannabis is so Friday, I felt great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I started harvesting my crop.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's key falling all over the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: My, my condition feels pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel normal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is, I'm digressing into personal
shipping, but then when it hits,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's just a whammy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, like last night, I couldn't take
three steps without gasping and panning.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't move very fast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I honestly believe that it's not just
alpha.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that as a panic condition,
I believe my lungs are vibrating or
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever the hell's going on and I can't
breathe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it exasperates itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've always believed if I could get an
infusion of cannabis at that time,
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever cannabinoid works for me,
whether it be CBN or whatever the hell it
[SPEAKER_12]: is, if I could get an infusion of cannabis
at that time without taking a giant hit of
[SPEAKER_12]: hash and the lungs that are already
trashed, I think I could get much better
[SPEAKER_12]: results than sitting there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I told you, I gave up drugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I have a full blown panic attack,
a seizure attack, the only tool I have
[SPEAKER_12]: right now is I went to a class that taught
me how to not shit myself to be present,
[SPEAKER_12]: not a big past or future trip.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can actually take a panic attack and
not lose my mind, but God would it be cool
[SPEAKER_12]: if I had a liquid or something that I
could consume that would act fast to bring
[SPEAKER_12]: that down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're telling me there's something
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Cava Cava Extract Sub.
[SPEAKER_09]: I extracted somebody for a friend who was
having serious anxiety and it's not a very
[SPEAKER_09]: big yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a beautiful golden oil and just a
tiny dot of it on the end of a flat
[SPEAKER_09]: Chinese chopstick will bring a speed freak
down to ground in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the hottest thing since sunburn when
it comes to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cava extract is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that in, but we've also
seen with PTSD and other issues,
[SPEAKER_08]: the, the, the problem is, is it's learning
how to look at it in a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_08]: different way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're, we're reactive with cannabis right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have an experience and we go to
cannabis for that reactive response.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and with a lot of, a lot of these
supplement health approaches that can be
[SPEAKER_08]: used with cannabis, it's a proactive
response, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of we using cannabis and
looking forward in time to how you're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to feel in a few minutes or an hour,
we want to look at supplementing these
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids in the body in a way where we
look backwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, we look back and say,
okay, how many anxiety attacks did I have
[SPEAKER_08]: in the last 30 days?
[SPEAKER_08]: We get a good journal of that and see what
we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we start to work with these
supplements for two, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we look back over that period of
time and we measure how many did we have?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, gosh, I only had three as opposed to
17.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just a, it's a different type of
process and it's a different type of,
[SPEAKER_08]: of it takes a little more time,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not something that it's, it's
immediate, but I've seen it time and time
[SPEAKER_08]: again, especially with PTSD sort of
anxiety, serious anxiety attacks and those
[SPEAKER_08]: sorts of things that it absolutely can
benefit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're in a state of panic and
you're concerned about your health,
[SPEAKER_08]: all those things, modulate your
endocannabinoid system and your
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid system's job is to
regulate the things in the body that
[SPEAKER_08]: prevent panic attacks and prevent these
other things from happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're all tied in together,
which is, you know, why I advocate
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody being on a supplement of CBD and
certain other cannabinoids, THC being one
[SPEAKER_08]: of them, CBC, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like an Omega three, you know,
because it does have this proactive
[SPEAKER_08]: preventative ability to help the body ride
through heavy times of stress that we
[SPEAKER_08]: might not see coming all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, we don't have to keep going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes I hate, sometimes I hate
speaking in front of really smart people,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I'm going to head and do it now.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that, I mean,
you would think I would know this stuff,
[SPEAKER_12]: but this show is definitely about
education.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's learn together.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had the recently, I had the
opportunity to be a judge for the Hot
[SPEAKER_12]: Times Cannabis Cup and they gave me the
hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could talk a whole show about that,
but that's not what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: They gave me CBD medibles, like 35 kinds
of CBD medibles.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the most CBD I've ever
consumed in my life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the two things that I noticed that
surprised me was it did not sedate me at
[SPEAKER_12]: all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I thought if I took four or 500
milligrams of CBD at nighttime,
[SPEAKER_12]: I would go to bed, but absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing, and you've talked about
looking backwards, and I want to tell you
[SPEAKER_12]: that during that time, I think my head was
clearer and I think I felt smarter.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think of those observations
about high quantities of CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you grew brain cells.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we see across the board,
and this is one of the myths I like to
[SPEAKER_08]: dispel a lot of the concern with cannabis
is right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The effects on children and learning and
does it decrease IQ points or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you without a shadow of a
doubt, but again, we're working with
[SPEAKER_08]: developmentally delayed and severe
conditions, but we see across the board
[SPEAKER_08]: cognitive improvement in kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have kids who, I mean, sometimes
dramatic from not speaking to starting to
[SPEAKER_08]: form words and starting to use one word
sounds, you know, so severe conditions,
[SPEAKER_08]: but from kids take Silas, for example,
from kids at times he's a one word,
[SPEAKER_08]: kid, you know, he can't really structure
sentences together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as his brain gets healthier,
and when we introduce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_08]: all of a sudden we were getting full
sentences out of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he would say things, we'd both turn
and look like it had to be another kid,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a hundred percent on the train of
when you improve neurocognition function,
[SPEAKER_08]: neurotransmitter regulation in the brain,
when the body's able to work, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: homeostasis isn't just a buzzword when
it's able to be in the proper balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to think that the
functioning of your physiological system
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that also includes the function of the
brain and cognition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not one that has to be convinced.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see it every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: All that turns around the ability to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: If kids can't pay attention because
they're so involved with what else is
[SPEAKER_09]: going on in their body and the irritation
is so great, they can't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might miss taking that for not
developing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the minute they can pay attention,
the minute they can actually get some
[SPEAKER_09]: relief and start paying attention,
they advance rapidly, just like any other
[SPEAKER_09]: being.
[SPEAKER_09]: This business of being able to pay
attention is something that we don't pay
[SPEAKER_09]: enough attention to in our society.
[SPEAKER_11]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to talk to you about what you
were just saying about the high amounts of
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, morning guys, morning son.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just went through this, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was having a lot of problems with
my knees and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not really, I take CBD,
but I don't take high amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had these CBD bites and it was at
the high times cannabis cup here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they gave me a bag full of CBD edibles
and stuff like that, just like you said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can see, and I was able to run up
the stairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was just kind of relating when you
said that to me, I was like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, that's why I'm digging through
these bags beside me, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I ate all these CBD bites and
they were so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were 250 rounds of bite.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll eat two of them at a time,
but I can totally relate to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I started eating more and higher
amounts of CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm, I'm currying.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's not sedating me at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting more and done.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm more active.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting into doing more things.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going back to rehab, like I said,
for the gym, for my injuries and to tie a
[SPEAKER_11]: chain and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've been eating a lot of amount of
high CBD now for the last month,
[SPEAKER_11]: just like over the thousand milligrams a
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's actually making me feel pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's part of the cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we, the collateral center we're
trying to provide is that being present
[SPEAKER_08]: and aware of your own body, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to hit you like a
steamroller in certain applications of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually have to observe and pay
attention, but sometimes when you're
[SPEAKER_08]: observing and present in your body and
looking, you notice miraculous effects
[SPEAKER_08]: that can kind of, you just miss because
you feel good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're doing something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't notice that you didn't have
that same pain that would have been there
[SPEAKER_08]: because it didn't occur.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why a lot of people were really
trying to deal with chronic issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: The number one thing I recommend is that
they're journaling their incidents,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many incidents are you having?
[SPEAKER_08]: How intense are they so that you can look
back and look at it, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, with an impartial view of seeing
exactly what was occurring because we
[SPEAKER_08]: distort things in our mind, we get busy,
we're going off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we feel good, sometimes we just
don't notice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we quit on the treatments or we
don't continue as maybe a supplement that
[SPEAKER_08]: really benefited our lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden the pain's back,
you know, because we're not just being
[SPEAKER_08]: present and observing and treating it,
um, like the medicine it is that,
[SPEAKER_08]: that it needs to be maintained.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some work in there,
but when you can really approach it that
[SPEAKER_08]: way, observe your body, be present journal
and log the incidents so you can see what
[SPEAKER_08]: is and isn't working.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can really dial in a system that can
have huge benefits on quality of life,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it is a proactive approach as opposed
to a lot of our experience with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is more reactive and immediate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I noticed from taking a half a
teaspoon of CBD a day that I have,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing that for the past four or
five months now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things I've noticed over a
period of time with doing it is a
[SPEAKER_09]: tremendous feeling of wellbeing that I
find in my body that I didn't have before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel, I wake up, I wake up in
the morning and I feel wellbeing and I get
[SPEAKER_09]: up and I've got energy and my three
titanium pages in my back aren't hurting
[SPEAKER_09]: me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my frozen sciatic nerve from the
titanium cages isn't bothering me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have this feeling of wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I gravitate, I eat a half a spoon
of it every single day because it leaves
[SPEAKER_09]: me with that feeling of wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you could call that a high.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to look at it a certain way,
I know that Sam doesn't feel like you get
[SPEAKER_09]: high off CBD, but the feeling of wellbeing
is, it goes back to my original statement.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to feel bad when you're feeling
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so- I would love to share a funny
story on myself about how I learned this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing we're talking about, the effect of
high CBD dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do with tincture,
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were making, from ACDC, a tincture that
was really high in CBD, not much THC at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd gotten it to where we had 350
milligrams of CBD and had a little half
[SPEAKER_02]: fluid ounce bottle like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can make it out,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, early version of it, the top
wasn't very good and I had one in my
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket and I was sitting on a bench
outside and long story short, the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottle came off and it poured out on
the bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd put a lot of effort into making
that tincture and having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really wanting to, it was a
tragedy to me that it had fallen on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got down on my hands and knees and
licked it all up off the bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, I couldn't go to
sleep that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within about an hour, I have used my body
pretty hard in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any serious conditions really
other than glaucoma, which is what brought
[SPEAKER_02]: me to cannabis in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I felt better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not sleep that night, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said something like that earlier and
that's what made me think of this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't sleep, but I had a great night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught up on some reading I had been
wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day I got up, I was ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: By that afternoon, I took a nap,
woke up that afternoon, took dinner and
[SPEAKER_02]: went back to sleep, slept all night,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ever since then, yeah, I've tried to
keep some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found actually that small doses of CBD
still in the acid form, which is a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit hard to do, but in a tincture,
you can preserve them still in the acid
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And small dosing actually works pretty
well for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking probably 20, 25 milligrams a
day over the course of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: few drops at a time of a tincture like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really helps a lot with my general
sense of wellbeing is how I think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a physical experience than a
psychoactive one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's really no
psychoactive aspect to it other than how
[SPEAKER_02]: good it can feel to feel good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Feeling of wellbeing has to bleed back
through your entire sensory network in
[SPEAKER_09]: your body in order for you to have it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So literally that means your whole body is
saying kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how the sensation of feeling
good comes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the same when you feel bad,
when you feel bad, your entire body is
[SPEAKER_09]: telling you, you're feeling bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hey, Sub, make yourself available,
damn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll come and get you some breath.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, when I have my own home again,
and people don't get yelled at for coming
[SPEAKER_12]: to my house, you can come stay with me if
you would like to, okay?
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get that shit fixed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was gonna show, Mark, did you see this
on my feed?
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought this was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm a wound up guy and I'm also the
weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought maybe, and I love ink.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought I would put my money where my
mouth is this week.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of my favorite terpenes is Mercium.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had it tattooed on my hand,
right on the hand that I trim weed with.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then when I was doing some research,
the thing we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_12]: man, cannabis terpenes are fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm gonna say it wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of you smart guys can help me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's carposaline, but it's the oil of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have it on my left hand.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, cariophiline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, man.
Cariophiline.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cariophiline.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go, you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now try beta cariophiline.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got, just so you know, I got a cat,
it's called California piney.
[SPEAKER_12]: I found it online.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming it's orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Terpene boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great to bring up conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when I reach for somebody now,
immediately they say, why does that
[SPEAKER_12]: tattooed on your hand?
[SPEAKER_12]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I love terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need my shit to be loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep doing your thing, sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark, can I ask you a couple of questions
about, cause you're the man.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been pressing flowers,
having a blast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just learned to change temperatures
often, different strains, but I have,
[SPEAKER_12]: as I mentioned, I'm making a mountain of
Keith and early Keith so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be late Keith.
[SPEAKER_12]: So last night I did a pressing about 150
degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a blowout.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I didn't position the bag right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I actually ended up putting the whole
blowout back in a bag and making something
[SPEAKER_12]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, but what I wanted from you,
when we're pressing super high quality,
[SPEAKER_12]: Keith, and I'm talking about Keith that
keep, when you put in a jar after a few
[SPEAKER_12]: minutes, it becomes a hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell me, I see what you're
holding.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell me like what your
temperatures and times?
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you mind sharing that with me?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not bubble, but sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this was actually some sift that we,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was bubble actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sift, it depends on the, on how,
how, how much moisture is present in it
[SPEAKER_03]: and how, how clean that you've gotten it,
because that'll also affect the moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, I get asked constantly what
my numbers are, but they change depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on what I'm running.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for sift, you know, if it was,
if it was really sticky and kind of had a
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture content, then I might hit it as
high as 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if less moisture,
I'll go for a longer time at a lower
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, like 180 or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And pressure on hash, like, like with
flowers, I go half a ton and then a ton
[SPEAKER_12]: and I pump it on my, but when you're
pressing a little teeny packet of white
[SPEAKER_12]: sift that was just harvested a couple of
days ago, this is a delicate thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So can you go over pressures?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not smashing the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what, that, that's why
there's different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, there's the electric generator.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an, an air compressor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like two grand U S that's the
butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's the air compressor with the
foot pedal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there is the hand pump, which is
very, I like the hand pump in the M one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been using that a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, my unfortunate thing is that I
don't have a pressure gauge between my
[SPEAKER_03]: pump and my M one right now, but I can
tell you from past, I've always hit around
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 PSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is what I have my, my compressor set out
when I'm using a compressor and I hit it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I hit it pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer getting the majority of my,
of my squish in one shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did this one the other day and it
was over 90% of what there was to squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did this at 200 degrees and you can
see it didn't affect the color by any
[SPEAKER_03]: means.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very terpy, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Seedman Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just reeks like terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey family.
[SPEAKER_05]: All good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see everyone today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you, sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting on the porch, sitting on the
porch and enjoying some daylight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to get some sunshine on our
face here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's going to be a sunny day
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to get out, obviously maybe in
the next couple of hours, I'll make my way
[SPEAKER_03]: out onto the house sound for some of the
last boating of the season as we fall into
[SPEAKER_03]: fall, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love fall in British Columbia,
but I love winter a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fall is kind of just like it's shoulder
season for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's waiting through the mud until the
snow falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoulder season.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are things going in the Kootenays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a really tremendous year despite
all of the smoke that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a really nice, dry, hot summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really helpful for all of our
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have not done with the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty awful, but we were
thankful that we didn't have rain all
[SPEAKER_00]: summer like the past three summers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't have ash falling off on all
over all of our herb or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of it in greenhouses and
we've gotten a few rain storms,
[SPEAKER_05]: but pretty dry and sweet out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, a lot of flowers, amazing food,
all of the food gardens have impressed
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves in ways that, you know,
we haven't seen in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fruit trees, apple trees are
overabundant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we're making lots of food,
saving it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to build another root cellar,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collecting all the, the food,
but we don't have anywhere to put it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could definitely, I was hoping Tony
would be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to find out something about
Puerto Rico, but yeah, I'm wondering how
[SPEAKER_03]: they are actually, because they just got
smashed so hard and haven't heard anything
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with Dr. William Courtney and his
wife are in Dominica.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also got hit pretty hard and they
haven't been in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone's sort of, hoping that all of,
well, everyone on those Caribbean islands
[SPEAKER_03]: is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a scary thing having that rip
through Irma and Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're thinking about heading there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually do disaster relief and a lot
of the organizations that we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: might be heading down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of yesterday, there's big
conversations that we might be headed down
[SPEAKER_00]: with a group to go help women and children
in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out in the next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Righteous work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We figured we'd just be sandals on the
ground helping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sandals on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like your people there,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's that guy wearing Birkenstocks?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's winter.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's a, it's a, you guys
mentioned something earlier though,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you don't mind me asking kind of a gist
of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's going to be about, I don't
know, a couple of hundred tons of,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're calling it Campfire OG is
the joke.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is, this is cannabis that is smoke
flavored, bacon flavored.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, you know, people are not
going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_12]: You, you know, this is going to be part of
the 2017 season is ash and, and smoke
[SPEAKER_12]: flavored cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So is, is anybody seeing any of this
coming out?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the patient sub.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be the year in the
distillate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you work it, it won't have any
flavor.
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just turn it into, if it's
distilled and the distillation was done
[SPEAKER_01]: properly and it's clean, it shouldn't have
any flavor whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't think of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if you guys know,
if you've been watching us here,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're not a typical harvest here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark, I think he would be really
impressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are harvesting some giant colas for
the market.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our, our garden is a charity garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have four families that we're going to
get $2,500 to if we can get it to market.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have a six by six gorilla tent with
an air conditioner in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have Mr. Bond flying out on the
third.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three giant freezers and we also
have Frenchy cannoli coming out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're hashing the garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we chop it, we put it in freezers
or we chop it and we put it in Frenchy's
[SPEAKER_12]: little spinny machini thingy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I want to see some temple balls out
of my own garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, you know, I don't know if I'm sure
people are doing it, but we're actively
[SPEAKER_12]: hashing like a 70 or 80 pound garden
because I don't have anywhere to hang that
[SPEAKER_12]: much weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought you'd like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am absolutely in 100% full support of
you hashing your garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in support of everyone hashing their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always grew my garden to hash it just
because, uh, well, like it's the hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seemed to be, uh, make the most
sense to go right, right for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey sub.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: After, after Frenchy comes there and makes
a big mess at your place, I'll come and
[SPEAKER_09]: show you how to make cold sift without
water and make temple balls without water.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are about 10 times as nice and soft
and good as anything Frenchy does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Inj is throwing the glove down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just, boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just threw the glove down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchy's not even here to defend himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll invite him in real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Frenchy, uh, Indra's talking shit
about you on, uh, but wait, but wait,
[SPEAKER_12]: but wait, no, wait now, wait, but I will
kiss Frenchy on the lips and I'm not
[SPEAKER_12]: kissing John on the lips.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Frenchy, he will have tradition.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, just to have the fucker walking
around my garden and, and
[SPEAKER_12]: he is like the coolest guy I know when it
comes to talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call it Indra's balls versus
Frenchy's balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the morbid florist just put in
the chat room there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, we'll see who's got the nicest
balls because sub's going to hit both of
[SPEAKER_03]: those balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he'll let us know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody renamed them already Indra's cold
balls, by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I'm going to cut out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys for letting me take over a
minute and learn lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll laugh since you guys are talking
about CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't happen to have any CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I drove my ass to Sonoma patient group
and I'm going to go in here and get me
[SPEAKER_12]: some CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to hash your whole garden
like that with Frenchy, you might,
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you have a good worm farm start
because all that, uh, all that leaf matter
[SPEAKER_05]: is just the best worm food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was talking to bond last night about,
or I was talking to bond last night about,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, uh, how to properly lasagna.
[SPEAKER_12]: The, uh, my, well, I'm going to use this
stuff called earth shine on my 400 gallon
[SPEAKER_12]: pots was dissolved the roots.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to pile most of our bulk
leaf cannabis, the stuff we can't sell to
[SPEAKER_12]: the cookie makers on top of the pots and
then cover it with straw.
[SPEAKER_12]: And let that act as like a kind of a
compost thing that it's all of everything
[SPEAKER_12]: in those 400s over the season.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're absolutely going to put as much
carbon from the plant back into our
[SPEAKER_12]: garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably throw some worms in
there too, over the winter and they would
[SPEAKER_05]: come alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they would stay alive and
propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just break it down faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Add to it all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't, you had guys that have been
following me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I became a worm farmer this year and I
learned that worm farming is as much work
[SPEAKER_12]: as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have these giant bins.
[SPEAKER_12]: Out back of my house that, um,
we worked every day for a long time,
[SPEAKER_12]: but then we got busy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I went down there the other day
thinking that my worms were probably dead
[SPEAKER_12]: and Whoa, they're not.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I have is three boxes of slime,
which used to be eggs and garbage and
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have a million worms.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I figured I would put like a double
handful in each pot before I put the hay
[SPEAKER_12]: down and I, they'll be good to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, sub cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you reach out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be happy to get you some things and
help you set up a good supplement regimen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Foster.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll have may like reach out right
away.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know he's got your contact information.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're running, but I wanted to let
you know that over the last few years,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the genetics that you've put out
there have been good mother plants for
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses that we've been doing here in
Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're getting really lovely things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for putting that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes my day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love, I love the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not know what I would do without you
people right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you and much love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he say you people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean us people's us, us people's.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are my people's the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst comes to worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: My people's comes first little dilated
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: For you right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming in, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much love from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's nice to have sub stop in and
share a little bit of his time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the guy is definitely busy when
you know, every time he comes in Sunday
[SPEAKER_03]: morning, he's in his car driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got to go to the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to harvest 120 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like making his own worms and,
and worm castings can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because commercial worm farms often feed
their worms with grains and they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have a proper way of vetting the grains to
know that there's no glyphosate in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's easily, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet if you test a lot of the worm
castings commercial that are on the,
[SPEAKER_05]: on the market, you'll find glyphosate and
other residues in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you feed the worms is absolutely
crucial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just getting worm castings as
being a really magic thing for your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once again, knowing your inputs is
huge, especially when you're making hash
[SPEAKER_05]: or doing any kind of concentrate,
you really got to know what you put into
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant when you grew it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why when I feed, when I use my
rabbit poo, I mix in 15% Oakleaf mulch
[SPEAKER_09]: because the worms love Oakleaf mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so, that's the beauty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Llamas, alpacas, rabbits.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the best poop on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And utilizing leaf material now that we're
coming into fall is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about a tree and what it
uptakes from those deep roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like amazing mineral miners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you utilize those leaves as your
carbon source and your lasagna layering or
[SPEAKER_00]: in your worm farms, you're just going to
have a lot of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our big focus right now is raising our
bricks readings and raising our
[SPEAKER_00]: refactometer so that we have higher
mineral content in all of our foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as more nutrient dense ganja.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Rabbit poo is the best poo there is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than the other ones that you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can plant a seed in a turd right out
of a rabbit's butt and it won't burn and
[SPEAKER_09]: it'll grow well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I use rabbit poo and rabbit poo tea
extensively throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look on my Instagram at my
buds, they're thoroughly populated with
[SPEAKER_09]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: The buds are huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some 14 inch long tops that are
eight inches at the bottom where they
[SPEAKER_09]: start.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had to prop the plant up numerous
different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they look like someone sprinkled sugar
all over them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't use any other chemicals or
any other nonsense.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used rabbit poo, worms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get the worms in the rabbit poo from the
rabbit meat farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got rabbit urine in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I use that and I don't use any other
stuff on it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't spray it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't put any bug stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't put any preventative mold or
moisture things in place because it
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they've got the right amount of food,
they fight for themselves and they do a
[SPEAKER_09]: magnificent job.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to give them what they want.
[SPEAKER_09]: They need food.
[SPEAKER_09]: They need attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: They need love.
[SPEAKER_09]: They reward you with the medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a simple paradigm.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your Instagram handle, Intra?
[SPEAKER_09]: Say again?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your Instagram handle for those who
want to check it out?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's under pure extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: John Davis on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was envisioning a rabbit poo clone puck.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rabbit poo is the very best stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've grown everything in it and everything
likes it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing doesn't like rabbit poo,
except for I wouldn't want to bathe in it
[SPEAKER_09]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as all my plants go,
my tomatoes... That's a good idea to bathe
[SPEAKER_05]: in it probably.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it might actually be okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_09]: But it'll be a while before I give that a
try though.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the plants go, I bathe them
in it and I do a lot of things that other
[SPEAKER_09]: people don't do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe in foliar feeding because
I think foliar feeding when you're
[SPEAKER_09]: spraying manure on plant leaves is the
primary cause of starting mold and other
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff to grow up in your leaf system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, during the season, I water my
whole plant from the top down a few times
[SPEAKER_09]: and keeps everything off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just take good care of them and I keep
doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every three days, I put rabbit poo tea in
with them and it doesn't burn and they
[SPEAKER_09]: just keep producing more and more
trichomes and by the way, my CBD plants
[SPEAKER_09]: are just eating that rabbit poo tea up
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not seen CBD buds like I've seen on
the two CBD plants I'm growing this year
[SPEAKER_09]: from feeding them the rabbit poo tea.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what all is in rabbit poo
exactly, but I've been using it for 58
[SPEAKER_09]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably has a lot to do with what's
getting fed to the rabbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I bet you that rabbit poo is
full of rabbit shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were going to say that,
Tim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim knows stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about rabbit poo as well
is that the rabbits have an immaculate
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive system so that no seeds pass
through their manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed them almost anything,
seeded plants, and then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a really high phosphorus in that
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever there's seeds or flower heads,
then that's pulled out all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus out of the soil and the green
plants are going to be working on your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually feed your rabbits in
conjunction with what's going on with your
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and you're not going to be
transmitting any seeds into your gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your whole garden, cover crop it and
then rabbit tractor it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rabbit tractor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use 50% rabbit poo.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use 30% really good soil that I mix up
myself, but I mix it out of good things,
[SPEAKER_09]: not crap, no chemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I use a 10% oak leaf mulch and I put
in a little blood meal and a little bone
[SPEAKER_09]: meal and I throw in a small handful of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plants, I've never had a year when
they didn't almost try to get out of hand
[SPEAKER_09]: size-wise.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time when we started growing
them in the ground wheat, we grew them up
[SPEAKER_09]: five feet tall and then we stripped all
the leaves off of it, covered it with root
[SPEAKER_09]: tone, and buried it in a five foot deep
hole.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing happened for weeks and weeks and
weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then finally one day we went up and there
was a three foot tall plant there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then four or five days later, there was a
10 foot tall plant there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Changing that root, changing that part of
the plant into a root was a big plus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we started feeding more rabbit poo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I came across the idea of splitting
the stock in four and laying them down and
[SPEAKER_09]: just growing branches, not growing any
more top or any more main stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you just grow branches, all of your
buds look the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you grow 200 pounds, all 200 pounds
look the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an extremely good method.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plants respond well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put them in 600 gallon bags when I'm
growing in a season and half of that is
[SPEAKER_09]: the rabbit poo.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are thinking, wow,
you can't put that much fertilizer in,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I've been doing it for 56 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me and Annie grew it forever in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a complete and total church of
rabbit poo members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, rabbit poo is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that rabbit manure is definitely
one of the best things that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in BC, we all dream about rabbit
tractors, but we also have grizzly bears
[SPEAKER_00]: and black bears.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grizzly bears love those damn things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love to have a whole basket full of
rabbits for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are furry loving little creatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably add a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about rabbit manure and also
sheep manure because of their diet is that
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people in France and people who
are growing lavender farms and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing it for distillate for
perfumeries is that they love sheep manure
[SPEAKER_00]: and rabbit manure because of the terpenes
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that it does bring out
terpenes in your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use sheep's wool for mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rabbit manure is also already
pre-digested enough that it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to re-compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's such a fantastic addition
into your pots or into your soil layering.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where I learned about it exactly was I was
extracting lavender for Roberti for seven
[SPEAKER_09]: years in our plant in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their main scientist, Dr. Daniel Julian
flew over on a jet to come see our factory
[SPEAKER_09]: when we got it built up in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_09]: He related the story of how they use
rabbit poo with the lavender.
[SPEAKER_09]: To bring out the oils?
[SPEAKER_09]: To bring out the oils, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I managed to get into Roberti's supply
line by bugging them for two years about
[SPEAKER_09]: extracting some lavender.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't ever pay attention to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, to get rid of me, they sent me a
package of three-year-old lavender flowers
[SPEAKER_09]: and said, okay, when you can extract this
and we like it, we'll call you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, you don't call back anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I extracted it and four days later,
I got this crazy French guy on the phone
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to speak English and French mixed
up at the same time, telling me it was the
[SPEAKER_09]: best lavender extract he ever saw in his
life.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted to know how in the world they
did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lifelong relationship with Dr. Julian,
a 20-year-long relationship with him
[SPEAKER_09]: figured big time into what I know about
flavor and fragrance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to work with him for a very long
time and I can tell you that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: more to the rabbit poo than we really even
know about.
[SPEAKER_09]: At Roberti, they studied it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever it is that the rabbit's,
what you call an immaculate diet is
[SPEAKER_09]: usually alfalfa and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, unfortunately, glyphosate too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't been showing up yet,
but maybe it shows up in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it shows up in rabbit dung and there's
been studies that have been done on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually one of the concerns about
using it is again, rabbits will eat just
[SPEAKER_01]: about anything foliar and glyphosate does
pass through their system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's too late, Mark, because they've
already found that same crap in mother's
[SPEAKER_09]: breast milk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little late to be worrying about
what rabbit poo does at this point in
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that, unfortunately,
people have studied glyphosate in rabbit
[SPEAKER_01]: poo, but they've studied glyphosate in
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one diet of commercial rabbits
is often alfalfa pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa pellets are being tremendously
sprayed by glyphosate as well as GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing your inputs is crucial.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is easy to raise your own
rabbits because you can actually take a
[SPEAKER_00]: small little rabbit tractor right along
your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only even have a small lawn and you
can create a tremendous amount of rabbit
[SPEAKER_00]: manure in a really small space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, there's a lot of
totally organic rabbit meat farms around
[SPEAKER_09]: and that are springing up that only feed
their rabbits the stuff that they grow
[SPEAKER_09]: that is organic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been using some of them for years and
some of them you go to them and the way
[SPEAKER_09]: they take care of the rabbits is
heartwarming.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recommend anything commercial
because everything that's been
[SPEAKER_09]: commercialized, unfortunately,
at this point in time has been left me
[SPEAKER_09]: wanting for the most part.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't use any chemicals or stuff in any
of the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, I've been extracting for a long
time and the fact that insecticides and
[SPEAKER_09]: sulfur compounds and microbutanol and
other stuff started showing up in the
[SPEAKER_09]: plants is a very disturbing trend.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to defeat it by putting
filtration systems in our system that gets
[SPEAKER_09]: rid of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish everybody out there would stop with
the spraying of bug spray.
[SPEAKER_09]: and powdery mildew spray and stuff on the
plants because people have to ingest this
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to make a dollar,
but if you're going to make a dollar and
[SPEAKER_09]: cause more discomfort and more upset,
I think you should try to find something
[SPEAKER_09]: else to do with your time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't call it medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You read the recent report by Steep Hill
where they're talking about 86% of all the
[SPEAKER_10]: clones tested were contaminated with
pesticides or pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saw that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an IPFM, we call it an integrated
pest and fungal management program that we
[SPEAKER_05]: put out to the community, anyone that asks
us about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Predator mites and predators are so darn
easy to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really something you use in a
cloning situation as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to feel like the only clean
clones out there are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually come with predators.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had to destroy 53% of our extract
and donate extract from organic farms this
[SPEAKER_08]: year for microbutanol.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of those come with flower tests that
show clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as we take that and extract it,
all of a sudden it starts popping.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a real problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people get upset when we share
those results back to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing I can do about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the good things is it's caused
people to really question their clone
[SPEAKER_08]: sources and the nursery practices a little
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping this isn't as big a problem as
it is these last couple of years in the
[SPEAKER_08]: future.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We make a nasal spray for kids with
epilepsy that really needs an high THC,
[SPEAKER_08]: low other compounds profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't been able to get one to test.
[SPEAKER_08]: The high THC gardens are just failing left
and right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't been able to get one to pass in
a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, with the nasal spray,
we want the highest THC ratio we can
[SPEAKER_08]: because we want to use as little cannabis
oil as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to go down this rabbit hole,
but it has to do with the viscosity and
[SPEAKER_08]: being able to aerosolize.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lower the percentage, the more oil you
have to put in, which ends up making it
[SPEAKER_08]: thicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thought behind it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can supply you with some of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I have a process that I use,
that I've developed, to take very thick
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis oil and make it very motile.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to drive up and we need to visit
here soon, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing that I wanted to mention
here is that was the reason why us and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other community members created the
peer certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes beyond OMRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes beyond NOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to find flowers of people that
have a peer certification, it means that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're only growing off of a closed loop
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the clones are made there on their
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the seeds are made there on their
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the inputs are all what they have
created on their own property to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: totally closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing their inputs that come from off of
their property and working together as a
[SPEAKER_05]: community and working together to keep the
medicine clean and knowing our sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the peer certification community,
everyone's communicating with each other
[SPEAKER_05]: on how to create the cleanest medicine for
the masses, for the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's flowers and concentrates are
coming up totally pure, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way that the community can help one
another and step outside of the current
[SPEAKER_00]: organic standards that are going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's obviously needed.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that's needed is we need
to take each one of these compounds,
[SPEAKER_10]: both pesticides and fungicides,
and spray a mother plant, grow it big,
[SPEAKER_10]: test it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it comes out contaminated, make clones
from it as a big mother plant before we
[SPEAKER_10]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Test the clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: If those are contaminated, clones those
clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Test until we can find out how many
generations does it really take to get rid
[SPEAKER_10]: of these goddamn things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a warning for growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: If people realize this, they're much less
likely to have anything to do with them in
[SPEAKER_10]: any way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's powerful because you're not making a
dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Indra was saying, I believe people
are like, I'm going to tweak this out and
[SPEAKER_05]: make a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you end up losing a dollar and making
people sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really powerful wake up call for
recreational farms to not become W-R-E-C-K
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very insidious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then not spraying it again for three
years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three years down the road, take a sample
of the soil in your greenhouse and it'll
[SPEAKER_09]: still be severely contaminated with the
spray from three years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: That depends on what the spray is.
[SPEAKER_10]: All soil doesn't become contaminated
forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both ultraviolet light and just soil
microorganisms can disperse and destroy
[SPEAKER_10]: the some of these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working with some farms that did use
pesticides and some chemical fertilizers
[SPEAKER_05]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have been using Korean natural
farming and also just closed loop systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another aspect of closed loop systems that
work is the part of having a closed loop
[SPEAKER_05]: is that you're digesting organic material
and you're doing that with microorganisms
[SPEAKER_05]: that clean the land and transform those
terrible compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we would ever know exactly
how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that they're very vigorous
compounds to get rid of, but so are some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the remediating compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting some soil tests back that
are showing clean after one year,
[SPEAKER_05]: two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're showing some promise on that and
we're looking deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using pretty serious micro
remediation with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think not that many people grow in the
ground, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm interested in is showing the
mother clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you've sprayed them, are they really
safe to use that year?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they really safe to make clones for
the next year's crop?
[SPEAKER_10]: That wouldn't be that hard to do the
science with it, but it hasn't been done
[SPEAKER_10]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be contaminating your land.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know for me, I would be like,
oh shit, I'd have to ... It can be done
[SPEAKER_10]: indoors under lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably be a good idea for someone to get
on it eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far does it pass?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a frightening thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's true, is that people who grow
on this stuff should have to pay for the
[SPEAKER_02]: testing of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my point of view, the pharmaceutical
companies and the chemical companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: make fungicides and pesticides are running
an ongoing science experiment on humans
[SPEAKER_02]: and our environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one of the things that
cannabis can do for us as a culture is
[SPEAKER_02]: help us understand that all these
compounds we're putting into our
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, putting into our bodies,
putting on the plants that we eat,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving to the animals that we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the guinea pigs in a giant
experiment, is my point of view.
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally agree with you, but that
said, the majority of Americans eat
[SPEAKER_10]: chemically grown food and GMO corn,
GMO, everything else.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to put such a burden on cannabis.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the guinea pigs are probably
insulted by that, don't you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not saying that we are all pigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm poking fun at the euphemism guinea
pig.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a point of view about what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early organic chemists who first
worked out that oil petroleum could be
[SPEAKER_02]: used to make fertilizer, for example,
or weapons, recognized that their lab
[SPEAKER_02]: assistants were coming subject to all
kinds of cancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided that it wasn't really going
to be that big a problem because medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: would solve the problem by the time it
became an issue in the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my point of view, it's still going on
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really putting all these compounds
out there like glyphosate, because it has
[SPEAKER_02]: some properties about being able to kill
plants as if that's a benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conversation that we're having that I
think is really important is that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: really want medicinal cannabis,
cannabis that you can assure the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're providing it to is clean and
free of issues, you really have to follow
[SPEAKER_02]: these practices of sourcing everything
from your own work, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: your own place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very fortunate to have a piece of
land where I've got enough space to have
[SPEAKER_02]: begun the process that the folks at
Dragonfly Farms are exemplifying so
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the mushrooms play a part in it,
but a really huge thing is sourcing the
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs that you're using in all these
various processes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wade, don't you find that everybody,
every large grower has gotten clones from
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get clones from other people,
but they're always suspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to recognize that the plants that I
work with, if I haven't bred them and
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten them here myself, or that I'm
working with someone that I can trust the
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings they're providing are clean,
that that plant, if it's not my plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, in this work that I've been doing for
years, one of the things that's happened
[SPEAKER_02]: is people have gifted me examples of
things that they've found that might be of
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than a few times, though,
it turned out they were of benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of why I feel so interested in
how different cultivars respond to the
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances that I'm able to give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to refine the circumstances,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the reasons I'm interested
in how many generations can you clone a
[SPEAKER_10]: mother plant and then a clone of the clone
and a clone of the clone before there is
[SPEAKER_10]: no parts per trillion, parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's truly cleaned up again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be even more interesting
to try different soil recipes in on that,
[SPEAKER_05]: and different foliar recipes, and just to
see what different techniques you could
[SPEAKER_05]: use to speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe that it would be different
based off whatever environment you were
[SPEAKER_05]: using.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it could be environmental,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or possibly even strain, as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wonder if the hazes or some of
the land raises would get through it
[SPEAKER_05]: faster because their genetics are closer
to the earth, and maybe the hybrids would
[SPEAKER_05]: hang onto it more.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just made up in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, maybe like viruses, if you took just
the very, very top atypical miers tips,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe they wouldn't have the contaminants
or viruses in them yet, and then reproduce
[SPEAKER_10]: them by in vitro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens when you plant corn,
take the corn that you can buy now,
[SPEAKER_09]: corn seed, and go out and plant it,
and don't spray it, and don't put
[SPEAKER_09]: glycosphosphate on it, and don't do any of
the petrochemical stuff you have to do,
[SPEAKER_09]: and just watch it grow on its own in the
wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think you get?
[SPEAKER_05]: A smaller corn plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very much smaller, and probably not a
survivable plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea that we could put enough poison
in our food to fend off other stuff is a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like putting all of us on
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's making a kind of a crazy assumption,
which it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the world needs food, but there's
been many, many studies showing that
[SPEAKER_09]: organically grown food can be grown on a
large enough scale to provide the food
[SPEAKER_09]: without the petrochemical thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the plants that rely on
petrochemicals, if you try to grow them on
[SPEAKER_09]: their own without anything except rain,
fail dismally.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like one season away from starving
to death, and people don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens if the petrochemicals aren't
available one year, all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're looking at all the crops
putting out next to nothing are dying off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a dangerous spot we put
ourselves in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, we should be making our plant
stock strong, healthy, organic,
[SPEAKER_09]: able to put up with things without
petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is available.
[SPEAKER_10]: All you have to do is use heirloom
varieties and join groups like the Seed
[SPEAKER_10]: Savers Exchange.
[SPEAKER_10]: They pass around heirloom varieties
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time I buy the seeds in the little
seed vault thing so that I have them in
[SPEAKER_09]: case of a zombie apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have all the dried organic food and
stuff in case of a zombie apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still, all in all, the people who produce
the majority of the food are not doing
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the stuff that we've got going on
in our bodies as a result of these
[SPEAKER_09]: petrochemicals being in our food,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want you to smoke anything that
might have insecticide on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a tomato that is so loaded with
chemicals that bugs try to eat it and die
[SPEAKER_09]: and fall off on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to let you know butane is a
petrochemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be accurate, we don't use
petrochemicals as crop protection agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungicides and insecticides are not
petrochemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be petrochemical-based,
but that's really irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not irrelevant when you're putting it
on the food, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying just to be accurate,
petrochemicals are chemicals that derive
[SPEAKER_01]: petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us rely on infrastructure and
airplanes and automobiles and trains that
[SPEAKER_01]: all need petrochemicals to push things
through the sky and over the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks that we burn a lot of
petrochemicals and we burn a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: gasoline, but all that organic food still
uses a lot of petrochemicals in all the
[SPEAKER_01]: refrigeration required for it and all the
impact that society, let's face it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're addicted to oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is yeah, I'm not saying that
this is how it has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be forever, but as long as
there's cheap oil, the reason why a head
[SPEAKER_01]: of lettuce costs $1.99 at the grocery
store is because they're able to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: it cheaply and that's what the working
family could afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't afford a $8 head of lettuce at
the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that organic is going to be
$8 a head, but the point is that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The controls now that prepare food in
very, very large quantities use these
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, use microfuel, use all the
chemicals that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we have an environmental
protection agency was to register the
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredients for those uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've been stymied by the current
administration because the current
[SPEAKER_01]: director of the EPA will not allow even
companies to approach them with a
[SPEAKER_01]: registration for use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, cannabis is left in the dark
because they're not going to regulate just
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that it's federally illegal and
none of these companies can basically make
[SPEAKER_01]: a product with any claims on it or
register it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get it registered, the thing
about that is typically with the EPA is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to show both safety and
efficacy so you have to show that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: intended market, like if you're intending
this to be sprayed on food or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is safe and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things, what makes a crop
protection chemical today is one that
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks down and is very, very safe and has
a very, very safe profile, but it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: effective at controlling the cornworm or
whatever they're applying it to be used
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_10]: The opposite of systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're using now is active on grams
per acre as opposed to kilograms per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were the large broadcasted DDT and
things where they were just spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: entire fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they can reduce the amount that
they're spraying, but now what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding again with some of these new
things like the neonics, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's having deleterious impact on
off-target insects like the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows about colony collapse
disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the things that again is
problematic with the use of things like
[SPEAKER_01]: imidacloprid, which has a really human
safety thing, which is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers were concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, if we spray this on produce,
are people gonna get cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people gonna crawl over?
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out people aren't at the use
rates that they're using it because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very effective at low use rates,
but now after it's been used for 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 15 years, they're finding now this
off-target, just like with glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_01]: With glyphosate, the target enzyme in
glyphosate is something called EPSP
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which has to do with the chikimate pathway
to make aromatic amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It completely inhibits that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that doesn't have an impact on
mammals and humans or mammals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what it does have an impact on is the
gut bacteria that's in our gut and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: gut of other animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these rabbits are foraging and
they're foraging in fields that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't sprayed directly with glyphosate,
but maybe it was sprayed downstream from
[SPEAKER_01]: where there was either drift or erosion
and there could be, again, persistence of
[SPEAKER_01]: glyphosate in any environment,
but most ad chemicals today will
[SPEAKER_01]: microbially and physically degrade in the
environment by the time that produce makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it to market and there's no residuals or
whatever residuals on the produce they've
[SPEAKER_01]: done tests to show that human exposure at
those levels, even chronic exposure,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not problematic, but none of this has
been done with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, cannabis, unlike produce,
is not washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least most of us don't wash cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Mark and all the hash makers,
oh no, dude, we wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but the point is is that you don't
normally wash cannabis, but anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: is hydrocarbon-like is the best way to
describe it, Indra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not petrochemicals, but most of
these active ingredients that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop protection chemicals today are very
fat-soluble, will stick to the trichome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and will end up concentrating in any
concentration process, and so you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: see it in the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Forrest was saying, when they tested
flour, it came back clean, but lo and
[SPEAKER_01]: behold, we test to concentrate,
and now it's coming up because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrating it, so the last point I'll
make is, this goes back to the smokey
[SPEAKER_01]: comment earlier that Subcool was making,
which is if you distill it, and if the
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation is done in the right way,
theoretically, you could remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids from anything that's left
behind, including pesticide residuals or
[SPEAKER_01]: smokey-tasting residuals, so this will be
the year of the distillate, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because of all the fires that are
happening out west.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll see a lot of, I know just
from, my phone's been ringing off the
[SPEAKER_01]: hook, a lot of interest in making
distillates this year, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're guaranteed, if there's that
many people making distillate,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's gonna be some smokey distillate in
some of these pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it'll be really hard to
identify what those smokey compounds are,
[SPEAKER_01]: because actually, some of the smokey
compounds are actually plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators, in that the essence of what
the Forrest released, when it does burn,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually initiates new seed germination,
so some of those compounds have actually
[SPEAKER_01]: been explored as plant growth regulators,
and things that upregulate things for seed
[SPEAKER_01]: germination that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, discussing what you were just
talking about with organic foods,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you bring a refractometer into a health
food store, and you're testing the ratings
[SPEAKER_00]: on a lot of these foods, they really
actually have zero nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these organic foods that are even
local in our area that we feel like are
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy and good for us,
are coming up really low on the
[SPEAKER_00]: refractometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of nutrient-dense food is
starting to become a thing of the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless we really take a hold of this,
and start adding and re-adding minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: into our soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take a little garlic press to the
store, or to your cannabis farms,
[SPEAKER_05]: or to the place where you're getting your
alfalfa, and just press a drip out onto
[SPEAKER_05]: the refractometer, and make that decision
on where you're gonna get your alfalfa
[SPEAKER_05]: from, or your chard, or your carrots,
or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one way of testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even just with us here out on our
farm, we feel like we have an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all closed-loop systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we put into our farm is
from our farm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we first started here 10 years
ago, our vegetables and fruits were very
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, over time, by adding a lot of
minerals into the soil, adding more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more leaf material, oak leaf, maple leaf,
these kinds of things that our nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: density is raising up a lot higher in our
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of just organic doesn't really
mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, also, organic means that it
has a tremendous amount of blood and bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to organic farmers, and their
number one and number two ingredients that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're adding into their soil is blood
and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you test that blood and bone
meal, it may be registered for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: use, but it isn't organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a loophole that people are
continuously using in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and also in the organic food
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would also like to say we do use
plastic for our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, we have no other
inputs coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're growing amazing food.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're just using it so you don't
have to go for petrochemicals or nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or hydrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just taking the weeds that we're
weeding out of our garden and putting them
[SPEAKER_05]: into water, liquefying them, and watering
them back into the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have the biggest plants in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just saying, they're big.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have amazing food and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't wait to harvest our squash
patch because it's like phenomenal,
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can be done on large scales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And organic isn't necessarily the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a community, we really need to
challenge ourselves to do more in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: save.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about closed loop vegetables and
fruits so that we know that the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: remineralizing by utilizing what they're
taking off of their farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I'll tell you, we've done this
earthen pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to figure some shit out here in the
next couple of generations because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: very crucial.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually really simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called give more than you pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give more than you take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, even organic
farming is that they're taking a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: even even farms that maybe utilizing,
you know, maybe their cover crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but they're still growing it out
of the same soil so that those cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: can only uptake what's in the soil
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're not giving back to the soil
and continuously taking from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cover crops are good at fixing nitrogen,
too, from the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you said earlier, Sam,
that takes a few years to really kick in.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely true, because I've been
in organic biodynamic farming since 1972.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it takes time to build up
really, really nice soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's work worth doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in California, there's actually
funding for farmers to build soil content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're really talking about is
the same sort of thing we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: is trying to add organic content to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you're a cannabis farmer,
they're not willing to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to sign off here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to say thank you,
Marcus, for what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Forrest, I'd like to go with you to
see Indra.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Indra, I'd like to look forward to
meeting you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a fun road trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all of you for this information
and the work you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learn something here every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It blows me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming out, Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming out and spending some
time with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks so much, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate everything that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we sent you an email last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I haven't found it, if you don't
hear from me in a few days, please bounce
[SPEAKER_02]: with me another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically, we just want to know how
we can support you and Forrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the base of it and how we
can continue your gardens and then in turn
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to support Forrest and what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 100% behind you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever we can do, we're in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that sounds like another trip that
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come on up to Canada, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there for that trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to happen the next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cladrius Network World Tour.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Canada has a federal
program, so you could get into some pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good spots, I think, to get that
information out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've been looking at a few events
and we'll talk about this another time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we're going to time it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe for next summer when there's some
things going on and helpful to cause,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's so much information out there
these days that people actually have a
[SPEAKER_03]: hard time finding the good information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is if you can imagine a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why it's good to push that good
information up to the top every time you
[SPEAKER_03]: find it, get it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it a little bit easier for
people to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I'm so deep into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it doesn't seem that hard to find
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know so many of the histories and so
many of the backgrounds of where the
[SPEAKER_03]: information is coming from that that is
also very helpful to know what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: what the quality of the information that
you're getting is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think once you have a good
foundational understanding, you're able to
[SPEAKER_08]: sift through things more quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you don't waste a lot of time on
bad, you know, papers and articles and
[SPEAKER_08]: info.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's getting people up to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That level where they can just be
competent enough to be able to sift
[SPEAKER_08]: through some of the nonsense that is the,
you know, negative part of the wonderful
[SPEAKER_08]: thing we call the Internet and free
information, you know, which is even doing
[SPEAKER_03]: research on the sites that are releasing
that information in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like there's definitely like,
you know, is it a trusted source of
[SPEAKER_03]: information or is it one of these sort of
just like people fishing for.
[SPEAKER_03]: For traction, just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily sharing truths.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had one question that got posted a
few times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Mark, if you want to talk
about it here on the side chat,
[SPEAKER_08]: because they asked a few times about
cancer and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Preventative cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, they were asking for was research
reference articles that dealt with that
[SPEAKER_10]: issue, and I think some of the better ones
are coming out of space.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for those who can't read the
question, the question is, is there
[SPEAKER_08]: evidence for cannabis as a preventative
medicine against cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unequivocally, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: patent on cannabis proves it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does have neuroprotective activity
in that it's a fat soluble antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it deposits into fatty tissue like the
brain and it quench its free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free radicals form mutations that lead
into cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does so in the pancreas and does so in
the liver as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that it does in the liver,
we were talking about CBD before.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that CBD how CBD works
is it lowers the metabolic activity of
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic degradation of other components
in the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it basically inhibits what's called
cytochrome P450 and related oxidase
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes in the liver that basically start
creating all kinds of things in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the activity that CBD has,
it basically lowers the degradation of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's already in your blood.
[SPEAKER_10]: A good example of that is with THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: You take CBD and THC together and it makes
the combo last longer, the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and I think that although there's
not papers on this, that what we know
[SPEAKER_08]: about how cannabinoids interact with the
CB2 receptor, how they trigger apoptosis
[SPEAKER_08]: and other cell death cycles, cancer is
happening in our bodies all the time and
[SPEAKER_08]: our bodies are fighting them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So supplements of these cannabinoids,
although I don't have a reference paper to
[SPEAKER_08]: point you to,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it would suggest that any assistance
you can have in triggering that system in
[SPEAKER_08]: cancer cells in the body is going to be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also antiangiogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that tumors survive is in the
what's called extracellular matrix,
[SPEAKER_01]: they emit growth factor and the growth
factor stimulates blood cell or blood
[SPEAKER_01]: vessel formation from an existing artery
or existing vein or capillary to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: sprout a new artery or vein to the tumor
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you could inhibit the tumor's
ability to reroute vascular plumb to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, it's one way of choking tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's anti, it's also an
anti-proliferative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've also shown, and this is
primarily work by Manuel Guzman,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was probably Sam arguably the lead
researcher in terms of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: their impact on cancer and actually
looking to see molecular mechanisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental markers that show the impact
that cannabinoids have on tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, anecdotally, you go to the
internet and you'll see, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Simpson oil, you put it on a tumor,
you keep putting it on, eventually it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is something about this that,
you know, cannabinoids do have basically
[SPEAKER_01]: make cancer go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a cure for cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be defined, I think,
more in the terms that medical science can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see it in terms of dosing and
understanding what the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine in terms of form and delivery is
a very, very key thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I've said this before many
times on church, I think the US
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry has got the world
believing that whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a pill for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, it's like you have to get
beyond that paradigm of something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to eat, that you're going to
ingest, that's going to go down into your
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach, that's going to dissolve and have
some miraculous effect on your health.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if cancer is here, you put the
medicine here on your arm, if that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, localized delivery, is really,
really important because cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we know, are not very water soluble,
so they have to be delivered in such a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can get to where they're
basically going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we see, I hear people,
some of the people who come and ask for
[SPEAKER_08]: help, they're saying, well, we're thinking
about cannabis, but the type of cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have doesn't really respond well
to chemotherapy, our doctor said,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they said they might have these new
drugs that help block the blood flow to
[SPEAKER_08]: the cells and they actually cause them to
die by some word.
[SPEAKER_08]: They trigger it, they trigger the cell
death.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like, well, that's exactly what we
do know, and we're still learning new
[SPEAKER_08]: things it does, but what things we're
certain about, that's what cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It blocks blood flow, so it slows the
duplication of these rapidly duplicating
[SPEAKER_08]: cells and it causes them to have a
lifespan and kind of takes away their
[SPEAKER_08]: immortality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's essentially what cancer is,
is this rapid duplicating non-dying cell
[SPEAKER_08]: until it kills you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's great to see that people are
starting to understand that little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: better, but it's kind of sad when,
you know, they're not being encouraged to
[SPEAKER_08]: at least try it as a benefit, you know,
not necessarily a cure, but something that
[SPEAKER_08]: could be beneficial and told to hold off
for the new, this pharmaceutical drug that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're trying to design that does the
exact same thing, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I wanted to mention
too is the fact that cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptogenic, you know, along with a lot of
other plants in, in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant kingdom as well as a lot in
micro, mycology, you know, mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_00]: also an adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis decides, you know,
a lot of times when people utilize it,
[SPEAKER_00]: with our immune systems, with our own
intelligence and our own bodily
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence, it really decides on how
it's going to help and heal us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that adaptogenic in our
body, it also becomes an adaptogenic to
[SPEAKER_00]: our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that cannabis helps us make
better decisions because it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes us more adaptable beings on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, which I think, you know,
it's giving us a higher intelligence along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the other adaptogenic mushrooms and,
you know, vegetation that's given directly
[SPEAKER_00]: by mother nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really got to just feed your immune
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, number one, and it's all the
things we can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just how many can we find that are immune
boosting?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's, that's along with the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allying with these adaptogenic things
that mother nature has given to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think there's a connection to
music?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm, I'm, I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played music, I think just about the
same time as I've been getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been getting high just as long as
I've been playing music.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the two things are very
connected and I, what I get from one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I put into the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that like my spirituality and my
ability to reach to other people has to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with both the plant, but both music too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's like there's this universe
that's been created that creates,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like when I express myself in my
music, I'm doing so because my cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors are firing and I'm John Coltrane
and I'm trying to let it come out,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best Garcia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like letting it go, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I look out in the audience
and I see like this dude just totally like
[SPEAKER_01]: doing his thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just took a hit of some weed and
he's just, he's getting into it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, to me, I'm connecting with
this guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, I don't even know this dude,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're connecting and for that moment,
like we're on a different level of
[SPEAKER_01]: spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's like, yeah,
it's like, I always tell people it got us
[SPEAKER_01]: drawn on the walls of the cave and what
got, you know, musicians, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially jazz musicians when they
realized that maybe it mean the stress of
[SPEAKER_01]: life and the stress of the world's around
them, they could just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it just comes out
in triple bars and comes out in sheets
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're able to kind of de-stress
themselves to bring things down to where
[SPEAKER_01]: their creativity just overflows into that
other space that may not have been there
[SPEAKER_01]: if you didn't consume, you know,
I don't know, maybe it just may.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you stimulate your immune system,
you're going to stimulate all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: happy receptors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I just can't see,
you know, in separating recreational from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, medicinal de-stressing,
you know, I mean, last night we did a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a test trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a gathering with our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a really small community and we
handed out probably over 30 joints to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, it was the best party
that we ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like a lot of people who might
not normally smoke or people who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, might be smoking something
that's not so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really everybody was hugging one
another last night and it was like an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to come together through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: People love free joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are nice joints too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like fatays.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I would say those were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are Canadian joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would they be fatays?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fat, fatays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, it's about time.
[SPEAKER_08]: My time has come to an end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got appointments starting at noon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to thank you for having me
on again and I will see you guys next
[SPEAKER_08]: time.

close here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank everyone for coming

good conversation into our third year here
[SPEAKER_03]: on Hash Church and we will see you all
