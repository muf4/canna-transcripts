[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
I'm here today with a new product from D
[SPEAKER_01]: nail that's actually a new old product
These guys sent me one of these it's gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: be six months to a year ago, and it was
one of my favorite Nails or you know dab
[SPEAKER_01]: tools if you will that I've ever hit and I
think it has a lot to do with the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all what I'm talking about is the
deep Or not the deep The dog dish the
[SPEAKER_01]: doghouse dish So this is the doghouse dish
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you guys a little close-up on it
So you can kind of get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's what she looks like if it's
a 20 mil Coil and it's at a 45 degree
[SPEAKER_01]: angle this time last time it went all the
way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about like a 180 So it sits at a
different angle in the pipe Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: totally okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, and I'll show you it also came
with a cool little pickaxe Little Beagle
[SPEAKER_01]: was having a bad day apparently that day
and he decided he would make a pickaxe and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pickaxe of course is the dabber and
The carb it goes right in there and carbs
[SPEAKER_01]: that up So today, I've got a few pieces on
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my D now all set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's about 266 degrees right now
and so that's as simple as that Let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: for an egg hit first Let that drop down
nice at the angle You can see it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: the side opens perfectly for a real nice
hit now The reason I think that this unit
[SPEAKER_01]: is so nice and why it hits a little bit
differently from most everything else is
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else I've hit from D nail is
open The whole top is open or you know
[SPEAKER_01]: almost always the whole yeah I've got this
hooked up to my Faberge egg and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to take you guys through a
little rip I've got three different rips
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some really nice dry sir from
default 20k this is the last of the last
[SPEAKER_01]: that I found from a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me ages ago Took some macro
photographs of this and it just looks
[SPEAKER_01]: surreal the way it pressed out in the
parchment paper I've got some really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash here The flavor on the dry
sift is og Kush the flavor on the bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash Lo and behold is og Kush I'm taking
one tiny little dab of Horatio's LHO and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't tell you what the strength Strain is
with this particular batch, but I've just
[SPEAKER_01]: got a tiny tiny little bit But I thought
it would be cool if we hit some dry sift
[SPEAKER_01]: some bubble hash And some LHO all through
the deep dish or sorry the dog house D now
[SPEAKER_01]: also also has another bowl called the deep
dish and that's that's a completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different unit It's open at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not completely sealed with a little
hole in the side So this is the one we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be going through today, and I'm just
gonna let this get heated up a tiny little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit It's probably good to go Oh a little
picket a little picket in my pocket here a
[SPEAKER_01]: little dabber So let's go hit that little
bit of LHO for starters out of the Faberge
[SPEAKER_01]: egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks courtesy of high integrity glass
art and Yeah, this is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of turn that angle if you
want to hit it real nice and just Here we
[SPEAKER_01]: go dog house
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Very tasty nice small rip of the
LHO Always always a pleasure Hitting that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the distillate of Horatio's so
it's really smooth and and it's just Fully
[SPEAKER_01]: activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a real true medicine In
regards to cannabis next up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the bubble hash in the dry sift
I think I'm gonna hit the bubs first and
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the dry sift last the dry sift just
looks so so darn nice Such a nice little
[SPEAKER_01]: treat See what we can get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just gumming up in the Sun here
try to get a nice substantial Substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: hit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got wasps lining all over me if I
look like I'm doing a dance every once in
[SPEAKER_01]: a while It's because wasps Are actually
all over the place This summer they've
[SPEAKER_01]: really yellow jackets have popped
everywhere I've killed probably ten in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last five minutes of filming this episode
and I see three already back for For more
[SPEAKER_01]: so I might have to pause the video and go
smack some wasp ass around But hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: not hopefully I leave them be they leave
me be that's pretty much easy enough All
[SPEAKER_01]: right Second rip this time a little bit
more substantial some bubble hash in in
[SPEAKER_01]: the doghouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor In the doghouse is just there's
something going on with the preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hit The way that the heat can't
burst off up and out you put the hit in
[SPEAKER_01]: and you literally have it sealed
immediately I'm sure it's more attuned to
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting with a carb cap where you put your
dab on your carb cap and then you drop it
[SPEAKER_01]: onto that nail whether it be quartz or
Titanium and you get this really nice sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of different type of hit Based on not
allowing that initial thrust of heat and
[SPEAKER_01]: and reaction to explode out of the top So
I think there's more to it than just
[SPEAKER_01]: catching the smoke or the vapor There's
also having that contained and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we love carb caps this to me
just seems like you know a brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: design because it's basically it's a carb
cap and a dabber in one and It's a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: function That's a little bit different
from most of the nails Like I say with
[SPEAKER_01]: that full open straight up and out the way
things want to go when they react on a hot
[SPEAKER_01]: nail So I guess we'll do one more rip here
Be nice if this just didn't roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take this and put it in the
torus one of the nice things about the
[SPEAKER_01]: doghouse dish is that It's really easy to
transfer almost as easy to transfer as a
[SPEAKER_01]: drop-down It doesn't get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull it out pretty easily and
Yeah, goes back in pretty nice so And as
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see it can be left-handed or
right-handed depending on how far you turn
[SPEAKER_01]: the the piece so let's See if we can't get
some of this dry sift in there It's dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna really have to shove it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the hole Yep, that's the one Like absolute
candy Wow
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I really love about the
doghouse is when I put a big rip through
[SPEAKER_01]: it like that It just it the Preservation
is like times 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even tell you the taste of how
candied out that that was there was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely I would say a little bit of the
Diesel the not the East Coast sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the New York City diesel this orange
sort of oranges Almost candy esque mix
[SPEAKER_01]: with these OG Kush and you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I found the bowl that he
gave me 11 different kinds in and 11
[SPEAKER_01]: different flaps so I guessed it was OG
Kush it tasted substantially like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: but You know hitting it through the the
doghouse like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something else going on there for
sure and It's very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took some lovely macro photographs of
the hash just a few shots to show you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: What what I'm dealing with here?
