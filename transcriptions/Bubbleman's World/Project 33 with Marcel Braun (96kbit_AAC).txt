[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Balla Man's World!
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here with Marcel Braun, a well-known
glassblower from the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: If any of you have been collecting glass
for any amount of time, you've definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: heard the name Marcel Braun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also here with Matt,
the house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today Marcel is here telling us about a
new project that he's working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a little more complicated than
just blowing a sick piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to kind of let him... Matt
just came in literally minutes ago to drop
[SPEAKER_05]: me off the tripod the camera is sitting on
right now because I spaced it last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Left it on the island.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Marcel was just about to explain to
Matt what this project is all about,
[SPEAKER_05]: which involves this box right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll pass it over to you Marcel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can sort of tell them about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the project is called Project 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a project designed to build a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it centers around creating awareness
about currency and the different ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's used to battle the building of
community and keep people imprisoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year I made the... The idea is to
create a community-based currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine somewhere between a festival
and a workshop where people... A spaceship
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to town, builds a dome around
itself, throws the party gates open,
[SPEAKER_00]: people come in, and essentially the cost
of admission is being exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: images and information that we have to
share about currency and permaculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: survivalism and just general...
[SPEAKER_00]: Human values that are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the activity is the local
glass artists and local musicians will be
[SPEAKER_00]: showcased on our stages and during the
midst of that there will be creation of
[SPEAKER_00]: currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the activity as a participant
is you'll be one of the people like
[SPEAKER_00]: polishing or slicing or stacking or on the
team pulling the millis for the currency,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are like these coins I have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so you're familiar with millis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with millis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a cane of glass that's been
sliced and polished that has an image on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so like a long cane and it's got the
image.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can show you one cane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the image on the end of the coin
when it's sliced, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Slicing it just like a loaf of bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that the community will be
enlisted in order to create these coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that it works is there will be
even like glass presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a line of people handing down
hot glass and pressing the currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the currency will be
able to be pre-ordered by people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the know to like have the working
assets and resources for the project to
[SPEAKER_00]: launch and to get to each location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the currency is produced it's
distributed to cover all those costs and
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that are needed for it to go to
its next location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the excess is given to the
people who have attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone leaves with a currency
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're exchanging their time for the
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea isn't that we're going to
back the currency per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have plenty of activities where we
will back the currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the thing you might be able to do
a metal coin press and go get a thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: fries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is more that people take the
currency out and use it to sell the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: to the outer world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each person that has a coin tries to
get what they can with it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea grows that we're
prisoners of our dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very wild concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the coins that you have
brought with you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all from the same cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different sizes to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even see the other sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking at the big ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even realize they were stacked so
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hitting some great Gartner resin
all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how can people get involved with
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can they, right away if someone was
watching and they were like, I want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: a part of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I be a part of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I acquire one of those coins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm not sure how to acquire one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These particular coins are just kind of
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were created at Project 33 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were meant to be the bank for the
first project.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were exchanged to sell the glass that
we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their intention is that they're the
seed to have the resources to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: first roll with the big hardware.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have a plan on putting these
out as that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like auctioning them off or getting people
involved to invest in these coins in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to get the project started?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do in the sense that I would like to
exchange them for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just open to, up to now I've
primarily given them away to people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt great gratitude for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been, I don't know if useful
is the right word for that, but certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's made me feel good from
time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for sure, I can see that because I
mean, from my perspective, just from
[SPEAKER_05]: hearing about this, I mean, I just,
you're a humble guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know for a fact if I photographed these
and put the idea on the website or on the
[SPEAKER_05]: internet and put it out in the world,
it would be a very short time before
[SPEAKER_05]: people were emailing me and being like,
how can I, how can I buy one?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the original project 33, they were a
thousand dollar coins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that project, someone could come in
and do some work, acquire a coin,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at that festival they could go
and buy a snack with that coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of what you're suggesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say they would do some work,
they would do an exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the festival we would set up at,
like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the example of we bring project 33
to a festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like a, it would be like a
side stage basically where people would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I was at Coachella once and
they had one of the whole stages at
[SPEAKER_01]: Coachella was run on human power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had all the batteries set up and
they had like rows and rows of like
[SPEAKER_01]: bicycles and they had like these hand
cranks and the entire weekend that DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, and behind the DJ stage they had
like a giant hamster wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's someone was like running on the
wheel all the time and they had huge
[SPEAKER_01]: storage batteries and they ran that stage
for the whole festival just off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: human power powering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool because you'd go at like four
in the morning and you'd see that guy on
[SPEAKER_01]: it just like.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first heard of this project,
I was more confused.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was something like,
okay, so you buy these coins, you get
[SPEAKER_05]: entry into this project that you create
this incredible piece of art and then that
[SPEAKER_05]: art is auctioned off and it raises more
money and it creates another project.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's similar to the concept.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's definitely neat and it's,
it's out of the box and it's definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: right up your alley.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're always a sort of pioneer
in the new ways of doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is great because not that the old
way of doing things isn't great either,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's just nice to have new choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like what I was saying to
Matt recently about why I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, your streams are all so amazing and
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, it's like, he took his own
ego out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of thinking that he was going to
be the one to choose all the best strains
[SPEAKER_05]: for like thousands of people who use it
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used all those thousands of people to
pick the strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got them to tell him what,
you know, that was a huge, that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge, with the HALMA strain, we asked the
members to choose like the top three
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes and it was completely different
from the one that I liked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point it was like, it was like
a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, holy cow, I know,
I know, you know, making these decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've learned it as a photographer,
the picture I think is the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't generally agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sometimes, and I'll do the
experiment, I'll be like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: post this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to post this one instead of this
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The odd time when it's perfect,
it's perfect and you know it's going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe many times I'm, that's just need
to get over your own ego and involve other
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked when you were talking about
doing that, I guess like a class where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're kind of teaching people how to do
the, the reticello.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would like, could you get like
custom make these for whatever festival?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the festival organizers came to you and
said, we want to implement this into our
[SPEAKER_01]: festival somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be a custom, custom thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm just, I just know,
and I'm not sure if you understand this,
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, in the glass world, like people
collect millies and not even ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure cause I'm kind of even
out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they're collecting them to
put them on future pieces or if they just
[SPEAKER_05]: want to keep them just as millies in like
cases, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm getting the thumbs up from the
big glass collector that's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying, yeah, one thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do, they do just for millies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, which means without even as a
currency, this is a currency because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel who made them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does get you thinking about
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime you can make an exchange,
where you're not, okay, so currency,
[SPEAKER_00]: currency is so evaluation of the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you originally print it, whoever
prints it gets the entire value of its
[SPEAKER_00]: worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as there's a pile of
currency sitting, it gets interest charged
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people start charging that fucking
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, the money is supposed to
represent the work that we all do as
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, our blood, our sweat, our tears,
our planet's ability to sustain life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people say they have all of it
and then they water it down by 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like pouring water into your dad's
vodka bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every time the interest gets added
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're just like, well,
because the bottle is full again and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have half of it, your half is now this
half and it's a watered down half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps happening and it's happened
so many times that they've just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: taken ownership of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime that that can be avoided,
where exchange can happen outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: currency, it's like it's at least taking
that one interaction away from the pile of
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions that's holding everyone down
as a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do more trades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the herb and the glass and the
hash guy sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are all things that have not
always just glass, but glass pipes in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular have had a foundation in the
herb community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously people are mostly smoking
cannabis with them, whether we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: pretend that they're smoking tobacco or
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of them are smoking cannabis
and it's part of the inspiration and the
[SPEAKER_05]: beauty of the art.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I always saw them so intricately
connected that it was true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you didn't really back in the day go
buy glass in like a store or a gallery.
[SPEAKER_05]: You bought it from like a blower if you
were lucky enough to know them or on like
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you can see pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys had pipes for sale and they were
very eager to trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I noticed is that people
started to collect and we all love trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as a maker, I noticed that
people tend to collect multiple pieces by
[SPEAKER_00]: me because they're in a sense investing in
me as a maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when you buy a piece for
me, then I get to make more pieces and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you want another piece and that
whole evolution of, you know, support,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a philanthropic sort of a vibe is
something that I think is really
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial on both sides of the equation,
both for collectors and for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see the sort of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sort of tell where you were by
that certain piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I was working on that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And share ownership in that and be like,
you know, I helped you get there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because it's like as an artist,
you're always looking to have that extra
[SPEAKER_00]: support to take your ideas to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is definitely a cool concept
and an idea and I can see it at its birth
[SPEAKER_05]: right now, but we'll see what it grows up
into.
[SPEAKER_05]: At a festival near you.
[SPEAKER_05]: At a festival, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming to a festival near you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Marcel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining us, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super good to see you and having you in
the house here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing the tribe home.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll see you in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with John B., who's just off camera
right now, but he is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: See?
[SPEAKER_04]: His hand is right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should move these real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't get that they were
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked like agates or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, welcome back to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a couple new guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost one guest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Flav421 in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel's still here and John B.,
who was just off camera in the last video.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's managed to make it over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He put some nice grapes on the table for
the effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta give John a shout out for his
grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have a grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the D-nail and some great gardener
dry sift on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel has his borosilicate coins or
borosilicoins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll coin them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just making shit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about it a little bit before.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably going to have a discussion
about it now, so we thought slap on the
[SPEAKER_05]: camcorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let everyone listen in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super beautiful day in British Columbia
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mountains in the background are just
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sun's flashing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's making plants grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the watermelon is joining us over by
John's subtle but there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to have you up here,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a whole new level of really
thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really getting to know about what you're
doing here is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we're talking about it since
Matt left.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really realizing the whole concept
behind of this new currency we were
[SPEAKER_03]: selling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have been in deep conversation
for the last half hour plus while we were
[SPEAKER_05]: setting all this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a little bit of a better grasp
on it, John.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you see it now?
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you... Do you have a short
explanation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Short explanation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about joining community and building
trade and getting back to being real and
[SPEAKER_03]: to getting away from paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more about... You're investing in
to say, I get one of those... The
[SPEAKER_03]: Starbucks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say this particular one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid $1,000 for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I have the Starbucks,
the value of it is what I see value with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say someone like Flav Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a cool pipe that he really wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really wants one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about value anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just talking about what we feel is
what it's worth.
Trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wind up trading and I trade it for my
Starbucks and he gives me a nice one or
[SPEAKER_03]: so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that thing for a little while now
and now someone wants to maybe trade that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting is where I'm getting the
concept from is it's really, it's about
[SPEAKER_03]: the value is what you see the value at and
it's not really the value of what... It's
the individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the individual who sets the value on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That value could be at any price and that
value could go up as that coin is traded
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gains value by what it represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy people put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what... I was asked what
backs the currency and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, Marcel, are you going to back the
currency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just buy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I buy any piece from you with your
currency?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is that it's backed by the
community and the platform that I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to build or that I am building,
excuse me, the platform that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: building is designed to enlist the
community in the actual creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the show comes to town, it's a cross
between a glass blowing workshop and a
[SPEAKER_00]: music festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly small, intense environment
and people are exposed to information
[SPEAKER_00]: about currency and exactly how directly
using a currency is holding us prisoner as
[SPEAKER_00]: a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the attendance of that, everyone is
enlisted to actually stamp the coins and
[SPEAKER_00]: create the currency itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is there's pre-support where
people are knowing about the currency and
[SPEAKER_00]: they advance the materials and supplies
and fundage that's necessary for the show
[SPEAKER_00]: to be created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each creation, as these were created at
Project 33 in 2013 by a community of
[SPEAKER_00]: artists who came together freely,
as these were created, they're now going
[SPEAKER_00]: to support the creation of the project
directly but when people come,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's not make a milli,
they could just be part of a line of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are working to move glass rods
down, get them hot and smash them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: press and make pressed coins for lower
denominations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about these as thousand
dollar coins because they're marked with
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 start to bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 100 on it, 10 to one,
whatever, but we could make a milli with a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller denomination but for a very small
denomination, we have glass pressed coins
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also have penny pinchers where you
could actually use a vending machine type
[SPEAKER_00]: format and be able to put in US currency
and a penny and turn the crank and it
[SPEAKER_00]: presses out the lowest denomination.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a participant in this show,
no matter what your skill level,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what your ability to participate
in the art making process is, we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: option and you can be part of a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the team and you come to this
event, you've invested your time and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've offered your time to be exposed to
these ideas and when the coins are done at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the event, all of the excess is
distributed back to the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: attending so we have our plans of what we
as an event need in order to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: different shows and make it to the next
shows and the planned expansion but the
[SPEAKER_00]: excesses beyond that are designed to be
distributed so that everyone who comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: these shows then has the icons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Starbucks where they can take it
back to their community and share the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very cool idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many different ways it can be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even as you're explaining it to me,
my own mind is just coming up with these
[SPEAKER_05]: other concepts and ideas based on this
idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, that's what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You picture people often, a more
simplified version, because this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: talk full on, the information knowledge
drops with the permaculture and all that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that goes beyond just glass collecting and
trading.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to bring a concept like this back to
glass collecting and trading, for a blower
[SPEAKER_05]: who might be low on funds and unable to
acquire the right amount of glass rods or
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen or whatever, a blower that people
stand behind and believe in, they could
[SPEAKER_05]: put out their own unique coin and say this
is a collector's edition, we're selling
[SPEAKER_05]: them for $200 a piece or whatever,
and if you want a piece later on in life,
[SPEAKER_05]: for me, I will actually take that as $300.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only me, the glass blower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only I will give you $300 off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a trade currency, it's like a
personal currency of just, you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: collector, you're supporting the integrity
of an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes an artist who is having
integrity may not be supported fully
[SPEAKER_00]: because of some of the choices that come
along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, high integrity, low profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each event is going to create its own
unique coin, only so what we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about is just say, at the last blowering
competition, that actually turns into,
[SPEAKER_03]: that weekend turns into creating a bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that whole weekend, the glassblowers
all get together and they create so many,
[SPEAKER_03]: they create these coins and they create a
bank over the weekend where then over the
[SPEAKER_03]: weekend you have the seminars and it's the
whole event and people are learning and
[SPEAKER_03]: they can use these to learn more things
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can have the different,
there's so many ways the system is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually generate money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's modeled off of the system
that's holding us down so effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to generate resource in all
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to encourage people to share
their resources with each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as a community- Personal skills and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and so he's talking about the
glassblower that might not have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, I was thinking of the
permaculture farm that needs a tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things to back up these
ideas to create, because we're a community
[SPEAKER_00]: of- Bringing the community together
instead of trading on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trading us in resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improving the spaces that we are at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's it worth to the person that has the
coin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that might be for me a great
trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with this, I'm going to be able to
trade the next couple bales of dirt that I
[SPEAKER_03]: need to grow my next crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to do this, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just with that one coin, but it just
keeps filtering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not money, we're trading back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understand, we're taking money all the
time out of it and it becomes part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: back to who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, part of the assertion with the money
and the reason to go after the currency is
[SPEAKER_00]: the act of interest is constantly watering
the money supply down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time somebody like you or I put
our actual human effort and time into
[SPEAKER_00]: creating value, and then put the money in
the bank to create security for ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: or our families, that starts generating
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual generation of interest,
no matter who it's paid for, waters down
[SPEAKER_00]: the effectiveness of the labor that's been
done by every single human being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet that generated real value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the scam works, just because
of inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know this on an intellectual
level, but the illusion of what you said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, the true cost of objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost to our ability to survive on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's the air conditioners they
were running off of Fukushima in Japan
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, changed people's lives
and made them much more comfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now our ocean is destroyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all tie in together though,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a society today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, um, it's about giving back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about helping one another and
educating and trading and really finding
[SPEAKER_03]: the genuine people that you deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this brings not only the glass boys,
but the community together as in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community is, is, is I don't
believe that I live with so much and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: all part of the community, but this,
this is just creating another economy for
[SPEAKER_03]: the next generation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's an economy that draws
people together as opposed to an economy
[SPEAKER_02]: and a currency base that keeps people
apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the current one, the current one
creates divisions inherently within itself
[SPEAKER_02]: for the people because of the amount of
lack of, I should say, diversification
[SPEAKER_02]: within the individual wealth levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on our way to, to Spain for the next
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome trip and I had to
go get some currency exchange and that
[SPEAKER_03]: currency is worth a lot more than our
currency where this currency value is set
[SPEAKER_03]: on what the individual, what we have to
work with one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't leave you feeling very good,
does it?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you trade a currency and it's just
like, yeah, you get like this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this, you, you get rewarded with
the currency that you're trading.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what that's when I'm kind of,
you know, when people say to you,
[SPEAKER_05]: are you going to back this currency?
[SPEAKER_05]: Your answer every time should be who you
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's going to make it real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there it is right in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the sound bite right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're the one who's an individual
make back this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why money's unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need banks to tell us to back
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is brand new.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need our individual skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't understand what that
means, understand that money didn't say
[SPEAKER_05]: build the deck that we're sitting on right
now, but people built this deck for the
[SPEAKER_05]: illusion of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was their labor that built this
deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the illusion of money that demanded
that they require payment of monetary
[SPEAKER_02]: terms such as the American greenback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before money people just traded in Nepal,
half the country, 12 million people still
[SPEAKER_05]: just trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have trade books.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you help me with my fence,
I come over and I help you and dig your
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I help you dig your well, you might
help me and move some rocks out of my yard
[SPEAKER_05]: to another area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they, they live in a jungle and 12
and a half million people in Nepal
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely don't use currency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean at the same time, it's a
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're only poor when they try to use
currency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise the poorest people in the world
are the happiest people that I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's not about money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about their surroundings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they once again trade and we give back
and it's about helping one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great concept too, because right
now so many people are putting so much
[SPEAKER_05]: money into glass pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great concept that puts money into
glass, borrow and the community,
[SPEAKER_05]: but expands it and allows it to like he
was saying earlier, like buy a tractor for
[SPEAKER_05]: a permaculture farmer, you know,
or even something next level like helping
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, someone with, with a pro
medication or something that buying these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this, the synergy that we're having
right here, you guys are talking about all
[SPEAKER_00]: these ideas that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what the goal of the project
is, is to bring people together,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the people themselves do the labor to
create a body of currency and distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: that currency and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: With linking up and networking from being
at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys are both at the event,
the permaculture guy and the glassblower
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and they've got, it's not about the
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when people come and realize what a
sham the currency is and then turn to the
[SPEAKER_00]: person next to them and say, what do you
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the aha moment for this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where when we make that happen,
we're executing the vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there's a, there's a quote that just,
well, I was just saying, if you come to an
[SPEAKER_03]: educational seminar with bubble mat and
John V and at the end of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you use a coin to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the seminar,
you actually get two, two coins when you
[SPEAKER_03]: leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take, you can go to the next
level seminar and bring somebody with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a propagation of knowledge
that multiplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're it's, it's, and you'll find
more value in that because of what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: giving and receiving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it's not worth money,
but it's still worth the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_03]: education that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in reality, it's worth a lot more than
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have, I got, I got,
I got a coin from our educational weekend
[SPEAKER_03]: seminar with what, with learning how to
make whatever, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a bubble man edition or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's about, yeah, I'm really,
that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like on a full festival level,
you'd have all your different activities
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd have people that if you sat and
you did the course, then you would receive
[SPEAKER_00]: gratitude icons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the thanks from the
people with the knowledge for taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to learn from them and propagate the
knowledge further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not for some reason lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you go around this event,
you'd be getting two coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could keep one or you could bring a
buddy to your, each of your next,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, next levels of, of education is
one way that we had visualized it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just another concept because that's
what I really like doing is the
[SPEAKER_03]: educational part of what my concept is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like what we're moving into
naturally in this last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'll just, you and I in particular in
the education thing, like all of our
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube videos are basically educational
videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: People need to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what people like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this, this is also an educational
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this, this is an educational
experience where people are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together and part of the entertainment,
you know, is we have a music stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we really, we have a glass blowing
stage, you know, and so the local glass
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers are going to come together and
make work at each of these events where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's making the currency and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, that's going to be the
stars pulling everything, not just making
[SPEAKER_00]: the currency, but even like a side project
that we can market with the currency as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of a way to get people to exchange,
to use it to people will want to collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only will people want to collect the
collector edition currency, but they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: also want to support the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to support the project,
you have to collect the currency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it, to get the things that are made
from the project, you have to give up the
[SPEAKER_03]: currency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like giving back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to, I liked it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, it's kind of like,
well, if you want to do it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing is to the,
to the organization to project 33,
[SPEAKER_00]: the coins are always going to be face
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there may be an exchange
that happens with the, what they're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we deal with them, as people buy
into currency, so say it comes down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road and there's a really beautiful
project 33 piece that's been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know, 2000 Starbucks
is what the cost is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to figure out how to get 2000
Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way might be to exchange directly
with project 33, which you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would be paying face value,
but you don't know which coins you would
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily get back because we're,
it would be like kind of a function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank, like we would be constantly taking
coins back in order to give pieces back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then sending coins out in order to
show gratitude for the raw supply and cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of moving the expedition.
[SPEAKER_02]: What artists are there, it'll be a
different coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you could give in, say like
hypothetically speaking, like two Brandon
[SPEAKER_02]: Martin led coins and get back at the end
of the day, when you trade back in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could get back a Jason Lee led coin or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the market evolves,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, I'm trying to express the thought.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea basically is as the coins are
collected and people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is now part of my collection and I'm
not going to negotiate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be what backs the
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what the government gets
when we all put our money in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden they have all this money
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when these are collected and we're
forced to just keep printing more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more of them and create more of them
and they keep getting collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows the war chest for our idea to
propagate itself, to get bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker and more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really what's backing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes back to what's backing the
coin, you're backing the coin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and how you back that coin is by
collecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when you collect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this organization, which is,
it's not an organization, it's an artistic
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crystal being that's being birthed
that, you know, it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I'm eternally grateful
for being able to play a part in bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, it's... I would just add the
filter for people that aren't quite at a
[SPEAKER_05]: point in their life where they're really
ready to hear what Marcel just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by hear I mean kind of understand it
and be inspired by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually just like well ahead of his
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's ahead of his time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known this dude for like almost 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just always been ahead of his
time, which is awesome because his time
[SPEAKER_05]: has been catching up to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not like a hundred years ahead of his
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just, he's about five to 10 years
ahead of some of what you who are
[SPEAKER_05]: listening right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean that in an insultive way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just mean like truly the dude is like,
even I'm listening to him and earlier Flav
[SPEAKER_05]: was like, what do you think of this idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what do you think of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, well, dude,
it's Marcel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like right now I think that he's
struggling to voice into language what he
[SPEAKER_05]: really sees and he's just able to squirt
out little bits to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Flav was like, oh yeah,
yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was, that's the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's, I have faith in Marcel that if
he has a project in mind that it'll only
[SPEAKER_05]: have done good in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never hear, oh yeah, that, that thing
flopped large for Marcel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a huge flop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm saying as bubble man to you
guys who are listening, this would be
[SPEAKER_05]: something that if you hear more about or
you have a way of hearing more about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you should definitely look into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be, it's going to be
something you're going to hear more about
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's just going to be up to you
whether you want to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no different than a Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no different conceptually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that from the heart
and the soul, you want to back a little
[SPEAKER_02]: better from the glass community and you
can hold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty, pretty beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think, I think it's a,
it's, it's just something real and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: made by real people and you're for real
intent and real knowledge and being able
[SPEAKER_03]: to, actually, I mean, it's, it's a pretty
cool concept is when you, when you,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you really start thinking about it
and actually talking with yourself for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last, basically hour, but really getting
in depth about it and stuff like that is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the whole concept behind this is,
is about connecting communities and
[SPEAKER_03]: connecting people and being able to really
join us as a whole and understanding that
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't about money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's really, it's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really, it's about trying to
like learn to trust the integrity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people around you to do the right thing
and pass the resources on that they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get down the road, to do whatever it is
that they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how about explaining to people who
are, who are watching that really have
[SPEAKER_05]: little concept of the glass world and the
glass community and the collect,
[SPEAKER_05]: the collective value and whatnot,
but the simple explanation of like what
[SPEAKER_05]: these coins are and how they're made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give that to us just a second?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a quick couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cause I mean, I know what a
millie is and everyone here does,
[SPEAKER_05]: but some people watching might be like,
what are those that he's holding?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a millefiori.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cane that has a picture in the
cross section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's built up from the center outward
to have a picture in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just stack canes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of strike them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's pulled from a large piece
down to a smaller piece and it's sliced
[SPEAKER_00]: and polished.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like pull the cane into a tube
almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, you just slice it into
pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of these were part of one long
cane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why we have all different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the cane was the kind of
part of the cane gets smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you were pulling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of like pull something apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get the smaller ones and you get a lot
of them are the same size, but you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: the different dimensions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, uh, well, you know, it's,
it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, it's, uh,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's rewarding when you,
when, when you get something, it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: like a doubler that you get from the bank
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, it's gotten more, it's more real
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And even more so for the people that were
actually like, if you could actually be a
[SPEAKER_05]: part of creating.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what, that's where it
becomes more real to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you become a part, we're going
to become a part of creating one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see it already for educational
seminars.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our cross country educational seminars
will be brought to you by.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, but I mean, it's, it's a,
it's a way of, it really, um, and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: more festivals and the more that you have
bringing together, the more people are
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting because it's creating more people
bringing your bond together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one starts and then the talk,
it's going, you have to do a second and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the funding comes for the third
because we keep creating the bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time you have a festival,
you create a bank of people come to create
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those people, and, and you'll see
it over time growing that everyone's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to want to come to the festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now all of a sudden we're going to go,
okay, we only got enough people to create
[SPEAKER_03]: the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to stop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got too many people involved in this
bank and that's going to be where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be part of the challenge of
maintaining like full accessibility of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how do we make this a throughput
process where like as many people are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to like participate as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause currently it's exactly the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make as few people
participate as possible in the creation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the system where we track everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we need as many people as
possible to create, uh, to participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: that system so that the focus becomes
focused and we can focus on fixing things
[SPEAKER_00]: like the planet and, you know,
just basic, basic survivability things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there could be any one,
any one thing that makes me really upset,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the wealth gap between the very rich
and the very poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't we just like close it like 50%
from each direction and call it a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that would be, you know, a huge
improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there would still be huge amounts of
wealth on that original side anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like you're going to be
12.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem a little, it does seem
ridiculous to have $20 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you got 99% of everything,
would you give up like 30% of 99 and be
[SPEAKER_02]: left with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, maybe it's just like no
one needs a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if we just had millionaires that the
wealth would be more evenly distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think that's one of the,
you know, one of the things that's most
[SPEAKER_00]: important with a gift economy is that you
don't hoard resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a big, uh, come up and you
make a hundred thousand dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the gift economy, you would
immediately redistribute that wealth and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you would see benefit in your
life would be that, okay, I just had a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred grand handed to me on a silver
plate and I gave 30 grand to three friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all three went out and started
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think that your life is going to
get a little bit more fun when your three
[SPEAKER_00]: best friends now also have boats and
you're on the lake having a great time and
[SPEAKER_00]: you all have the ability to like interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so by, rather than saving that
you've, you've tripled your security
[SPEAKER_00]: because now if something happens to you,
you have two friends who have got your
[SPEAKER_00]: back 110% as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost better than putting that
money in the bank, which in the bank it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being used against all of us, loaned out
to people so they can pay three times the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of the negotiation they made for
their piece of real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have to go through banks to buy
real estate and we all have like family
[SPEAKER_00]: and friends and resources that are in the
banks and that's why the banks have the
[SPEAKER_00]: money to loan us so we can give them all
that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so the concept of keeping energy
in play is really, is really core to the
[SPEAKER_00]: gift economy and how it can work to where
people just don't have to work as hard
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're making a more efficient
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating a real economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think everyone's really like us,
but you know what, we already know that
[SPEAKER_03]: right now so it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like times are ripe for
change, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We, that's the whole thing, the change and
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this beautiful planet's making
change and people make change and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: another change and this is a boat,
a boat working.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concept is just so crazy because it's
so organic and how it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another thing about this,
it's organic and it's the people behind it
[SPEAKER_03]: that create it and it's us that make it
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I believe as easily as a handful
of people could ruin the whole planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can all simply wake up and change it
and make that impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need for apocalyptic
inventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as people making simple
choices all at once, taking a conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: leap into the new paradigm, just believing
in each other 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a conscious shift building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just like gone through a week of
not having that totally centered in my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and it was not the most beneficial
to my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not easy to be happy all the
time and to be positive and support
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself in the right ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always make yourself available for
others in positive manners to help them
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't it true that hash makes all that
so much a little bit easier?
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said it's not the full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gone up here for the hash for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially setting hash rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, do you want to hear something weird?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like freaky trippy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to live back then two doors over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two doors over.
[SPEAKER_05]: From where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The house that you used to come to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that box that filled the whole lot
is the house between now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the one right on the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember I lived in Lyons Bay for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a deck out on the hot tub.
[SPEAKER_05]: You came a few times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I did come up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pedro, D-Rex, Zach, Slinger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slinger lived in that house for a while
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two doors over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see why you've rooted in here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no take-out food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is also great.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can go and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it'll take the wife out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope we gave you a good download
today on such a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitting the Gmail, listening to Marcel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The start book is a start.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll only grow from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the coin, a starship in every
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the backing slogan of the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I find myself wondering, I come back
to the basic slogan, which is a starship
[SPEAKER_05]: in every garage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty insane that you can make
pictures like that and then words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starship in every garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink.
Wink.
Wink.
Wink.
Wink.
