[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver, British Columbia, right in the
city centre.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be there with John B.
[SPEAKER_01]: from Medtator and we're going to be
selling a whack load of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be carrying some skillet
tools and some oil slick, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different cool stackables and the micro
stacks and the slick balls and the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: slicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got bubble bags of multiple
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be bringing one gallon
lights, eight bags for 90 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be bringing the standards,
five gallons in one gallon bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in eight bag kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have just a bunch of cool products
to check out, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mothership and the D-nail are going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be doing a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little dabby doodles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of that five year plus master
crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured while we were showing,
I might as well do a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we see you tomorrow.
