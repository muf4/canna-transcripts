[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty relaxed here out on the house
sound, chilling on the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to give you guys a mention
that we're going to be doing Hash Church
[SPEAKER_00]: again this Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be a good idea to let
everyone know in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping on getting Dr. David Allen to
come in and chat with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with him a little bit today about
some very interesting things that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: leave to him if he comes in on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've invited Horatio back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've invited Johnny B and D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually invited Tony Versura
from United Cannabis and from River Rock
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't said whether he's going to be
able to do it, but he's definitely going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make an attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured while I had you guys here on
the boat, we would smoke a pure hash joint
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know it's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back lit by the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figured I'd share a beautiful hash
joint with the Bubble Man's World
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit different than lighting your
everyday joint because you've got a big
[SPEAKER_00]: hollow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're sucking in that heat off the
cherry, it's substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to put your teeth in the
way because the air that you suck through
[SPEAKER_00]: the tube is extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to light it three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a grandma hash right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll probably burn for 15 to 20
minutes judging by my last video where I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked a pure hash joint right down to the
roach and then finished that off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I have a couple of friends with
me on the boat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One holding the phone and one sitting just
out of the camera angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be enjoying it with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, hash church on Sunday coming
up in four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see you in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Google+.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check the YouTube account at the
bottom of the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says live events coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll show you that event when you
click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open up the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you a countdown if it has not
yet begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that number gets down to zero,
I'll push on air and we'll be broadcasting
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come hang out with us at hash church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish this beautiful hash
joint with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
