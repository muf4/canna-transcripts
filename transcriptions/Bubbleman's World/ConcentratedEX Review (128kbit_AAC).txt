[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and today I'm going to be reviewing a
[SPEAKER_00]: really really great guy's product You
probably know him from Instagram if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: checked him out at Concentrated X so
that's the word Concentrated With an E X
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a wonderful variety of products
from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy is super on point for his ability
to choose and find cultivars that have
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely beautiful expressions of their
terpene profiles and their cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been sending me stuff for a little
while here and he's got himself into some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a beautiful cut of strawberry
banana and so he has sent me a little 120
[SPEAKER_00]: micron bubble hash from the strawberry
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has sent me a little bit of the golden
berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 120 microns as well and then we
have three different rosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the cookies and cream dry sift
rosin with kosher Kush dry sift rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is head stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's written on the thing and he gave me
another one cookies and cream kosher Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift rosin head stash and those are
both rosins and then of course here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash strawberry banana rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these strawberry bananas just have the
most incredible flavor profile on them
[SPEAKER_00]: when you pull them out people their
eyebrows go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you exhale a hit of this people are
around you asking what is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great job on that and then of course he
actually sent me some bud as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some cookies and cream here on
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the cultivars came from
exotic genetics right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the darkness today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get myself lit up as beautiful
as possible but for whatever reason today
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the backlight on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys prefer the view over a
bright bubble man but I don't think it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: stop us from doing a really nice review
video on these products and of course I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to photograph up close macro each
one of these products so you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see what it looks like close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got ourselves a little bit high here
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get myself up to about five ninety five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what to start with what to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I say we start with the bud because
that's what everyone starts with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little vaporizer I'm going
to grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vaporizer I grabbed is of course
the grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from Vape Fiend in London and
let's get this happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of an empty bowl to be
cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just never a big deal with the
grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it that last little blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's cleared out nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you want that nice taste in
your rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly lovely herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that we maximize
it and don't have any leftover remnants in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that don't know about
the grasshopper vaporizer this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not look like a vaporizer like most
of these pen units.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really looks like a pen as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit dark as I've mentioned before
but you can still see this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great little grasshopper unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put a little bud in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with the concentrated
X review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really all you have to do is hear me
in a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have to see everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will see is very clear very
bright macro photographs of these
[SPEAKER_00]: materials as you can see right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bud that I'm about to pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful calyx formation on this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always just grown to darn near
perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just stuff it into the into the
vaporizer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually hit herb this way I will
admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a concentrate guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably take this herb and squish
it in the Sasquatch press.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought for the review that it would
be cool if I started with a little vape
[SPEAKER_00]: hit out of this particular cookies and
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the first time I've hit the
cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course Exotic Genetics gifted me some
99.9% dry sift from Cuban a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ago or so when we were in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some pretty epic photos of it if
you don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check them out on my Instagram as
well as Cubans Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this unit is real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push the button once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a line of red lights in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 10 little dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within about three to five seconds
you'll see that it will reach temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dots will turn blue as it just
turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I usually give it a little bit of
time and gently pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really really nice flavor on that cookies
and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came in really nice and light and
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good moisture content on this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means does it break into powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you break it it actually squishes and
it's more marshmallowy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this on maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice flavor profile on both of
those rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you guys are catching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly light vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you stuffed it more and turned
up the temperature you can get a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know for me for vaporizers the rip
that I want I'm going to get out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership in the Sapphire D-Nail dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more just like nice nice tasting
nice nice flavor you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you a little bit of a buzz too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also my wake and bake today so I
can tell you from three light rips on the
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer it is lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job as always concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrated evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand water and trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally sourced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never sprayed with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because quality matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons I love to
support concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice packaging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well turn that guy off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we need to get that dabber out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out she comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real nice tight little screen
laser perforated on the inside and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: also has a little laser screen perforated
on the inside of the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is classic because the last thing I
want to taste is remnants of pot coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through in my mouthpiece when I'm hitting
a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real deal breaker for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasshopper vaporizer along with some
cookies and cream via exotic genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: through concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I managed to clean the D-Nail all up
here for the next little part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie I'm looking pretty
forward to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh what should we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we go into the rosin next because I
find yeah I find you know for me the best
[SPEAKER_00]: the best the best is the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two of them right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start with why don't we
start with the headstache cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: cream kosher kush dry sift rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always beautiful packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell it right away with concentrated
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take long before you open the
package and it's on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real lovely looking shattery stuff
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little bubbles really show that it's
it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I can flip it off of the
parchment and it's a fairly stable product
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us have a little dab of it and
we'll talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open up concentrated X's products and
there's just no contaminant whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know you're going to be paying top
quality for a product like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do this dry sift rosin from
concentrated X via the cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_00]: and the kosher kush on a freshly clean
sapphire dish that I can't tell you it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just white as white can be really lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do some macro rips of the bubble hash
at least as for me rosin isn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: something very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oil watching oil melt into a
liquid is kind of a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see a solidified chunk of
hash melting into and bubbling into a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid there's something really quite
visually stunning about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will make sure that we sell we share
those with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your dabber if you got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grabbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three two one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so light flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting it to really pound me but
the kosher kush seems to really have
[SPEAKER_00]: gassed up that cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_00]: very very little product left on the halo
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to quickly grab a q-tip and
grab a nice handful here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really really really nice rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very very little leftover on that rosin
which is great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely what I like to see anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see a ton of wax
membranes or whatever it is that's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the rosin you know boils away to
almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me while I catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran down three flights of stairs to grab
the q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put the cookies and cream and the
kosher sift dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely head stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll put them over there along or
actually we'll put them up here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom and boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strawberry banana rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strong cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kimball's kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never found them to be overwhelmingly
strong as much as I love the flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: the purity and the beautifulness of the
resin which is often the case I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit with a lot of different cultivars
particularly ones that taste incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calio being a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: However with this strawberry banana it
really does have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh this one's butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does have this incredibly high
terpene profile that I'm telling you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you hit it when you taste it when you have
that flavor profile pass across your
[SPEAKER_00]: palate it's unmistakable and you will
absolutely remember it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a nice little nice
little dab of this buttered up turp rich
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry banana rosin and it is bubble
hash rosin for those of you wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm not sure what the THC percentage
is in this strawberry banana but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely high with a very unique terpene
profile as well that modulates it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful sort of way that you actually
very much feel instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again very little residue in the in
the dish maybe a little bit more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry banana than there was on the
dry sifted material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always nice to make sure you clean both
sides of the dish if you get it dirty on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside it's easy to wipe up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom boom boom get it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to keep these things
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cleaner we can the less we have to
clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right and what I mean clean them I
mean like the long-term plugging it into
[SPEAKER_00]: my whip into a different D-nail that set
at a much warmer temperature because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know someone's going to say how do you
clean your dish bubble man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How I clean my dish is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unplug my whip I plug it into my D-nail
it sits on top of my dabinator and my
[SPEAKER_00]: D-nail sits around a thousand to eleven
hundred degrees Fahrenheit and it turns
[SPEAKER_00]: this orange hot the the flat coil and it
basically takes about 10 to 15 minutes if
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually are q-tipping it and keeping
it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it get crusty and someone's
hitting some nasty stuff at too hot of a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and they're not q-tipping it
and it's blacking out that'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: take about an hour an hour and a half at
that temperature to just clean right out
[SPEAKER_00]: you can usually walk over and just blow
into it and it'll just clear this light
[SPEAKER_00]: light-colored dust that seems to dissipate
to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's of course my stash that I'm puffing
on it it may be different for you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: stash but I'm sharing my own experience
with you here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us move on we've hit the two rosins
the dry sift rosin and the bubble hash
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin we've hit the bud which was very
light but tasty kind of set the motion
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a little sip of orange juice
before breakfast if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had the eggs we've had some toast
let's get into the meat and potatoes of
[SPEAKER_00]: this breakfast just kind of funny to say
as a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go for GB as I did just hit the
strawberry banana and he's got a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little method that he he seals these jars
with a sticker that goes all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: around so you definitely want to use
something sharp that you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scrape away at the sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always the easiest to open I'll have
to admit but I guess in that sense they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not opening by accident which is always a
good thing when it comes to stash and
[SPEAKER_00]: containers and it also really lets you
know like if you open this to look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: you have absolutely breached the label
there's no trying to trick anyone into
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that you have not opened this
when it's been opened so I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go usually just pull the little
remnants of material sticker that are
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging just so they don't end up in the
hash and yeah go give concentrated X if
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't already a follow on Instagram
good guy posting beautiful photos and good
[SPEAKER_00]: information of his grow and his compost
teas etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you look at that I'd love to show
you guys this but it's all on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all on the side it's never fun when
it does that especially because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it has fallen this is one of the reasons I
personally am not a huge fan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper inside a plastic little
case like this I find that I might have
[SPEAKER_00]: just preferred the hash to be right into
just right into the case but we've saved
[SPEAKER_00]: the day nothing too brutal here happening
I managed to get a nice little piece out
[SPEAKER_00]: of here it looks like it's kind of buttery
so I'm gonna have to not be able to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: it up the way I normally do but get a
little heat happening on our dabber a
[SPEAKER_00]: little heat can go a long way there we go
picked up a nice chunk not gonna lie my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth watered a tiny little bit as I
picked that up and so this is very very
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable stuff that you do not want to if
you're leaving it open you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be leaving it in any situation where it
could be bumped and knocked off the table
[SPEAKER_00]: because let me tell you grown men will
weep grown men will weep all right let's
[SPEAKER_00]: hit this concentrated X 120 micron bubble
hash strawberry banana no golden berry
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right all right it's a new flavor I
haven't hit this one yet let's give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: shot smells beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting yeah that's a different
profile completely has a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: berry taste going in but it's it changes
into a few Lee kind of Kush but then at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end when you exhale it's got this
soapy sort of thing going on yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I taste that berry on the inhale kind of
tasted on your lips a little bit but a
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting middle part to this
that's a few Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely melted in a very unique way
left a quite a bit more residual on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen obviously being bubble hash didn't
melt right away did not melt right away it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sat there for a second made me
think for about a half a second that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I unplugged the D nail and that it wasn't
on anymore and then I saw it sort of slump
[SPEAKER_00]: and start melting usually a sign of a
product that is a little less melty than
[SPEAKER_00]: more melty but I'll tell you the flavor
and the obviously kind of hard to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: the high being behind two rips of rosin
dry sift and bubble hash and vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: rips of kind herb obviously I can describe
the effects that I feel after I hit it on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of what I've already hit but I'm not
giving an accurate description of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of these particular cultivars
concentrates at through the wake and bake
[SPEAKER_00]: as you if you know if you did that it's
going to be substantially different than
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting them all in a row the way I do but
I'm a fiend so and perhaps I will add wake
[SPEAKER_00]: and bake just not on this particular video
but you might just see small little wake
[SPEAKER_00]: and bake videos hit the YouTube I'll try
to do a wake and bake with each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these in the next couple of weeks and in
the meantime I guess we are down to our
[SPEAKER_00]: last cultivar the strawberry banana bubble
hash 120 this is amazing I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked like a couple of grams of it it was
just spectacular took some amazing macro
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs of it which I've already
shared on Instagram and I will share on
[SPEAKER_00]: this video and just impressive you know
really really nice nice nice product a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy and time goes into controlling
the variables to come up with a product
[SPEAKER_00]: like this so my hats are off to you
concentrated X it's it's a lot of work you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's not just about watering some
plants there's a lot of work that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into finding these cultivars and then
growing them properly etc etc it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: easy as you can see because otherwise
everyone would have these products and
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly they don't all right so actually
let's use this one seeing as that one's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hot these carb caps get hot I'll
tell you doesn't take long sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: halo dish at 580 degrees before it gets
fairly hot all right here we go strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: banana straw Nana so it's got the little
top on it like that oh she's on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: as well but that's okay ah that is just
such fire definitely showing this to you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys right now look at that oh my goodness
very nice very nice see if we can't scoop
[SPEAKER_00]: a little off the lid here this is sticky
sticky icky very nice very nice it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: marshmallow it's got the perfect perfect
you know sticky sticky icky you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: could put a poster up with this stuff
which I used to always talk about you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what people would ask me or you know is
this good is this good is my bubble good
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of them were doing it via the
computer and so I would ask them can you
[SPEAKER_00]: put a poster up with it if you take four
small pieces can you put a poster on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall that is great hash this is poster
hash so to you concentrated X for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: rip of this small little review I do
appreciate all your kindness and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the access that you're offering
to people to be able to acquire this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful product so keep doing you and
here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: all right well it's officially a good
review man maybe even a great review
[SPEAKER_00]: because indeed as you guys can see the
whip somehow got unplugged a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and it did turn off the D nail I don't
even know what I hit that golden berry rip
[SPEAKER_00]: at I think I'm going to hit the golden
berry again here but for now I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry banana loaded up loaded it up
real nice and of course I should probably
[SPEAKER_00]: clean this halo dish that is smoking off
from the remnants of the hit that I hit at
[SPEAKER_00]: oh I don't know room temperature so I
thought that was funny usually I would
[SPEAKER_00]: edit stuff out like that but why I can
show you guys my failures as well as my
[SPEAKER_00]: successes and it's something to laugh
about anyway so I thought it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: funny I'm sure you were like what the fuck
anyway let's do this last rip from
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated X take two on the strawberry
banana 120 micron bubble hash from
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated X here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no that's the stuff and all that's my
favorite by far of everything from the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift rosin to the bud to the bubble hash
rosin the bubble hash hits just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess I am biased being bubble man and all
having coined the phrase bubble hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: having sold bubble bags for the last 18
years actually happy birthday to fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: Heddy's my company which turned 18 years
old back in 1999 we started that company
[SPEAKER_00]: three doors down from where I'm sitting
right now
[SPEAKER_00]: so very cool yeah we'll shout us out one
more time fresh Heddy's calm bubble bag
[SPEAKER_00]: calm if you yourself want to go out on a
limb and find yourself as many of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to make some hash you can check
out a variety of hashish making tools over
[SPEAKER_00]: at fresh Heddy's calm as well as the
bubble bag calm from dry sifts mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: screen separation we have kits to screens
and four screens multiple sizes bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: bags as well on the website there in all
one gallon five gallon and 20 gallon sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: four bags to eight bags and even available
in lights standards and originals all
