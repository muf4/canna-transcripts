[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go, we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we've got our resin here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our 25 micron is still sitting out in the
bag, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out in the cold weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the towel underneath,
and we've got the towel over top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our strainers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little one and a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a variety of spoons that we'll be able
to use inside the strainer to allow it to
[SPEAKER_01]: fall properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got, this is helpful,
cardboard with all the numbers written on
[SPEAKER_01]: it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: 160, 120, 90, 73, and 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some other cardboards here as
well with more numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty important, even though you
might think you know what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: to mark down the resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying to Ron, earlier when you
put the 220 right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had all of these, you know,
sure an expert hash maker should pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much be able, I can tell you which one the
45 is, the 73 and the 90 would be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to hone in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be impossible, but let's just
be organized and do this the proper way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to do straining today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do microplaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microplaning is a process where I freeze
these after removing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, either letting it wick just like
this, freeze them, and then microplane
[SPEAKER_01]: them over the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do stainless strainer
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to just clean this out a
tiny bit because it's still dirty from the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time I used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving it a little whack like that will
literally clean 95% of the resin out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like the strainers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is pretty high quality resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have to know with straining
what quality of the resin you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with an extremely high
quality resin and you press down really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard, it's bonded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to push it through a
strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stuff in the freezer and
microplane it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to be pretty gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these patties here have now
dried out a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much for straining, I don't want
them to be much drier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the quality of this watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the quality of Subcool and his
strains, the TGA crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys produce full-melt genetics
certified by me, the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our strains here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of lift it up a little bit for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: 220, 190, 160, 120, 90, 73, and 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to take these for
starters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the 220, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean literally, I'll just put it up
here in the corner of the 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't push that through the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that on the strainer
contaminating my final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor do I want the 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll both be cooked into metal bowls,
most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, those can just sit right there on top
of the screen or on top of the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first one I'll actually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suggest when you do this that you
use a separate strainer for your lower
[SPEAKER_01]: grades as opposed to your higher grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, turn that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our 160 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Place it in our stainless strainer and
literally just grind it through,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not grinding it harsh,
but just nice and gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it just falls as powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get Ron to do a few of these
later and I'll actually film it closer so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see what I'm talking about of
allowing it to spread thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as you get to the end,
when you think that you just have all this
[SPEAKER_01]: hash stuck in your strainer, you just come
over to the other side and kind of give it
[SPEAKER_01]: a little shave and give it a little whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything comes off of your strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's our 160 done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our 220 and our 190 are sitting there
undone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take this strainer and this
spoon and put it over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has a lower quality resin and
because we want to be obsessive about
[SPEAKER_01]: this, let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew this cannabis for three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made variables of choosing phenotypes,
growing it under extreme conditions from
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling everything indoors to trying
to control bugs and powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in a greenhouse and you need
to add extra light because it's not sunny
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many variables that happen
along the lines and then you get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where you trim it and that's a
variable and how you maintain the trim and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you do with the trim and taking the
trim and finally washing it, not leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the water too long, doing all the
steps properly, getting to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This to me, in my opinion, is the only
thing that the water hash maker is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice mixing is popcorn and anyone can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's water and ice is doing the whole job
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, please don't take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower has grown great resin for you,
so please don't take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can take credit for is doing this
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this process properly is extremely
important and you'll be rewarded when you
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This 120 that we have is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to put it on the 120 and
the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very big piece of 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get that right into the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just put it all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little pile there and then we'll want
to move this out of the way a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might even do 120, 45 and 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so big I might do the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how it comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to spread thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to be getting all thick
and that's why you need a lot of space for
[SPEAKER_01]: the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do this wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clump it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hash needs surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it has the proper surface area,
the cardboard is going to do its job which
[SPEAKER_01]: is to wick the moisture out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why so many people turned off the
water hash because A, it was never dried
[SPEAKER_01]: properly or B, it was made incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things, little variables like not
leaving it in the water for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The card filled up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where I got caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was tapping the 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've now moved into the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful, nice fatty little
patty of just absolute blonde goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get that out on the 90
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strainer just works so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer this over the microplaning every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've watched the videos of the
microplaning and the grinding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do it a ton so I'm not pretending
to be the expert microplaner but I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely, definitely prefer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just clean and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a drop of resin on my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all the resin off the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you can see there is a little
bit of a build up there from someone not
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it all off if you require it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get over to the 70 micron here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 can go right into that same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we got for 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to save some room on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to do our 45 and still make
room for it because I'm not sure if you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys remember at the video there I
actually put the 120 on the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important that I mark that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are 120s now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well that I mark this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's a pen around but
I'll make sure that I do that because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want my resins all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, 45 I can guarantee tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always tell when it's the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very particular taste almost
regardless of the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always very oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it's really not as
difficult as some people might make it out
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got your cardboard resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: 160, 120, 90, 73 and 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: All beautifully spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is easy to move in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cardboard is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go now and put it in the room where
it's going to be drying and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to stay away from dust, debris,
hair, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably take one of the 100 micron
screens, the framed two by four foot
[SPEAKER_01]: frames I have and we'll flip it over top
of this so nothing can fall on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll catch up with you guys later when
this is all dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll end up getting macro photographs of
it and melt shots but for now I just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to give a huge thanks to Ron for having us
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a picture just to say this
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Marcus seemed at all fast at what he's
doing, he's on a plane in the next 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get him on icy roads and to
the airport and on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did that rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you guys later on Bubble Man's
World.
