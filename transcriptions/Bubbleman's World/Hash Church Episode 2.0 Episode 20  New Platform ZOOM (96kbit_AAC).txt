[SPEAKER_02]: This microphone live?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are all live, my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a second here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to set up YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a bit of a delay on YouTube,
but that's Otay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is your guardian angel?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela Medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's skip that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to say something because I
haven't yet, which is welcome to Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have written 3.0, but I'll be
honest, I wasn't ready to let go of 2.0
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we only did 19 2.0 episodes,
so I was like, it's still episode 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in episode 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the new platform, Zoom,
so I want to welcome all our OGs into the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp Guy, D420K, Johnny B, and Etienne are
all here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's your morning going?
[SPEAKER_02]: My morning's going okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they found us.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the people are in the room that we
want them to be, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just click the Hash Church
link up here and share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys understand,
but usually what I would do is I'd create
[SPEAKER_02]: a page on YouTube for the live show
because Google worked through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can create the show on YouTube,
but when I start the show on Zoom,
[SPEAKER_02]: it creates it in a totally different box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite the same as before, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Douglas K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gordon is going to come in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the gentleman throwing the CanX
conference in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to come talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really have anything in
particular to talk about today,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I just thought, let's just get a Hash
Church under our belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed these guys being able to come in
and do this with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I'll be honest, I really,
really missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we missed you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to talking to you guys and
shooting the shit once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about it with someone else
the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dialogue that we did at Hash Church
over the years really had a profound
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on the community, and it really
helped steer some of the things,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the dialogues and conversations
that we came up with from different
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and rosin vape carts and terpenes
and rosin itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those things were very,
very rare to see in the world of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: prior to our talking about it on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give Hash Church some props
for that and all of you guys for being a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure where everyone else is,
but hey, I got my crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't see us on the YouTube
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see us on the YouTube screen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me figure you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me figure you out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm all by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Darren.
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren just popped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but it's all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's a different screen,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that, Johnny B, where we can see
everyone?
It's kind of like out there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on YouTube, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, John, for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to be able to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably don't understand how I have
everything set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought when I set it up, and I wonder
if I set it up ... When you guys are up
[SPEAKER_02]: top, it's interesting that you don't show
up there, but no worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it in the gallery view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little pun there for your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Mike West is in the room as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is on mute, so we won't be able to hear
him right away, but jeez, he looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: he's just fishing or something on that
picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Johnny B, they're saying you need a
mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Superior Genetics loves the hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a gift from Ian Davidson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they were the OGs to do
compost, and then Jonathan from Forever
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowering Greenhouses came out with his
version, which was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have both of them, so thank you to
Ian Davidson for the super nice kick down
[SPEAKER_02]: on the compost hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how many people think it says
Compton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got four people wearing hats today,
although one of us who's wearing a hat is
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing a very different type of hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mike also has his kind of on the
side, so I'm just making like really
[SPEAKER_02]: obvious... I like the embark hat though,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Morning, morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to mute Johnny B because he's
talking to himself and making noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be Hash Church if Johnny B wasn't
making random sounds with his mic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start this day off right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I sent this out to everyone,
so I'm hoping that there's not people
[SPEAKER_02]: having problems with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited some other folks, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm liking the core group here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see it playing on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says waiting for Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's playing for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to watch it on YouTube before I
hopped on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if you want me to send you
the chat so you can see it, I don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not left there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's probably looking at the old
YouTube link, the thing that I was trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to explain earlier, that we don't come in
on that link.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a whole new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most everyone's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely playing live, says OG
Bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm listening to ... I'm watching the
chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some of the girls show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did invite Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited Wendy Turner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited Debbie Goldsberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited Callie Blackwell from the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully some of them show up as they
always have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I kind of did a hash church
and I invited Callie and Debbie,
[SPEAKER_02]: they both had showed up for the first time
and it didn't work if you guys remembered
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little bit of ... Hey,
Mark Shaldone.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, buddy?
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, what's happening, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: On what level of extremely stoked were you
at when you saw the David ... The Trucks
[SPEAKER_02]: and Trey ... Last night?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the Trucks ... No, then the Trey and
I can't even pronounce the name of that
[SPEAKER_02]: band.
[SPEAKER_16]: Derrick Trucks Tedeski Band, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, the other one, Kwong Bin or
whatever, because Trey played with them
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, last night they did Layla.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well last night they played with
Trucks Band and he did Layla and they did
[SPEAKER_02]: like... They did the Jimi Hendrix song,
Little Wing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, incredible weekend of music there.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was really, really good at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, to the Warfield shows back like
however many years ago when Phil and
[SPEAKER_02]: Friends with Trey and Mike.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it was epic.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think Derrick is just next
level.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's got the Dwayne Almond thing just down
like playing slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, watching Trey, watch ...
[SPEAKER_02]: Derrick was like, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and Susan Tedeski brings it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, she's like Bonnie Ray.
[SPEAKER_16]: She sings from her soul.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just such good music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of both you and Bishop when
I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you guys are happy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they had a loss earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_16]: O'Teal's brother, Kofi Burnbridge used to
play with them in the Tedeski Trucks Band.
[SPEAKER_16]: He unfortunately passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen him with the Tedeski
Trucks Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them all play together.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they crushed it last night.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, the one thing I was like,
oh my God, we watched it on Couch Tour and
[SPEAKER_16]: we're like, man, we're only like about
four hours away.
[SPEAKER_16]: We probably should have went to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it was just really, really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've seen both those bands play
independently, but to see them mixed up
[SPEAKER_16]: like that two nights in a row was just ...
It was on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much welcome to the young Padawan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colton Turner in the room, in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got asked actually, do you ever
invite patients into Hash Church?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Colton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try something.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all patients, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and he's not muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have to come in and restart a
browser.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all new to us, Colton,
so have patience with us, but we
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely want to get this working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually there's a ... I'm not sure where
you would go to find the preferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you can ... Oh, it is on the
bottom left.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the bottom left under mute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click over to the left there,
it gives you your microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can select your camera as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I had done earlier, Colton,
when I came in is it had chosen my
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone as a ... Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just like a commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, really good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that you and the fam went down to
the Seattle Hempfest and stopped at some
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool little American ... What were
you guys at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mount Rushmore or something?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we went to Mount Rushmore.
[SPEAKER_17]: We drove through the Badlands.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had to drive from Illinois to Seattle,
so we took two days to drive all the way
[SPEAKER_17]: there.
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were able to see Mount Rushmore.
[SPEAKER_17]: We drove through the Badlands,
but it was night, so we didn't really get
[SPEAKER_17]: to see it too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: We also got to go see the Geysers,
and we got to go see Old Faithful and saw
[SPEAKER_17]: it go off.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got to drive through Yellowstone Park.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even when we got to Seattle, Hempfest was
just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone there was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm never going to forget it.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was your first Hempfest?
[SPEAKER_17]: That was my first Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what it was like to be Colton
Turner at the Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You roll in with your middle America
family, super awesome crew, and what
[SPEAKER_02]: people are like, holy shit, I recognize
that kid.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it was really great because I spoke
every day during the Hempfest,
[SPEAKER_17]: so I was able to talk to patients.
[SPEAKER_17]: I talked to everyone about my story and
about other people's stories.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was actually on a panel talking about
why it's important for kids to be able to
[SPEAKER_17]: use cannabis and why it can help treat
some of their ailments.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really important for me because a
lot of people, even in legal states,
[SPEAKER_17]: are also still having trouble fighting the
law.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because you legalize doesn't really
mean that the fight is over.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just stepping into the ring.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of work left.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just for example, in Illinois,
they accidentally banned smokables for
[SPEAKER_17]: anyone under the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_17]: They accidentally banned RSO along with
that because they classified that as a
[SPEAKER_17]: smokable.
[SPEAKER_17]: That way they can get around the milligram
limit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that is also not allowed for anyone
under the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's absolutely unacceptable that
the milligram limit is that low in the
[SPEAKER_17]: first place that we have to go around to
classifying things as smokables just to
[SPEAKER_17]: get around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, honestly, kudos to you, Colton.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a patient myself as a Gulf War
veteran.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it very hard to go out there and
use my voice when I was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to give you mad props for being in
your teens and going out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: representing like a madman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your inner strength, your family support
network, everything around you,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to give you major props for
leading by example and being the strong
[SPEAKER_03]: individual that you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've risen above your own individual
condition and are now using as a catalyst
[SPEAKER_03]: to help others.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a leader, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took the words right out of my mouth,
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took the words right out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did we meet Colton?
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was 14 or 15 years old,
maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've come a long way, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think personally, although I know we've
all done a lot of work in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: space, but I've said it before and I'll
say it again, I really feel the last leg
[SPEAKER_02]: of prohibition will be with children.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that are going to be up
and coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're no longer a child now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you celebrated your 18th birthday
recently, but you definitely came into
[SPEAKER_02]: this as a child, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are still a young man, so it's super
props.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the people that the next generation
needs to hear from, not us old gray hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to take the torch and crush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome to see you on the stage in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely think that a lot of the
stigma is definitely ending because before
[SPEAKER_17]: I started cannabis, the talk about
marijuana was that it's bad and don't use
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now people are actually having
conversations with their kids about
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis and there are people who are
actually educated in the subject.
[SPEAKER_17]: People are getting the right information
and people are using it, making the right
[SPEAKER_17]: decisions around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: The kids that are around today have so
much more information than the last
[SPEAKER_17]: generation.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just asking time goes on, those kids are
going to get smarter and they're going to
[SPEAKER_17]: be more educated on cannabis and
eventually, everyone's going to have
[SPEAKER_17]: knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's nice about it now is that the
kids are learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: As before, there was no education for the
kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cause you psychosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the 80s where you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were smoking a joint, you were
hiding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were putting mouse spray on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were making sure you didn't smell like
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fantastic to see we are today in
today's era that the kids when I was 16
[SPEAKER_04]: are being educated on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being told they need to be
prevented of medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just great to see you speaking it,
showing exactly how cannabis saves your
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like myself, I want to tell the world how
much it helped me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like yourself, you want to tell the
world how much it's helping you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a thumbs up, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the student has become the teacher
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the best part about cannabis
is that you become a student and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to teach everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_04]: You become the teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: You become the professor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, you are the person that
everybody's looking at going, wow,
[SPEAKER_04]: look at how much it's helped you and saved
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're able to touch the people that are
suffering from the same condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people and I look at them and
they're like, dude, I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke one of these or take some CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there for us to just take and learn
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: On so many different levels too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's my level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't come into it as a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came into it as a recreational smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 14 years old puffing a joint with my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just grew to have that experience with
cannabis without really the more serious,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like the patient story,
the Colton Turners, the John Berfellows,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Etienne Fontaines, the patient stories
are powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people, when you have that patient
story, well, of course, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to tell every single person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, oh my goodness, you just dealt
with this ailment with this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: herb in a way that is super profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to hear someone be like,
oh yeah, I have that same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could not tell that person if your
lips were stapled shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would make it a point of telling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very profound.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I came out and said, hey,
I'm a Crohn's patient.
[SPEAKER_17]: I use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: I spoke out because Crohn's disease is a
very taboo disease.
[SPEAKER_17]: People don't like to talk about their
poop.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really important for me to speak
out because I felt like there was nobody
[SPEAKER_17]: else because when I first started
cannabis, nobody was talking about
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis and Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then after I started to get more and more
out there with my story, Crohn's patients
[SPEAKER_17]: would come out of the woodwork and go,
oh, I've been smoking for 10 years and
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis does great for me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, where were you?
[SPEAKER_17]: Why didn't you speak up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said, Colton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said because I'll tell you,
when you came out with your patient story,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a huge relief to me because now all
the people with Crohn's that were coming
[SPEAKER_02]: to me I was able to just direct over to
you because you actually, I don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use cannabis for Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I've read stories and I've heard
information from people, but you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: firsthand experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have something that goes beyond like,
well, what about clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know it works?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell that to Colton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Colton has gone even above that and
actually set up a foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Colton Turner Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just sent a friend of mine who
has a young daughter who has Crohn's and
[SPEAKER_03]: send him your direction so that he could
talk to your mom and talk to your support
[SPEAKER_03]: network and have an understanding as a
parent because he's in an illegal state
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's trying to figure out if he now
has to do what you did, Colton,
[SPEAKER_03]: and move to a legal state and be the
parent and actually move his family there
[SPEAKER_03]: so he can take care of his daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that she can at least have a semblance
of a normal life via cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She hasn't even tried cannabis yet,
but he's exhausted everything going the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal route that he needed access to
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, Colton and your parents have
come up with your own foundation so you
[SPEAKER_03]: can educate people further.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely, because one of the biggest
issues in my opinion, we can talk about
[SPEAKER_17]: what kind of, what kind of method is the
best way to use cannabis or, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: what strain, you know, works better,
but we're not going to know all of that
[SPEAKER_17]: without research because really,
I think that we just hit the tip of the
[SPEAKER_17]: iceberg when it comes to this plan.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we need to really learn
more about it because we're going to be,
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like we're going to over legislate
it and make too many regulations over it
[SPEAKER_17]: to the point where we can't really use it
to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that well, how can we regulate
something that we don't know?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and also whenever I go to a
doctor or a politician or a lawyer or
[SPEAKER_17]: anybody, the one thing that they always
tell me to completely discredit my story
[SPEAKER_17]: is, oh, well, there's no research.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I got tired and I said, well,
I'm going to fund my own research.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that way we can actually prove that
cannabis does help and is a safe,
[SPEAKER_17]: natural alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of cannabis research,
we look who just came into the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Dr. Ethan Russo popped in with the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh and Kelly just came in, so we should
welcome them to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colin as well just popped in from
Massachusetts from Happy Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice to see you, Colton.
[SPEAKER_10]: So beautiful seeing you here and talking
about things that are just really
[SPEAKER_10]: important.
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate you on our side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sarcasm that he approaches it
with, you know, this sort of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'd rather be illegally alive
than legally dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time I heard that,
I was kind of like, whoa, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_17]: The first time that I said it,
I was 14, which is, you know, you'd think
[SPEAKER_17]: that, you know, an adult would say that,
you know, somebody who's, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: really cool and intimidating.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, people who have like done,
like done the time, you know, but Colton,
[SPEAKER_03]: you did your time and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a hero.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've lived through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a survivor like the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a man now, but you were a man
surviving through that entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most kids never have to live with the
stigma, much less the trauma that you and
[SPEAKER_03]: your family had to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that saying comes from the heart,
from the soul of a survivor.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not sarcasm at all, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's no sarcasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean though, just that
harsh, like to them, to the other side,
[SPEAKER_02]: like for us, we love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But imagine being like in law enforcement
or something and hearing that from a 14
[SPEAKER_02]: year old boy, 14 year old boy that had to
move away from his grandparents so that he
[SPEAKER_02]: could, you know, as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're mad cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're all, if it wasn't for you guys,
then people who, then people like me
[SPEAKER_17]: wouldn't be able to have the information
that they have today.
[SPEAKER_17]: And people wouldn't be as educated as
they, you know, as they would be today
[SPEAKER_17]: because you guys are pushing the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys are pushing the subject.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that patients all around the
world appreciate it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're more of shoving it than pushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done playing Sisyphus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else can catch it going downhill
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone in the chat said that sounds
like something skunk man Sam would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really does actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, one of the big things
pushing the whole reality now is big
[SPEAKER_07]: business, big government taxing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smell the money and they want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I give them who makes the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want cannabis to be legal for every
use by everybody, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: True to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sam, you've been saying that for
20 years or more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally it came true about big
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are driving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're now paying for as much research
into cannabis for beneficial reasons as
[SPEAKER_07]: the NIA ever did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you go to the ICRSs,
I mean, Ethan, you go to all these events,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't you think that you can see this
incredible growth in the money that's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in for research?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is a lot of it is not aimed in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take the situation in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got something like 200 licensed
producers, but the main activity is
[SPEAKER_11]: mergers and acquisitions rather than
actual research.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's true with two exceptions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, a lot of what they're
gearing towards research is just
[SPEAKER_11]: observational studies, which are not
helpful from the standpoint of really
[SPEAKER_11]: convincing the physicians or the
regulators.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's nice corroboration for
those of us who already understand the
[SPEAKER_11]: medical benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, if it were up to me,
a lot of this money would be aimed in a
[SPEAKER_11]: different direction that I think could
advance the cause much more effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like much more effectively than paying
like 147 million euros for the Volcano
[SPEAKER_02]: Company or like 224 million for Anandinida
Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are some pretty, like I was
actually pretty surprised at some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian mergers and acquisitions that
have occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more so than the investment of
Constellation putting five billion
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian dollars in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, man, they got to put some of
that into research.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also the same as any new big
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when the automobile industry
started in America at the turn of the
[SPEAKER_07]: century, there were hundreds of automobile
companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now how many are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem to be the plan is to try and
be one of the big four or the big five or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the big number is going to be for
the way it is for so many other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the financial posturing has begun.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't worry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they'll just be folly,
you know, here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did someone say they had a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is Wade Lafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Russo, I imagine you saw the study
that was just published by Merrill and
[SPEAKER_00]: others in Israel on whole plant
preparations, decarboxylated and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-decarboxylated and their effects on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you could say what their premise was
and what were their findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where the funding was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was with Technion University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at commercially
available products in the Israeli market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got like 120 different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tested all of them for 89
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was clearly a lot of money behind
the study, but they picked 12 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations, whole plant preparations
with a whole range of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: tested them for efficacy against,
I think it was 20 different cancer cell
[SPEAKER_00]: lines in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, they kept controls of
straight THC and straight CBD and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they found some of the more unusual
cannabinoid mixes had really profoundly
[SPEAKER_00]: good results at low doses against a bunch
of different cell lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a lot of this work was done by David
Mayery in Israel at Technion.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know him.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen him numerous times.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, this is a good advance,
but we have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And interpreting these results,
what they're doing is testing different
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrations of material, either whole
cannabis extracts or fractions thereof or
[SPEAKER_11]: specific molecules in cell culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we have to remember is that a lot of
substances will kill cancer cells in cell
[SPEAKER_11]: culture, but that doesn't necessarily
translate to an effective treatment in
[SPEAKER_11]: humans.
[SPEAKER_11]: In this instance, yes, we know that
cannabinoids can kill cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_11]: They promote apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apoptosis is programmed cell death,
which sounds like a bad thing,
[SPEAKER_11]: but cells are supposed to have a normal
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens in cancer is that they're not
heeding the normal signals and they become
[SPEAKER_11]: immortalized, which is a way of saying
that they grow forever until something
[SPEAKER_11]: stops them, hopefully in medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that that kind of research can
aim us towards what might be effective
[SPEAKER_11]: agents to promote them through selective
breeding of various chemoverted lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: But ultimately, it's going to come down to
using these things in humans to see if
[SPEAKER_11]: they really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was fascinated by the study
because it seemed to suggest that the old
[SPEAKER_00]: school traditional way of making cannabis
preparations, actually it was a study that
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed our experience, which is the
right preparation seemed to have pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic effect with some cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks use really high doses,
but I personally have seen some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good results at low doses in folks that
don't really like cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have cancer and it's just a nice
confirmation of what I personally have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen and many other folks report that
something's going on with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer and many other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is most of the research in
order to be randomized, double blind,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
you having to use isolates and it misses
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole picture of what the plant can do
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was, yeah, that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of sounds maybe Ethan,
if you agree with this, like there's the
[SPEAKER_09]: isolating of cannabinoids and the
isolating of medicine for
[SPEAKER_09]: pharmaceuticalizing something and it has
its limitations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in Petri dish and Petro testing
has its limitations and really it seems to
[SPEAKER_09]: keep coming back to whole plant medicine,
having that reaction with our neurological
[SPEAKER_09]: system being, it seems to be confirmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, regardless of what you choose,
make it all available.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want my choice to hinder
your choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also welcome Nishi, you weren't in the
picture earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I want to say you guys do look
like an oil painting and I think so much
[SPEAKER_02]: take a screenshot and oil paint that
picture right there at the DEM pure
[SPEAKER_02]: camera, because that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I wrong?
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anyone does, I'll let her explain,
but it seems it's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Product relief.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my shelf.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: So nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for the great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: People hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, John, but Nishi.
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you going to say, John?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just said, can people hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was just saying, thank you all for
the great work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I live in Austin, Texas,
where cannabis is basically illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you do have a fairly wimpy CBD law
that serves a very small percentage of the
[SPEAKER_13]: population.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's glorified warehouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hemp law really.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, while it's super
frustrating that we aren't making more
[SPEAKER_13]: progress in my state, we're making
progress.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's wonderful to see that through
programs like this and the work that all
[SPEAKER_13]: of us are doing collectively, we are
making progress, even though it seems
[SPEAKER_13]: painfully slow for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is progress.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's super interesting to me at the
moment is the fact that the general public
[SPEAKER_13]: is finally catching up to where all of us
are.
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem seems to be that government
isn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I think that they're slowly
getting there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as they sort of come on board with
seeing that cannabis is the true medicine
[SPEAKER_13]: and that it's very safe and effective,
versatile medicine, hopefully we'll start
[SPEAKER_13]: to see better laws around the world that
reflect that, even though it's painful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that all of us have to
continue to stay the course and keep
[SPEAKER_13]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you think things will happen at
the UN level?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen the World Health Organization
and others actually start to go for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis medicine, but we thought a
potential vote was going to happen in the
[SPEAKER_03]: spring or potentially in the summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that has not yet arrived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're looking to 2020 at this
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can the individual watching here do
to put pressure on so that we can see the
[SPEAKER_03]: results in the end?
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, because of the work of the
World Health Organization, they really
[SPEAKER_11]: should have to make a vote this next
winter.
[SPEAKER_11]: The trouble is there's always someone
willing to throw a wrench in the gears and
[SPEAKER_11]: it looks like the Russians are opposed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it may be that they'll find a way to
put this off yet again.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the foundation is there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've already recommended that that
cannabidiol be rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_11]: There'd be rescheduling of other forms of
cannabis and THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that at whatever level people need
to pressure their politicians,
[SPEAKER_11]: particularly on a federal level,
to try and get this resolved.
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to understand that ultimately,
I think it's economics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Money is what talks.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can convince people that there's
money to be made through cannabis commerce
[SPEAKER_11]: and that the prison industrial complex is
not a benefit to society, then there may
[SPEAKER_11]: be changes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ain't that the truth right there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question about Parkinson's for
Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could ask a question here,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a pleasure asking this question,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had a family member.
[SPEAKER_14]: My father has had Parkinson's for 16 years
to date.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we found a regiment of THC and CBD not
quite a one-to-one with specific terpenes
[SPEAKER_14]: that have helped his neurological being.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to know if you had ever seen
any profound effects in your time with
[SPEAKER_14]: Parkinson's and cannabinoid-based
therapies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know as our family, it's been extremely
confusing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something that has really been a
guiding light for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to simply ask the
question and see what your thoughts were.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a tough area.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like some of the other conditions
where you rapidly can see a benefit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Various preparations have been tried in
Parkinson's and with mixed results.
[SPEAKER_11]: My feeling is that most often,
a small amount of THC is going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: helpful with a larger amount of CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the best results that we know of
to date have come in an entirely different
[SPEAKER_11]: form.
[SPEAKER_11]: About 15 years ago, there was a very good
survey study that came out of the Czech
[SPEAKER_11]: Republic by Venderova and all.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened there was there was a fellow
that was eating what appeared to be raw
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly don't know whether it was
THC-predominant or hemp that would be
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD-predominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think THC-predominant and over the
course of a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_11]: he improved his symptoms.
[SPEAKER_11]: This fellow was on Czech TV, their
equivalent of 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently, a lot of people started
doing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: They had some 200-odd patients that had
done this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what the findings were, that almost
all aspects of Parkinson's would improve.
[SPEAKER_11]: But after a prolonged interval,
that people were getting their best
[SPEAKER_11]: results.
[SPEAKER_11]: After three months of using raw cannabis
ingested rather than inhaled.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what that suggests to me is probably it
was either a combination of THC-A,
[SPEAKER_11]: possibly with CBD-A.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, something is happening very
slowly here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's quite different to someone
treating their pain acutely or treating
[SPEAKER_11]: their spasticity acutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, there hasn't been a real
follow-up on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But like anything else, but particularly
with Parkinson's, experimentation is gonna
[SPEAKER_11]: be needed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would really wonder about
cannabinoid acids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, combinations.
[SPEAKER_12]: CBGA and CBG as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've gone through hundreds of cultivars,
literally.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I found is after a while,
for my father at least, the effects of
[SPEAKER_14]: those said cultivars or strains,
if you will, start to taper off and I have
[SPEAKER_14]: to start looking again.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we keep trying and we keep trying.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been a vicious cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to your point, we have noticed that in
acid form, THC-A is more profound for him
[SPEAKER_14]: than if we decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So just the way he works, his body
responds better to that for some reason.
[SPEAKER_14]: So really interesting and really
solidifies a lot of things we've been
[SPEAKER_14]: doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you suggest that they do from a
dietary or microbiome and endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: tone building supplementation program for
that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my feeling is that so many of the
disorders we're seeing in modern society
[SPEAKER_11]: are related to inflammatory and autoimmune
processes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that in the 21st century,
these things are really common,
[SPEAKER_11]: whereas in the 19th century, they were
exceptionally rare.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the differences are diets.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a big proponent now of prebiotics and
probiotics, getting that gut balance in.
[SPEAKER_11]: My feeling is that the gut microbiome is
the master regulator of the
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can treat things that way and
supplement with cannabinoids subsequently.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think between the two that we've got
possible effective treatments for a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: man's ills.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking medicinal mushrooms fit
in there, too, as well with their
[SPEAKER_09]: neurological aid with Lion's Mane and the
other neutropic regenerative cell.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just said neutropics at the exact same
time I did, but I was muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome to hear your voice come out
of my... That was a trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, cosmic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of toxins in this world
nowadays, and they're finding 10,000
[SPEAKER_09]: plastic particles in one liter of snow in
the Arctic right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is just a lot of overload in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even things like activated charcoal is
not a cannabis thing, but it's a way of
[SPEAKER_09]: detoxing our system and helping our
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a combination of
cannabinoids and terpenes, but it's also a
[SPEAKER_09]: combination of other herbal properties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that Josh just touched on
something that I think is really important
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as detoxification.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we're always talking
about what kind of things that we can add
[SPEAKER_10]: to our body to help boost our immune
system.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think also it's important to start
looking at how we can detoxify our cells,
[SPEAKER_10]: our intestinal system, so that these other
treatments that come after that work
[SPEAKER_10]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to add that with
Parkinson's, also the medication you take,
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what it's called, Veldopa or
whatever, it causes severe nausea in some
[SPEAKER_07]: patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a real problem, and cannabis
can help with severe nausea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's so true.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So for my father, he was a 101st airborne,
1st to the 506.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he was directly involved in Vietnam and
out on recon by himself with two other
[SPEAKER_14]: gentlemen that was a sharpshooter and the
other guy was dismantling bombs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they would just get rained on with
Deet, literally.
[SPEAKER_14]: He would tell stories of just walking
through the jungle and all of a sudden be
[SPEAKER_14]: like, boom, and just get nailed with just
this toxic stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's insane to me that it took so long
for his body to, basically, he's fending
[SPEAKER_14]: all this stuff off for so long.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it just overcame his neurological
being and himself, and really took our
[SPEAKER_14]: family for a storm.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was very confusing.
[SPEAKER_14]: No one wanted to admit that he had it.
[SPEAKER_14]: No doctors wanted to sign him off as that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were just left confused.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very interesting that- Here's a
question.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you taking- Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asking, is he taking any amino acids
by any chance along with his cannabis?
[SPEAKER_14]: He is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing- Like tyrosine or- He does the
wrong diet as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I take a lot of amino acids and
there was a paper, Why Amino Acids Work,
[SPEAKER_04]: that I worked on with Maurice Stegman
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just looked it up and it looks on
the perfect- Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It states what we were just researching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin, that's par for the course.
[SPEAKER_03]: The VA will deny and yeah, they basically
give some of the worst healthcare
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have my own healthcare
because they told me the blisters on my
[SPEAKER_03]: feet for nine years were all in my head
and all kinds of other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until five years down the
line that a brave doctor actually told me
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were told to lie to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two years later, I got a nine
page breakdown of everything I was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually exposed to due to overrunning
positions and having all these bunkers
[SPEAKER_03]: blown up around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually modus operandi for the VA
to deny, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it is diligent upon you and
your family to throw it back in their face
[SPEAKER_03]: and be as blunt, honest, and capture as
much as your anger to them as possible and
[SPEAKER_03]: vitriol.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, I'm in Philadelphia often.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do work with University of Pennsylvania,
which is, you know, there's some smart
[SPEAKER_14]: people and great people over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it is still confusing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's nice to hear a lot of this stuff
from y'all.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it really helps better understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make copies of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to lose your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you have your own copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had my paperwork lost from DAV,
American Legion, VFW.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me four or five different filings
just to get my Gulf War syndrome stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denial is always the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's again upon you and your family to
be as educated and throw it back in their
[SPEAKER_03]: face as possible because the majority of
these doctors, remember 80% of physicians
[SPEAKER_03]: go through the VA system because it's
immediate residency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get the good, the bad, and the
ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had more than my share of ugly,
but there's some good ones out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I choose to use regular physicians in the
regular world, which is why I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: business and insurance and I cover my
insurance as well as most of my employees
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, because healthcare in America
still sucks and it should be a right,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we still have to take care of our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is kind of empowering, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite confusing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You kind of like, oh, well I can't rely on
the system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I find here in Canada,
people rely on the system so much that
[SPEAKER_09]: they turn off their self-reliance button.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, oh, I don't have to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not saying that definitely medical
care is the way to go, but also just
[SPEAKER_09]: continue learning like we're doing here is
really where we're going to end up.
[SPEAKER_14]: No doubt, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you have a question?
[SPEAKER_13]: What is your dad's intake method?
[SPEAKER_14]: His delivery for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_14]: So I make pills.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now he buys them, but we started
where I would make pills for him and also
[SPEAKER_14]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really the delivery method of
his preferred delivery method.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would do that three times a day,
two to three times a day.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where we started out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're just down to once a day.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the way that we found was the
best way for him to intake and ingest
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis for him.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we chose to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: How well controlled or have you sent them?
[SPEAKER_14]: So they were wildly out of control at one
point.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now they are controlled.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's actually going on a trip to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's feeling like he's going to go to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to Spain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's working out three times a week,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really on him about what he should be
doing to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a thing where it's tough because
you want to have all this energy and you
[SPEAKER_14]: want him to have all this excitement that
I share and have and all this belief.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he just doesn't have it because it's
the disease.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's causing him to feel all these things
from depression all the way to lack of
[SPEAKER_14]: motivation and all these things that you
have to remind him like, hey, you're here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to be here with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are the things that allow him to
overcome those hard tasks, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_14]: So three times a week, he gets out and he
walks every day, which is great.
[SPEAKER_14]: So obviously, some days are better than
others.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the way that it's built.
[SPEAKER_14]: The disease has its own mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really fascinating just when you
think you've got it, you're like,
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah, I got this.
[SPEAKER_14]: It totally changes and morphs and does its
thing on you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's absolutely mind bending.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it makes me work harder.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's why I'm in mass and why I'm around
all these universities and minds that I
[SPEAKER_14]: can collaborate with to try to help better
understand not only what I'm going
[SPEAKER_14]: through, but what they're trying to do
with cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can all together find a more
profound understanding to make a more
[SPEAKER_14]: informative choice.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something I struggle with all
the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, the delivery method has been
tinctures and I think it's really and
[SPEAKER_14]: pills.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are the two right now that we
found really helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really fabulous.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make a medicinal mushroom, hemp oil
combination oil, and it's something that's
[SPEAKER_09]: not really very common and something we've
used for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would really love to send some to
you if you're interested, he can give it a
[SPEAKER_09]: try.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the lion's mane and the red belted
conch and chaga and a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just feel very inspired with the
mushroom realm as much as the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to bring them together, I think
sometimes it's just a fusion.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't know what it is,
but anyway, yeah, we'd just be willing to
[SPEAKER_16]: love that thought.
[SPEAKER_16]: What are the active ingredients in those
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's obviously not psilocybin,
is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really would love for it to be
psilocybin, but we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are really actually really actively
looking for, you know, being able to
[SPEAKER_09]: define exactly what's in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But so what you know, it's the
polysaccharides and the beta gluten.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a water soluble extract from the
mushroom oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an oil extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: The mushrooms are steam extracted and then
it goes into a lipid extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also use a combination of fungi.
[SPEAKER_09]: We use live polypores from the tree as
well as dual extracted chagas and
[SPEAKER_09]: different ingredients for the
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, in the name of science, guys,
let's do a little analytical chemistry and
[SPEAKER_16]: figure out what are the molecules in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're aromatic molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones from Lion's Mane are known as
haricinones and aranosines, diterpene
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, and they spur production of NGF
in nerve cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm doing right now,
thus helping to maintain cholinergic
[SPEAKER_02]: system and core brain function.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just Lion's Mane.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of nootropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul Stamets has an enormous amount of
information on these mushrooms on his.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're not alkaloids, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_16]: The compounds are alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this particular instance,
the bioactive is in Lion's Mane's,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a whole bunch of nootropic
mushrooms, like he just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaga, which is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a there's a there's a
swack of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Memory and nerve support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know Paul Stamets is getting into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that, Kelly?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just saying, Mark, we were talking
to you a little bit earlier and we did
[SPEAKER_10]: want to get to the bottom of this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use you know, we've never really
separated cannabis and mycology in
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've always mixed the two and had
tremendous results from the patients who
[SPEAKER_10]: have been taking it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, there's so much unknown
because we weren't able to test it in a
[SPEAKER_10]: regular testing facility because it also
had cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we have this ability to move
forward and really find out what is in
[SPEAKER_10]: this medicine that's been working so well
for people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, now that there's plenty of
labs around that can do cannabis testing,
[SPEAKER_16]: a lot of them do have the analytical
instrumentation to figure out what some of
[SPEAKER_16]: these other minor compounds might be that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was reading last week or the week before
that the flavonoids are 800 times more
[SPEAKER_04]: stronger than aspirin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tylenol and certain things that
researchers just came up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a big article on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to find it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody read that?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to head out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say a happy belated birthday,
D420, as well as congrats on your
[SPEAKER_03]: business, Bubble Man, and Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming in, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many blessings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colton, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm celebrating my 50th this week as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren, you haven't said it for yet today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it 53 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just such good conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I interrupt that shit, honestly?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I'll give it a good one here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bong rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and we got to, we got to, this is in
honor of Brandon Vizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that he's a big fan and if he
could get a shout out, it would make his
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, well, if that's going to
make his day, then shout out to Brandon
[SPEAKER_02]: Vizzle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Bong Riff, Brandon, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Foot up, Brandon Vizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm only going to do a two hour hash
church today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got another hour left of dialogue
and happy to take it in whatever direction
[SPEAKER_02]: that it goes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just happy to be joining on the Sunday
morning with all of you wonderful people
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been, it's been too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could I try to steer this in a little
direction?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of off topic, what we were
talking about before, but I would really
[SPEAKER_06]: like, what would be the easy, well,
not easy start, but how would a guy like
[SPEAKER_06]: myself who hasn't done the living soil or
any of that sort of stuff before,
[SPEAKER_06]: where would I get started on this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting started on learning living soils.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we did do a good hash church on
soils a year ago or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look back and resource that,
it has a lot of information on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are people that analyze soils
like Leighton Morrison and Scott Granola
[SPEAKER_09]: online.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are people that do, you know,
help people with living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can look them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also work with people.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can hit us up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, we might be seeing you
soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't say that there's like a book
out there that says something on living
[SPEAKER_09]: soils and this is exactly how to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's more linking up with farms
that are doing the work and doing testing
[SPEAKER_09]: along with their soils.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Flo and Fall's books are worth
checking out though.
[SPEAKER_09]: His teaming books.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff Lowenfeld has teaming with microbes
and teaming with fungi and teaming with
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of those are incredible scientific
tools.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one, a new one by Michael Phillips
is really great on soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even I found it a little technical,
but if you understand very detailed,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not specific to cannabis,
but it'll give you all the background
[SPEAKER_11]: information that you need.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if we start transitioning the
mind work and what we've been already
[SPEAKER_10]: taught by Big Ag is that, you know,
it's the soil that's feeding the plants
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than the nutrients that you're
giving it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everything that you're putting into
your soil, you have to wonder how is it
[SPEAKER_10]: affecting your soil?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your soil eating?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all of the exudates from the
microbiology within the soil, then
[SPEAKER_10]: transfer over to the feeding of the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just transferring your mind over to let
the soil feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a super helpful way to look at it
and what kind of things in nature like
[SPEAKER_10]: soil, what kind of things in nature are
digesting soil very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, you know, carbon that's
already happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're just transitioning our mind,
it's almost like once you start getting
[SPEAKER_10]: into the microbiology, then the
microbiology takes over the education in
[SPEAKER_10]: your mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you're actually being educated by
the microbiology itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Josh seriously just come into the
room?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are your ears burning, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get my headphones to work,
but I'm having difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this platform, it works really
good, even without headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, Darren was just like,
okay, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to steer this in a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I learn about living soils?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then literally they started talking
and I was just kind of looking around,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then I looked down and I'm like,
when did he come into the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all yours too, because I kind of want
to start doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about living soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think also, you know, living soils is a
term that describes an action and the
[SPEAKER_09]: action of a living soil is decomposing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when soil is decomposing, it's
advancing the microbiology and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: advancing the nutrients that's going in
the roots.
[SPEAKER_09]: So traditionally in cannabis growing,
a lot of people bought soil that was
[SPEAKER_09]: finished.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it had this maybe peat moss or
cocoa, and it was this finished,
[SPEAKER_09]: cooked down soil with all the nutrients in
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you bought this finished soil and then
you added teas to it throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't really alive in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we're learning now with living
soils is using, you know, combinations of
[SPEAKER_09]: raw materials in the beginning and the
making of the soil, like different
[SPEAKER_09]: alfalfas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And haze and different carbon sources,
along with certain parts of biochar,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is sort of a charcoal in the soil,
which allows microorganisms to live,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's also somewhat of a filter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you add in a nice mulcher top
layer to the soil to continue the feeding
[SPEAKER_09]: of the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can use, you know,
fermented plant teas really, really easy
[SPEAKER_09]: from there every once in a while,
every couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: or whatever it is to add to your soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So making a really rich soil is really the
ticket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's a lot like,
you know, when you invite friends over to
[SPEAKER_10]: dinner, you usually write them and say,
hey, what are your dietary restrictions?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it that my friends like to eat?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of fungi do you want in your
soil?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you ask the question,
oh, well, what does that fungi want to
[SPEAKER_10]: eat?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're going to be inviting in all
these different beneficial microbiology,
[SPEAKER_10]: they have to be eating.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in order to colonize, they have to be
eating.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're really focused on what I like to
eat in order to stick around and colonize.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which will bring more terpenes and more
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the one thing that I sure noticed
about the stuff that was grown in living
[SPEAKER_06]: soil was the taste and the buzz,
the smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the stuff, like I was sitting in my
room the other day doing my measurements
[SPEAKER_06]: on this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do the proper measurements as they
say on the label.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do my own measurements as I feel that
the plants can take with my nutrient
[SPEAKER_06]: levels and that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do my own little tweaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is like, basically we can teach a
monkey to do that and he can run the show
[SPEAKER_06]: no problem if that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's really nice to open
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's that living soil where,
I tasted it and was just, what the hell is
[SPEAKER_06]: that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you can almost taste the earth
that it's grown in as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the concentrates from it too,
mind blowing, earth moving, life changing
[SPEAKER_06]: type situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm like, well, you know,
I'm a pretty good grower, I guess with
[SPEAKER_06]: doing measurements and pH and water and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I could take those strains,
the cultivars that I have and make them
[SPEAKER_06]: better and how they are right now,
and they could be better because of that
[SPEAKER_06]: living soil mix, I need to learn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I wanted to bring up,
I get a lot of indoor growers talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: me and asking questions and how to do,
you know, living soil beds indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've kind of all seen the model on
Instagram where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric pots, you know, eight, 12 inches
deep, you know, these beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I I've just been learning and able
to talk with different folks and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience growing outdoors and in a
greenhouse that is connected to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because I used to do this method
for about 10 years and learning with
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton is we realize that if you're not
connected to the earth, you have problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, you know, there's there's
electrical issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not physically grounded to the
earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you know, a lot of people miss
the mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Josh and Kelly, you know, the way they
do it, they do lots of these layers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a moisture cap,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it holds all the moisture in and
regulates the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing we're really
getting into is, you know, instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: having this 12 inch layer of what we're
calling the organic horizon, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are making up this the peat
mixture, you know, third peat,
[SPEAKER_01]: a third aeration, a third compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really an organic horizon in a
natural earth setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're missing the a horizon,
the alluvial layer that is made up of
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the importance of that is it's doing
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's balancing the moisture throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you you water, you don't get all
this runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this this balance of, you know,
moisture in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're seeing like really
long term success in an indoor platform,
[SPEAKER_01]: because then once you establish the right
biology, you know, via a good compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes will actually start
harvesting the nutrients from that
[SPEAKER_01]: alluvial layer, the sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you won't need to be top dressing
after after a period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I just want to kind of throw
that into this discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, you know, if you Josh and
Kelly, if you've experienced or done any
[SPEAKER_01]: of that work with when you consult with
indoor grows, but.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just something we're seeing alluvial for
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fun word.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, you know, having those
are essentially trace minerals to,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and when it comes in the sand
and it comes in the clay layers and
[SPEAKER_09]: volcanic ash layers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is really smart.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there has been like the the
that was also another teaching was having
[SPEAKER_09]: the soil drain out really fast,
you know, and then really, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then re aerate it, which is kind of
almost like flood and drain a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you're you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's being able to contain the
moisture keeps the life alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, the microbiology has to sort of
die out and then regrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think you get more supple
trichomes in the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Darren and and maybe and Mike,
you know, the extract artists that are
[SPEAKER_09]: taking the extraction from that healthy
sphere.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, I think that, you know,
you were saying that you're getting a
[SPEAKER_10]: better flavor and taste when you put a
plant in its natural environment,
[SPEAKER_10]: because plants natural environment is
soil, then you're going to bring out the
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimate potential of that particular
strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we've seen is that we've been
able to take really old strains that have
[SPEAKER_10]: been played out for lack of better term.
[SPEAKER_10]: And be able to put them in our deep,
rich soil beds for a whole season and
[SPEAKER_10]: totally regenerate that plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of regeneration talk with
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to really put in the hot
regeneration of these strains through deep
[SPEAKER_10]: soil, living soil techniques as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would just add that I've seen this
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have documentation of plants that
are approaching three meters in height now
[SPEAKER_11]: that were this high six weeks ago,
just through these techniques.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just with water, good soil and
water and a lot of sunshine and a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: the big leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we had that big leaf picture on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have lots of plants with big
leaves like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And anyway, it's and it's not strain
dependent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I really want to encourage
people that have a played out strain that
[SPEAKER_10]: they've really loved and they've held on
to for a whole long time, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: give it to somebody else or start doing
living soil techniques on their own to
[SPEAKER_10]: rejuvenate this strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that that's going to be really
helpful in the industry into the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also add that when you carry that
out, living soils give a structure to the
[SPEAKER_09]: trichome that allows you to cure the plant
better afterwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it gives a longevity to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, you know, another thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, you know, this thing where,
you know, you have to sell your your
[SPEAKER_09]: flowers within two weeks of harvesting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of times a lot of people
there's a lot of people up here in British
[SPEAKER_09]: Columbia and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be like two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, you lose out on curing your
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were talking about this the other
night and just CBN or something,
[SPEAKER_09]: a newer cannabinoid that can happen after
time, you know, one year and two years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that living soils also allows
you to have better medicine and you can
[SPEAKER_09]: cure it longer, which allows you to do
different things with your medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully people like Colton or other,
you know, patients can get different kinds
[SPEAKER_09]: of cures out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I love about living soil is you have
the opportunity to control what things you
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by finding the inputs that you need on
your property, it's the biology that works
[SPEAKER_00]: on your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you buy by concentrating and enhancing
it in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start one, not only increasing the
quality of the material you're producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you decrease your costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not having to go buy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, every time you go and buy
something, you're trusting that what the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag or bag or box or whatever that
packaging is, is actually what is in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, what it's says is actually what's
in the bag and nothing else is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that's a trust that I don't know if
especially if you're making something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're growing your own or
doing commercial production, if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest quality, you need to know
what's in the soil because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pull out whatever it needs and wants
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I love the idea of live soil and
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just really, it's what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's true is most soils are not live
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been killed off with too many
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from glyphosate to,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems really important to
recognize that especially for anyone that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to work with cannabis by
reducing your costs and increasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, regenerative practices and living
soil is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get the best medicine at the
best result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, it's a form of environmental
stewardship because the soil is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of everything that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are killing off our soils all over
the world, we're killing off our
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to survive in the whole
climate thing that's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a whole conversation I don't even
want to start, but we all know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, regenerative agriculture
practices is a way of healing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: little garden and then maybe your
community and maybe someday our world.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, when Canadians
accidentally discovered that hemp removes
[SPEAKER_02]: radioactive nucleotides out of the soil,
when Joe Strobel, a tobacco farmer got the
[SPEAKER_02]: first hemp license in Canada and grew a
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, because he's a tobacco
farmer, he's actively spraying radium-226
[SPEAKER_02]: on his field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have to monitor the
radioactivity levels of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the soil was too low after hemp and
they were just like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: And tested the hemp and were kind of like,
oh geez, this has actually been pulled
[SPEAKER_02]: into this plant over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the Chernobyl hemp growing
project got started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I like the way Wade put
that, you know, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, someone was telling me yesterday
in Kentucky, oh, all these tobacco plots
[SPEAKER_02]: want to grow cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow, they're going to be
growing like many, many seasons of just
[SPEAKER_02]: remediative crops because the soils in
those tobacco regions are so beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated with like really,
really like, forget about Avid and Michael
[SPEAKER_02]: Butanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these guys are taking it to a whole
other level where you have to wear full
[SPEAKER_02]: hazmat suits to spray that shit on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frightening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus, do they take that material and
combust it or incinerate it, or do they
[SPEAKER_09]: put it back into the soil and remediate it
through time?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, originally there was two
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the archaic burning and
glassifying of the ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the Russian electron
scientist who was using electron clusters
[SPEAKER_02]: to manipulate and basically take apart
radioactive molecules.
[SPEAKER_12]: They re-extract it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's valuable.
[SPEAKER_16]: I would think that that would have to be
neutron, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're doing radiochemistry,
you're dealing with neutrons, you're not
[SPEAKER_16]: dealing necessarily with electrons.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not a radio chemist.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hemp that they grew in Chernobyl,
they just made it in the hemp creek just
[SPEAKER_12]: to encase it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But they did save some of it and look at
doing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure a fair amount of it found its way
into Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was our company that did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you knew that,
but that was our company that did that.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was going to say, I wouldn't be
surprised if any of that hemp was actually
[SPEAKER_16]: used somewhere in Eastern Europe for CBD
oil production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's sold at gas stations in Florida
now in pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two bucks a pen can't be beat.
[SPEAKER_16]: Forget Florida, even in cannabis
unfriendly states like Illinois and
[SPEAKER_16]: Indiana.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you go to the truck stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two bucks a pen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just saw a whole case full of CBD gummy
bears at a road stop and it was very
[SPEAKER_14]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the state trooper that pulls you over
and busts you for cannabis is all jacked
[SPEAKER_16]: up on CBD from the gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that radioactive CBD though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of humorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a hemp license and a THD
cannabis recreational license and my
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor finally complained and my
enforcement officer for the rec came up to
[SPEAKER_01]: visit and he's like, they look the same,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you don't do it until you test
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: True that.
[SPEAKER_01]: True that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I, you know,
I'm explaining it to him and he's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like going, well, how do we regulate this?
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone's driving down the road and
they got a bag full of CBD buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I'm like, you don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the way we're doing it now doesn't
make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go back to letting it be a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, I actually am very in,
in some Twitter twisted way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very thankful to one of the big ag
companies, Monsanto and them for creating
[SPEAKER_01]: such, such freedoms for, for farmers and
in the main, you know, the U S we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of freedoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so under the hemp bill, we don't have
to do any of the regulatory bullshit that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to do on the, on the rec side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's amazing, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so are they.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to give them praise,
please.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's worth noting that Wade,
when you created the Harlequin,
[SPEAKER_09]: that you were grounding your pots at the
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct with copper wire into the
ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing indoors in those days and
all of the plants were in shallow 10
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots that and were bone side and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd done a lot of work on making sure the
water and the soil they were in and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what nutrients I was given them were
things I liked and had the best lighting I
[SPEAKER_00]: could find on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in sitting with them one evening,
asking them why they were not,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell it wasn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't totally happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, and what I heard was they were
lonely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to think about what that meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that plants evolved in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a copper water pipe in the
room that I had installed and knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: good to ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hooked up some Romex 10-3,
so four connectors, put them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: grounding bar that I strapped to the
copper pipe and then put the other end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Romex into four of the first seven
plants that became Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of how Harlequin got the name it
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the four plants that got ground
were identical to three other plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get ground that had the identical
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the four that had ground not only grew
much quicker, had bigger leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: their flowers two weeks into flowering
were 50% larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at eight weeks into flowering,
the plants that had ground had four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five different colors vegetation,
red, purple, orange, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: green, a little bit of yellow,
but just they were fluorescent coloration
[SPEAKER_00]: in this whole room of green plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that yeah, plants need
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, I got busy running a bunch
of wires that were not connected to any
[SPEAKER_00]: form of electricity other than the six to
seven cycles a second that the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produces that we call ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now working outdoors where I can put
plants in the ground, you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: wires, you don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think it's a huge part of the
living soil thing when everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: right in your indoor room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't provided them a connection
to the earth give them earth, do it a few
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time just to check out to see how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll be amazed at the difference
in the results you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants love being in connection with
the mother, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, go ahead Nisha.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was just gonna say that actually
visiting here with Josh and Kelly,
[SPEAKER_13]: this is the first time that I've actually
toured an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have to tell you that what they're
doing is so phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when Ethan and I drove up,
it was immediately obvious that this place
[SPEAKER_13]: is so alive and producing extraordinary
medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it makes a tremendous difference,
not only for all of us, but most
[SPEAKER_13]: especially for those who are trying to
restore their bodies with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would say for anybody that is out
there thinking about growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: please look at what Josh and Kelly and all
the other regenerative farmers are doing
[SPEAKER_13]: because the soil I would argue is really
our greatest resource.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people would argue the point that
water is, but I think that the soil is far
[SPEAKER_13]: more important because if you don't have
living soil, you can't use your water
[SPEAKER_13]: properly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can lose nutrients that go
into the rivers and they can contaminate
[SPEAKER_09]: waterways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you work with land trusts and
different things in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's something you're really
interested in, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I spent 10 years working in the land
trust community in Texas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And without well-managed soil,
even no matter what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it's growing medicine or food or
just open pasture, the land should have
[SPEAKER_13]: the capacity to capture and clean our
water supply, not just for cannabis users
[SPEAKER_13]: and growers, but for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so having healthy soil is really kind
of a gift to the world that we can all
[SPEAKER_13]: participate in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's interesting too,
if you really look at what the main number
[SPEAKER_10]: one job of nature, it's making soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nature's number one job.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And without healthy soil, we don't have
clean water to drink.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then without the healthy soil,
we don't have the healthy microbiology
[SPEAKER_10]: that comes from the soil to help boost our
own microbiome.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just add a last minute statement
to that, which is hemp farming is a really
[SPEAKER_09]: big deal right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's alarming to me and it looks to me
like an environmental disaster is
[SPEAKER_09]: happening with all of the plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please stop using plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know of a 100% plant-based
plastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if there was a hundred percent
plant-based plastic, I still wouldn't use
[SPEAKER_09]: it because hay and cover cropping is
essential to a regenerative hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have the ability to grow a cover
crop over the winter, that's chest high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you till in that whole thing
along with another batch of cover crop and
[SPEAKER_09]: then mound that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're having all this microbiology being
created with the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you layer in huge amounts of hay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't tell me it's too much work
because it's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe don't do 20 acres, do five and do
it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And go get your uncle Ted and all the
other guys to go do five acres too,
[SPEAKER_09]: and just do it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then you're building your soil over the
course of the year and you're creating.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said aphids because they're around
and you can't control aphids very well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are realizing that everywhere
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pollinators can take care of them very
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So creating habitat within your farm is
essential and living soils, living soil,
[SPEAKER_09]: regenerative hemp farms, plastic mulch,
environmental disaster.
[SPEAKER_13]: You heard it here for the first time on
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just do it right.
[SPEAKER_13]: The title of the forthcoming book on
living soil from Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not impressed with all your acreage.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're impressed with the quality of what
you come out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen to that because honestly I'm
constantly having conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, we're looking at
10,000 acres in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing 7,700 hectares in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, do you understand how much
biomass can be grown on an acre like with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you shift the bed a couple
thousand pounds, but if you do pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good, you're going to probably get 4,000
pounds off an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 7,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the math for this guy without even
multiplying his field by four because he's
[SPEAKER_02]: easily going to get four crops in a year
in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just with one year on this guy's 7,700
hectares, it ended up being like 60
[SPEAKER_02]: million pounds of biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he was able to extract a hundred
thousand pounds of that biomass a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: which let's be honest, very few or
anywhere near that, it was going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: them 9.7 years to extract his first crop
if he only grew one crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought in Switzerland in 2000,
2001, everyone got greedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start planting big acreages and all
the herb rotted in barns.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't understand the SOPs of cutting
that much cannabis down and curing it and
[SPEAKER_02]: having a space to properly dry it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just getting it off the field,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that in Kentucky in 2009 and 10,
where I went out to a mass of,
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, 600 acres.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for 2009 and 10 in the United States,
that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were just like, how do we get
this off the field?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had to design this crazy system for
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now fast forward today, I'm a part of
a small farmer's network in New York
[SPEAKER_14]: state, and it's all organic.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're forging and finding everything
on the land to feed to the crops.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just a completely different way
of doing things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a much nicer way to be in touch with
your plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you shucking and bucking right on the
field?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like you're out in the field shucking and
bucking?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what the Amish are doing here in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very manual.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't wait to see it happen in just a
few weeks here.
[SPEAKER_16]: All the Amish farms around us are growing
hemp.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's great, if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I mean, you were mentioning
the use of plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the Amish don't use any mulch at
all.
[SPEAKER_16]: They do cover crops and they do certainly
rotate their fields.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't think there's use of plastic
mulch at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe it's all certified as
organic too.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't wait to watch the Amish do
their hemp harvest as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Amish are definitely the exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's talking about like everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you got to remember they call them
strawberries, but nobody grows them on
[SPEAKER_07]: straw.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all grow them underneath black mulch,
plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they taste like wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can get the strawberries grown
that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, I lean towards your
direction.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, one of the hallmarks of the Amish is
that they do peacefully coexist in today's
[SPEAKER_16]: agriculture production and do have a
significant agricultural output,
[SPEAKER_16]: at least in this area of Pennsylvania and
certainly in other areas of the country.
[SPEAKER_16]: So be that as it may, yeah, they're
different and they have different farming
[SPEAKER_16]: methods.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're here and they're producing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think they're going to have a
profound impact on the hemp supply,
[SPEAKER_16]: at least this season, that we hadn't seen
in previous seasons.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, to your point, they're very advanced
in farming.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up around Amish and I've learned
quite a lot as a young guy working on
[SPEAKER_14]: Amish farms, being around it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're very intuitive and they have a
much different head on their shoulders in
[SPEAKER_14]: terms of how to accomplish something in
terms of task orientations.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we can look at the scaling of Amish
and the reason why it is so successful in
[SPEAKER_10]: the way that the Amish are doing
agriculture is because it's many families
[SPEAKER_10]: per large acreage.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not one company that's running 70,000
acres.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people ask us, can you
successfully scale cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you successfully scale cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: And my question back to them is,
show me a big scaling in big ag that's
[SPEAKER_10]: actually successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my feelings is that the big
scaling and big ag is not successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the way that we can successfully scale
in cannabis is taking large acreage and
[SPEAKER_10]: having many families or many growers or
many farmers take over that acreage.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the way to successfully scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the acreage that you guys grow
yourselves?
[SPEAKER_07]: Five.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have five acres not of straight
cannabis, but five acres that we take care
[SPEAKER_09]: of.
[SPEAKER_09]: And probably about three acres of it is
crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason is because we're still
under medical license here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to enter into the CTLS and we
have plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really the reason why we have
five acres that could be cultivated,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we're not utilizing the whole amount.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how many plants does that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the plant license?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many plants do you grow generally?
[SPEAKER_09]: It changes every year because it's,
you know, depending on what medical
[SPEAKER_09]: license we have at the time or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it's really changing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just like to stay underneath any
numbers that are licensed to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now we're less than five thousand
because you can't grow more than five
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand large ones on five acres.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at more like two,
two thousand and our plant license is for
[SPEAKER_10]: fifteen hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: So by the time we call and we ruthlessly
call because we are breeders.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we go through and do a ruthless call of
not only males, but ones that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, maybe aren't showing,
you know, high immune response.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we'll get what is your average
plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so we start our seeds on April 20th
around there and then we'll do another
[SPEAKER_09]: wave, maybe a month later of seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, it's definitely a variation,
but I'd say about eight feet to ten feet
[SPEAKER_09]: tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you say?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, eight to twelve.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, our Himachal prey dash plants
that we have that we're not light depping
[SPEAKER_10]: are probably about 13, 14 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we start our seeds then and then
they grow naturally and we don't use any
[SPEAKER_09]: trellising or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the plants are naturally just being
able to support them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a strong believer in biodynamic
organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing it for almost 50 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I think one of the biggest
differences you see is the amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you've got fuzz over everything
and it's just roots on roots on roots on
[SPEAKER_07]: roots, you know, from the big ones to the
little tiny ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you pull the root out,
it takes a massive amount of soil with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really plugged into the
earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's clones from seeds there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even a bit more of a taproot with seeds,
but with clones, that's mostly the way I
[SPEAKER_07]: grew.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've done both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the coolest things I ever
did in our first hemp field in nineteen
[SPEAKER_02]: ninety five is I we were collecting a few
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled it out, just the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It pulled out pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a hemp plant, but it had a
nice long taproot on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up pulling out like five or
six of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they were laying on this trailer,
I was looking at the roots and on a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of them, the root, it went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was twisty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right at the bottom of the root
was the the husk of the the seed shell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could see the whole plant coming
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never seen that in my life prior to
nineteen ninety five in all the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we pulled up a few more and was like it
was fairly common.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to let Ethan maybe tell us
some, you know, a brief thing on how to
[SPEAKER_09]: use the roots, because it's an often
overlooked medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just really quickly before one of the
coolest things I've seen with roots is
[SPEAKER_09]: putting a crystal right underneath the
seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the whole entire plant grows
around the crystal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end of the year, you can pull
the plant up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like a staff and all the roots
have grown around the crystal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a friend do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what are some of the properties in
cannabis roots?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we use that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I became interested in this because a
lot of the old literature referred to
[SPEAKER_11]: medical use of the roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And typically the indications were to
treat inflammation and things like
[SPEAKER_11]: granulomas, fibrous tissues, and also for
cancer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interestingly, the chemical makeup of the
roots is totally different than what's in
[SPEAKER_11]: the tops, although oftentimes they're used
for the same things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the tops, as everybody knows,
we have cannabinoids and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the roots, in contrast, what we've got
are triterpenoids, which are actually the
[SPEAKER_11]: most abundant biochemicals in plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're well known for having a
protective effect on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for us, again, anti-inflammatory and
anti-cancer properties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're also alkaline.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also terloids in the roots,
which you don't find in the tops at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how you use them, a lot of people are
incorporating these into dermatological
[SPEAKER_11]: preparations.
[SPEAKER_11]: So very helpful for skin conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some people are cooking them and
eating the roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: We really know less about what the effects
are there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll just finish by saying I was
really surprised that some months ago I
[SPEAKER_11]: was in Santiago, Chile, and a guy was
selling cannabis products on the street.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them was a tincture of cannabis
roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this knowledge is spreading.
[SPEAKER_11]: Natasha Riz and I have an article that's,
I believe, available online on cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: roots.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also available on the DEMPureFarms
.com site.
[SPEAKER_09]: We posted it on there when you sent it to
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard about this before from the
roots and triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot, but it always made me
realize that it wouldn't surprise me if
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis had some powerful root systems,
particularly when back in the day when we
[SPEAKER_02]: learned about producing ayahuasca using a
plant containing tryptamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to try and find plants that had
the harminine and the harmaline that would
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of potentiate those tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we learned about Syrian roux,
which was sold at like Middle Eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: grocery stores in North Vancouver and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get this seed that you could
consume with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sort of like an ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we actually got like varula
verutis for the leaf from the DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got Banisteriopsis cappii root
bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for years, my friends and I had access
to this root bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember when we first met Acaridero
Shaman from Peru, from Iquitos.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was also a medical doctor, brilliant
man by the name of Jose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was tripping out that we had access
to the root bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, whoa, like the first 20 times
you only use like the smallest leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said there was sort of a buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only the hardcore shamans were doing
the root bark with their preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was actually kind of like he was blown
away and then actually kind of pissed off
[SPEAKER_02]: about it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, you guys shouldn't be doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be using a lesser.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to his effect, it was extremely
powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that had those concoctions were
just like that is something else.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Jamaica, root tonics are really
popular.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fermented root tonics are all over the
island.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every rasta makes a different,
not every, but just to say a lot of them
[SPEAKER_09]: make a lot of really great root tonics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And cannabis roots are often a part of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in Chinese herbal medicine,
traditional TCM, decoctions are made out
[SPEAKER_09]: of roots, alcohol decoctions.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like tinctures and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you get different properties
out of tincture extractions from roots
[SPEAKER_09]: than you would get out of say a liquid
extraction or an oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice to learn some of those
different compounds and know what your
[SPEAKER_09]: target is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to welcome Alex Rogers into the room
who just popped in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of tripped me out because from
the corner of my eye, you reminded me of
[SPEAKER_02]: Noel Van Shajak, who we got to like send
our love to the universe because amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis activists from Holland,
from Harlem, Willy Wartels, and just like
[SPEAKER_02]: did so much in Europe for the plant,
got arrested and escaped a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: authorities back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like super awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed away just recently, so we'll
have to send our regards and our love to
[SPEAKER_02]: his family and friends.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's cracking, Bobo?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cracking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got a whole crew in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a new platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about losing the coils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan Russo just gave the drop on roots
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragonfly Earth Medicines in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole bunch of cool folks in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, man, what's cracking with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back in Oregon right now at home in
Ashland.
[SPEAKER_05]: But where were you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in Europe the last couple of
months, so I was mainly in Slovenia where
[SPEAKER_05]: I stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife's Slovenian, so we're there a
couple of months out of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I travel all around Europe
because the conference is getting big
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get to write off a lot of my travel
expenses basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you'll be writing off a travel
expense to Vancouver here in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks, and we'll be seeing you
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be an awesome event in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really proud of what we built there,
and it's just a sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of my ICBC events are like in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 35% Germans, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Vancouver, it's like 80% of the
people come from BC, so it's become a real
[SPEAKER_05]: local BC show.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit different from most of
the shows that I go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really just do it in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, let's just get this over with,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have five days and five hotel
nights, and like, dude, let's just get
[SPEAKER_02]: this over with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started doing that in Oregon the one day
because everyone was like conference
[SPEAKER_05]: fatigue, and they're like, oh,
another conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, hmm, why don't we do it one
day?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also add the after parties that
you throw are actually worth going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie and Marley in that 40-person room in
Spain was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every now and blind hog finds an ear of
corn, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: We just keep pushing and get these little
gems popping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure any of you that are going to be
in and around Vancouver on the 16th of
[SPEAKER_02]: September, we'll be holding it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're at the Westin Bay Shores,
huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's adult venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right by Stanley Park, right on the-
I was just there for my daughter's
[SPEAKER_02]: graduation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proud of Papa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Proud of Papa, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like, was it Mugs?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got DJ Mugs from Cypress Hill doing the
after party on this giant yacht right
[SPEAKER_05]: outside the hotel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be super camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got John Sally coming, retired NBA
legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also got all the Canadian usual
suspects, all the bad asses, Jamie Shaw,
[SPEAKER_05]: John Conroy, guy named Marcus Richardson,
Chief Camdenoy Officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that title, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive my- I'm waiting for other people
to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a year since that title has been
in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm like, I saw Chief Ganja
Officer in Jamaica, which made me smile.
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't Pinsky use that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't Pinsky use that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Pinsky is also a Chief Canabinoid
Officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hate these titles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, man, I just want to make
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that too difficult?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what I'm looking forward
to with since starting Embark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been literally a year of jumping
through hoops and getting building permits
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting all of this stuff lined up so
that we can literally just do what-
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never been an industry like this
where it's just like, oh, you want to open
[SPEAKER_02]: up a business?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like binders of hoops to jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are flaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are spinning with acid flying
off of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every type of hoop you could possibly
fucking imagine jumping through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does show that only the most hard cores
are willing to push through with any of
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also say simultaneously,
it totally beats them kicking our doors
[SPEAKER_02]: down and arresting us in prison for 10
years at a time, shooting our dogs and
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking up our families and taking our
kids into child family protective
[SPEAKER_02]: services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have forgotten how shitty that
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's forgotten, bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's forgotten.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, I can put up with- I just
want to say that that's still happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still happening right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's happening in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's happening in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just heard a horrible story of a farm in
Santa Cruz that they put an eight-year-old
[SPEAKER_10]: and a nine-year-old on their belly with
guns to their heads and they didn't just
[SPEAKER_10]: take down their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They took down all of their greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_10]: They went in and ransacked their house.
[SPEAKER_10]: They took personal items.
[SPEAKER_10]: They even took their four-wheel drive
machines that they had and they drove them
[SPEAKER_10]: out into the woods and threw away the
keys.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not even having to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the authoritarian federal
government of the United States and civil
[SPEAKER_05]: forfeiture and all this added leeway they
get when they want to take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do whatever they want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to charge you and they can
take all your shit and that goes way
[SPEAKER_05]: beyond cannabis, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a straight-up civil liberty
issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the feds coming in like that,
it's always been a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know it's a problem or those who
know, know, but then the whole industry
[SPEAKER_05]: has become anesthetized from all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people on this call right
now, it's like we're the roots crew that's
[SPEAKER_05]: still reminding people that, hey,
we're here for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see the big Canadian finance guys come
into the room and how they talk and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not dissing any one group,
but all I'm saying is that this shit was
[SPEAKER_05]: built on the blood, sweat, and tears on
the backs of lives being ruined.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a great topic to bring up and
mention because I think most people are
[SPEAKER_05]: tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we do with the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first thing I said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the fucking government is going to
fuck everything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulators are going to mess
everything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's really important is that all
criminal penalties are ended towards
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and that everybody has the right
to a home garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go sell 10 pounds, the weed's not
the crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't pay your tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's always going to be a crime,
but that's a different crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: People could deal with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The weed, all the criminal penalties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used to be like, oh, it's like
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are like, oh, Jack,
that's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no, it's not, but that's never going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we can do to mitigate that is just
say, oh, let's keep ending the criminal
[SPEAKER_05]: penalties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The battle has just begun and everyone's
got to have their home garden around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Amish grow pretty good tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let those motherfuckers start growing some
weed and watch what happens.
[SPEAKER_16]: They do, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Amish have been growing weed for
years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been doing it for decades,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Masters of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone just pointed out, this is the
first church with 12 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were always limited to 10 people,
nine invitees and myself with the Google
[SPEAKER_02]: platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked me the other day,
they're like, how many people can you get
[SPEAKER_02]: in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, it says a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says I can put a hundred people in this
live chat with cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: How ridiculous is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Harm reduction club.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alex, we're up here in BC.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing amazing regenerative
agriculture and a ton of education.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to be involved in the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hit me up and we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The schedule for Vancouver is packed,
but maybe we could do some little few
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes, like get up rah rah and just make
everyone the fuck aware of what the hell
[SPEAKER_05]: is going on and why we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hit me up and we'll do something.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we definitely will.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely have to get there too.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I got a question for Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question for Dr. Russo,
if I could.
[SPEAKER_16]: Ethan, do you know like what the latest
and greatest is on the FDA's position on
[SPEAKER_16]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have any update on that at all?
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the situation is with the farm bill,
the hemp bill, supposedly a lot of these
[SPEAKER_11]: preparations with less than 0.2% THC are
legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, that is not the position of the
Food and Drug Administration or the DEA.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So from the position of the FDA,
the preparation Epidiolex, which is 98%
[SPEAKER_11]: pure CBD is a schedule five substance.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the lowest level of control.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that only applies to Epidiolex,
and it does not apply to any other form of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabidiol, which remains in schedule
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd point out that cannabidiol has not
been scheduled in most countries,
[SPEAKER_11]: extra USA.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the DEA, it's again, to them,
it's all illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they will tell you they reserve the
right to arrest anybody engaged in this
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of commerce.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's great that we've made progress in
the states, however, and no one should
[SPEAKER_11]: suffer the illusion that it couldn't all
disappear tomorrow if the political will
[SPEAKER_11]: were there to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, it would be a stupid idea and
contrary to everything that we'd like to
[SPEAKER_11]: have happen, but that is still possible
because of these discrepancies in the law
[SPEAKER_11]: and what the administrations feel the
situation still is.
[SPEAKER_16]: Couldn't there be an exception to that
rule, though, if the Department of the
[SPEAKER_16]: Secretary of the Health and Human Services
issues an exception to the FD&C Act to put
[SPEAKER_16]: CBD into foods and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_16]: So isn't there always that loophole that
it is just really up to one person in the
[SPEAKER_16]: Trump administration right now?
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the person is an acting HHS
secretary.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even think it's a fully
Senate-appointed one.
[SPEAKER_16]: But isn't it just true that there is a
loophole for an exception to that law?
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as that goes, the truth doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the semblance of truth that you can
create.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they will bury anyone under a tangle
of legal fees to make their point.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wouldn't count on that at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: The attorney general could do something if
he were so inclined.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hold your breath.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we really need is Congress to tackle
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are available bills that are
just not moving at this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the potential is clearly there for this
to be rectified.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: And really, to change the laws,
we really need change in the Senate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think Mitch McConnell,
even though he's so-called pro-HEM,
[SPEAKER_16]: is dead Senate advance-moving any cannabis
legislation to the floor for vote.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he just needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: True that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there was a question that I missed
like three times now from Kenna Biss in
[SPEAKER_02]: the chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to know if anyone knew
anything about cannabis hypermesis
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have another hour?
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a real syndrome.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not someone's imagination.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not related to me, as you will hear
in some quarters.
[SPEAKER_11]: This only occurs in people who do very
heavy chronic doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know precisely.
[SPEAKER_11]: But my theories on this would be one of
two things.
[SPEAKER_11]: One is that we're seeing an expression of
the biphasic effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's well known that cannabinoids can have
opposite effects at different dose ranges.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it may be that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it may be that what usually treats
nausea produces nausea and vomiting at
[SPEAKER_11]: these elevated doses.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, the THC is still
lowering the set point in the hypothalamus
[SPEAKER_11]: and producing hypothermia, which explains
the hot bathing phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that could be happening is
because of chronic exposure to THC,
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're getting a down regulation of
the CB1 receptors in the brain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this will cause a change in the way
that THC acts.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will become an antagonist at the
receptor instead of an agonist.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will reverse the normal state of
affairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: The solution to cannabinoid hypermesis,
which produces the vomiting, nausea,
[SPEAKER_11]: abdominal pain, and this bathing behavior,
the solution is abstention from cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people will get better.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, most will suffer a recurrence if
they go back to their prior use patterns.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the solution is twofold.
[SPEAKER_11]: One is use the lowest dose that produces
the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think that cannabidiol may be
protective.
[SPEAKER_11]: So certainly people should be using type 2
or even type 3 cannabis preparations with
[SPEAKER_11]: a good quota of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ethan, does this happen to people who
eat cannabis or only smoke it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there aren't that many people that
are ingesting THC type cannabis orally.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just not sure that generally we're
seeing it with people that are smoking and
[SPEAKER_11]: especially doing vapes all day long.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the cannabis concentrate seem to be
strongly associated with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be something else going on,
obviously, because there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: who use a lot of THC daily that don't get
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting to find what needs
to be lined up for this to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are saying, oh, why does he say it
couldn't be neem?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could be neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard the argument as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's not a huge leap of faith for
me to think that a substance like cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that works through the endocannabinoid
system and creates all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: effects and regulates all these biological
functions, that there couldn't be systems
[SPEAKER_02]: where it flips, where just something's
happening in the system and it's getting
[SPEAKER_02]: it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, I've seen enough people
back in the day take a big hit of bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash for the first time and literally
either go white and pass out or turn green
[SPEAKER_02]: and throw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that I saw a multitude of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for my own self, have I ever taken a
big enough rip that I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to puke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely at Skunk Man Sam's house,
I felt that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guilty for being.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I have a theory on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really can't share at this point,
but I think in the future, we may be able
[SPEAKER_11]: to identify people who are at risk of
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Syndrome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as they say, watch the space we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really like to find a single
person that gets it from orally eating too
[SPEAKER_07]: much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, generally, it's been association
with with high intake of smoked high THC
[SPEAKER_11]: material.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's actually a couple
different things that are creating this
[SPEAKER_12]: hypermesis and it being a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have obviously on the previous hash
churches, we discussed potential risks
[SPEAKER_12]: associated with pesticide contamination.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some labs or some products being
consumed in the Midwest and non non
[SPEAKER_12]: regulated states that could that are
exhibiting signs of pesticide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_12]: But with cannabis hypermesis syndrome,
I think it's just a super saturation
[SPEAKER_12]: within the CB1 receptors, because a lot of
the patients that are exhibiting it are
[SPEAKER_12]: consuming more greater amount of
cannabinoids than previously available in
[SPEAKER_12]: the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you think in terms of the
conversion of Delta 9, when you ingest
[SPEAKER_14]: something, there's something to that,
you know, would you also believe that we
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I say to myself all the time,
we need to better understand what happens
[SPEAKER_14]: inside the body to the on the conversion.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to hear if anyone has
actually done any studies or looked into
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I could address this again.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's still a bit of a
controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were experiments done by Leo
Hollister back in the 70s on that alleged
[SPEAKER_11]: that 11 hydroxy THC, which is what THC
gets converted to in the liver on the
[SPEAKER_11]: first pass that that was four to 10 times
more psychoactive than THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, there was a lot of work at GW on
Sativex.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of this was not published.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the bottom line was, they looked at
THC levels in the blood, 11 hydroxy THC
[SPEAKER_11]: levels in the blood, and had patients talk
about how high they were on a hundred
[SPEAKER_11]: point scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were just no good correlations
that showed that there seemed to be any
[SPEAKER_11]: difference in the psychoactivity of THC
and 11 hydroxy THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is not a settled issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the experiments that you
need to do to prove this would involve
[SPEAKER_11]: putting a radioactive label on the
molecules and injecting them
[SPEAKER_11]: intravenously.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're going to have trouble
getting that through an ethics committee.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure this is one we can settle.
[SPEAKER_11]: But bottom line is, it's unclear that
there's a big difference in the
[SPEAKER_11]: psychoactive effects of THC and 11
hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to add one really quick
thing is that I'm seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: misdiagnosis with this as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So doctors who don't necessarily have the
education, they'll ask the patient,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they'll just give a diagnosis of
that when the person is actually having a
[SPEAKER_10]: gallbladder attack or something that is
showing the same symptoms.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe that, you know, pushing this
education forward so more clinicians and
[SPEAKER_10]: people and physicians have an educated,
you know, knowing of what the symptoms are
[SPEAKER_10]: and how to test for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a friend who has the issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when, you know, they smoke our
cannabis, she doesn't have it at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, I don't mean I'm not going to
say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I going to make a statement on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's got to be righteous,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who can smoke cannabis,
but if she smokes hash, she passes out
[SPEAKER_02]: unconscious, like very badly, like to the
to the point where she knocked out teeth
[SPEAKER_02]: the last time and we don't even let her
smoke it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the like not even sitting down.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's falling out of chairs like I just
wanted to mention to Ethan that we have
[SPEAKER_16]: received approval to do a radio labeled
study of our hydrogenated cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_16]: through internasal delivery.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was an arduous process, but we were
finally there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're at the front end of basically
commissioning a study to look at
[SPEAKER_16]: internasal delivery using radioactivity
just as a way to follow how it goes into
[SPEAKER_16]: the animal's brain.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's animals on this one feedback on the
psychoactive levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: And unless we've got a rodent whisperer
out there, I don't know that we're going
[SPEAKER_11]: to get full answers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Animals first, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Animals first.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bat phone is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Batman was in the room,
but Batman.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry about that, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Dr. Batman to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the bat, the bat phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be sorry whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash church was a little intense in
the beginning as we were doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single Sunday from wherever I was in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I built this incredible, like it was,
it was stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even saying going to say how
stressful it was, but now it's nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have a dialogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great that everyone was able to come
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I was going to do two hours today
and we are at two hours and one minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as always, let me just change the
screen so everyone can be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice way to go through things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can thank everyone for coming and yeah,
if anyone wants to say anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, there's a really cool function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we're going to use it now,
but for future references, there's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a function where you can like put
your hand up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's, it's a little like thing
on the box where it says, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if someone's saying something
and you want to chime in rather than four
[SPEAKER_02]: people all talk at once, you know,
you can put your hands up and create an
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll try that next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank everyone for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even last minute, Alex, I'll see you at
ICBC in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: D420K and Johnny B, Mr. Wade Laughter and
Dutch Blooms, Colton Turner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, dude, for coming and hanging
out with us as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to have you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin and Michael, Mike West.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that is there from the dragon fly
earth medicine, Josh and Kelly and Nishi
[SPEAKER_02]: and, Ethan, thank you all for coming and
chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunkman Sam as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys next time on hash
church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone have a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye everybody.
