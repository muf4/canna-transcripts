[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, boating with Flav.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we roll, Flav?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is how we roll.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boating with Pelican cases.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, how's it going, Wolf?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we just came out of the little shop
and fucking Flav is still got this jet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's great, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, let's hit the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful day on the dock.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my boat's just been sitting there for
the last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: There she blows.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna take that out and go have some
fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can go look for some... Oh,
I just saw a big splash out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what that was, but could have
easily been a dolphin or a seal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably a seal, more likely than
anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get on this bad boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Need
[SPEAKER_10]: a hand?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do this first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's pull the boat in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to leave it on a long line so it
sits off the dock all night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that is usually a good idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marshall 2000, we get the big end.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, don't untie it yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're tying your shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, don't untie it yet, Dave.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have to pull it in again,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we're not sure where we're
gonna go on this little adventure,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we're gonna pack up this boat and head
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are in Zivata.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful sunny day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boat bound, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got fat glass with us, is that what
I'm to understand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, we got a couple of pieces from
earlier today that we thought,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they got some water creatures on
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought maybe they should be in the
ocean with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcel Braun pieces out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a special day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got... Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks so sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks even more beautiful out on the
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, and it's with us, coming out with us
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know, where do you want to
head, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to head over to the islands?
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to head to Gambier?
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to head to Boyer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Really easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boyer would be good, or Gambier would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the back end of Gambier.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go to Hawket Bay right across
the way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, you got that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to put them back away?
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's got its own table.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need to get some water and we can
pump out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as we can move in the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we can go.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's good to go, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everything else is good to go?
[SPEAKER_10]: Back a few notches.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the boat with the glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're going to head over to Gambier.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, of course, you guys are coming
with us, so let's get on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we've got to a little set of
islands here deep in the Howe Sound,
[SPEAKER_09]: just in front of the back end of Gambier,
up in the north end, where Anvil Island
[SPEAKER_10]: and Diamond Head are towards Whistler.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see this little island is just
teeming with happy little life.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got birds.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got seals.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're chill.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubble man's world nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hard to hold the camera steady and give
them a good show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're just going to go around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you'll be packing bowls real soon
is what I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here we are amongst the seals and
the mountains and the ocean and the
[SPEAKER_10]: Flavinators loading fat glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shall I kill the boat?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seems like as good as any to blow by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's let the current take us where
it will.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to take us over to Bird Island
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure if I want to go around
the back of Gambier and take us all the
[SPEAKER_10]: way around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back over and head over and hit
another bowl at Bowen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another one like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll go to Hawkeye Bay then.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're hitting a bowl here though.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's time to start this session
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the Marcel, the octopus just
looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: The seals and the sea birds in the
background.
[SPEAKER_10]: So good.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a little bit of a dirty window.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are probably picking up on
through the sun, but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Long skill in the sucking and the lighting
skill of the main line because I'll tell
[SPEAKER_10]: you, we're out in the middle of the ocean
and it's super windy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotcha.
[SPEAKER_10]: Champion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's still lit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I'm not sure I've ever hit a piece
that heady on a boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just being honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really don't know if I hit one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, I'll help with my hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've hit the Marcel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're either going to head over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's head over to Hawkeye Bay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we were going to head
originally.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to just the inside of the bay
there and turn a little session in there
[SPEAKER_10]: so dolphins go in there and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And go through the straight all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's a quick boot right across to
Bowen Island and on our way back,
[SPEAKER_09]: we can hit a boyar.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Hawkeye Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go puff it?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be marked in this bay.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you feeling with the Phoenix?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it looks so good on the boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just unique.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't always take these pieces out like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're pushing boundaries here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're taking the piece to a place that's
of equivalent beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is where we're going to hit
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is a really, really,
really, really, really nice application.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is real, real sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a beautiful island.
[SPEAKER_10]: Real sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Hawkeye Bay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're like on rocks, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say we're eight feet away.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just about fucked the dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pulling in pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time's coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see that it's already reaching some
point.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be puffing, and it's going
to take a little while.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I'm going to have to pull out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe where we just were,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it would have been brought my vibe
down large, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not about killing your high.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not fucking around either,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I recorded all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, we'll start it over so I don't have
to see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you guys missed that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I pulled us up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I set everything up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we were like literally eight feet
from the rocks, the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: The wind is blowing in pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we're going to have this quick
session.
[SPEAKER_10]: You require hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wind's just turning the boat all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's turning it around.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bringing us back to our rocks that
we were on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's quite a bit of hash in this bowl
already.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a boat whipping up on the back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, we're licensed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the operator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we take a nice long break in between
rips.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like we're ripping around all
stoned.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, well, well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not inconsiderate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I find that cannabis makes me more aware.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm less likely to want to do anything
like drive or operate any type of heavy
[SPEAKER_10]: machinery when I just don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just want to sit around for like an
hour?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just move to another position.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's much nicer to just sort of sit
here for an hour after every rip and
[SPEAKER_06]: listen to music in the sunshine.
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as we don't peel into the rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sit there for too long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiny little hawk at bay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got one other visitor that just rolled
in and they're just a couple.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like they also have a Marcel custom
piece in their boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the J.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lee Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're just like, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm from America.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: We got the J.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lee Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're wearing a Marcel shirt.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're like, we've got the Marcel
Phoenix and we have a J.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lee shirt on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I think, I don't think it's
anything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's that my positioning,
I feel pretty good about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the sense that just this one little
zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get you a big old flame.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm not confident even with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we try to clean it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for the try to clean out hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice Terpy hit though, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, super true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice Terpy hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect flame placement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on the hashish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beeline.
[SPEAKER_10]: Slowly unwinding and wrap it back up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boat terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secured the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, always secured, always secured.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, we don't get out on the
boat often enough, do we?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take a boat often, but not always to the
danger of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're blowing in pretty close.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to probably move.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the wind's taking us a good like
60 feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once it gets you sideways and you're on
the wave banks, you're done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just since you turned the boat off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're good though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to chill here in Hawkeye
Bay for a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we're going to find ourselves another
spot to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just driving.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been making our way, I guess,
what would you call this?
[SPEAKER_10]: The straight?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: The straight between the straight.
[SPEAKER_10]: The straight between the straight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this attaches West Vancouver,
the water to the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can escape out through the
back end there, which is Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess Paisley and some other islands
are back there as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there is where we came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: See my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's start that over again.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this house is an island on an island.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's separated only by a small little area
and the land is just right under that
[SPEAKER_10]: water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that water goes into a cave.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see that, Dave?
[SPEAKER_10]: The cave.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's his driveway.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how he gets onto his island where
he has his home and his windmill.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is pretty effing cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I'd show you guys that.
[SPEAKER_10]: How baller is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Bowen Island on our right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Vancouver Island in the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back around Hot Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: See a big boat cruise, probably one of the
ones from Holland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge love boat type thingy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Horseshoe Bay is right over there
where the ferries come in from Vancouver
[SPEAKER_10]: Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of sailboats out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to rip around this corner and
pull into the Bowen Island Marina.
[SPEAKER_09]: Government dock there that I can pull up
on and more to.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Flavs steer us into Bowen Island Marina
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a ferry that comes in here
once every hour, hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a real nice little zone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always quiet in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can kayak in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can hit rips in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have the lighter on, Flavie?
[SPEAKER_10]: Lighter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should have the... I got the
beeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got the beeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, if I pull this off, this would be one
of my favorite hits of the year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The setting, setting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be my favorite hit of
the year, Flav.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm happy to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government dock is right in front of
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That big long dock.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to come take a front yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Phoenix in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do it, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll slow down if I have to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got real lucky.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just doing a little photo shoot
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the pieces set up on the pelican
and we've got the mountain range in the
[SPEAKER_10]: background.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're kind of doing these little sort
of showpiece.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, here's the fish 2000 piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: Piece on Bowen Island, right on the ocean,
Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for my shadow there, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really beautiful, epic, historical piece
in any aspect of how you look at glass in
[SPEAKER_10]: the last 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's the man with his glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well that was fish 2000 in the
photo shoot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was real fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to head off Bowen now and
we're going to head over to this island
[SPEAKER_10]: over there, Boyer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't even really say hi to Bowen too
much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Small little marina.
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple of nice size boats there,
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is where the ferry comes in to
Snug Cove.
[SPEAKER_10]: But more on that later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Packing them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how the Phoenix is just sitting on
the back of the boat in the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love everything about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we should have a quick rip here at
the dock.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you feeling like ripping?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need water for this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's use that guy.
OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Might as well start with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right in the sun star again.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is some D420K OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You ought to be kidding me with this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need the lighter?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, you had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's got a memory.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's saying, yep, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, is it nice to be on the dock and
chilling though, hey?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not having the wind blow out your
beeline every half second.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bub rips on boats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make a puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression The purpose of the weed let I
[SPEAKER_01]: view the time The weed is not here to
trick the mind It is only here to do it's
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose of time Ganja is not here to trick
the mind It is only here to do it's
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose of time Well I imagine down the
road there'll be some cops Setting up them
[SPEAKER_01]: plat and scheme and all the wrecking all
the weed traps But you man a rass Man weed
[SPEAKER_01]: rems, don't rems and tell me how few rems
I'm fast at Up on the scene, 2 pound
[SPEAKER_01]: intervene In my brain, stay that keen And
behind the scene, me and my team Have
[SPEAKER_01]: another 25 pound, if you come in they'll
be smoke it half clean Man I ice now Up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene, 2 pound intervene In my brain,
stay that keen And behind the scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: me and my team Have another 25 pound,
if you come in they'll be smoke it half
[SPEAKER_10]: clean Up on the scene, 2 pound intervene
It's a very active nature zone I've even
[SPEAKER_10]: seen this wall right here when the water
goes down Full of purple starfish Like a
[SPEAKER_10]: thousand of them So it's a really really
beautiful area It's just you know the
[SPEAKER_10]: different type of trees The juniper and
the Douglas fir and the arbutus It's just
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful What more can you say really
Other than maybe we should hit a beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: glass pipe With some really nice hash In
the setting of this island What do you
[SPEAKER_10]: think?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably a good idea Glass shaking
his head up and down, yeah I would have to
[SPEAKER_10]: say that's a pretty good idea We're going
to go around the back of this island and
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll hit it then Alright So you were
saying about Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're going to be taking a lot of fat
glass to Amsterdam We're going to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of really really melty hash A lot of
really nice dry sift And even today
[SPEAKER_10]: whether it happens or not One of the ideas
I put forward to Craig Greg, sorry And
[SPEAKER_10]: yourself was that we would shoot some of
the glass that would be in the gallery
[SPEAKER_10]: show And that we would Is that my phone?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that we would take some really
beautiful photos of the pieces in nature
[SPEAKER_10]: in these sort of settings You know high
end photos Print them G clay prints you
[SPEAKER_10]: know not too too big but not too small And
then do a gallery show with like I don't
[SPEAKER_10]: know if you're doing a half a dozen or a
dozen pieces or ten pieces or what it is
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I think it would be somewhere between
there But you know and then have a picture
[SPEAKER_10]: for each one that's hanging in the gallery
Maybe the piece isn't for sale Maybe it's
[SPEAKER_10]: for sale but you can't afford it The
picture might be And it would be a nice
[SPEAKER_10]: collab too if you bought yourself a piece
like that With an awesome photo in it Oh I
[SPEAKER_06]: would love some nice photos of these guys
Absolutely As my photography skills are
[SPEAKER_06]: not that good That's alright Hit it I'm
going to hit it Hit it Oh actually I
[SPEAKER_10]: already put something Let's go hit it in
the front of the boat Perfect end to a
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful day my friend Really really
really this is awesome Boyer Island right
[SPEAKER_10]: behind us We've got the mainland attached
to Vancouver over there Anvil in the
[SPEAKER_10]: background Tantalus range way in the
background those sharp edgy kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: mountains I haven't saw black tusk earlier
it was so clear when we were going out
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be the last one Did we hit fish
2000?
[SPEAKER_06]: No they never even put water in it But she
came out for the ride
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta hit it We'll need to put some
water in it We'll do it Do that right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so I mean why wait?
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we in the back there from the
island?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh we're good We're like 50 yards
Beautiful Five at the very least What did
[SPEAKER_06]: I do with that shit?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Had a bottle of water Oh it's okay We have
a liter of water in this thing so Yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: true If you were missing water we could
definitely sort it out And then we're
[SPEAKER_10]: floating on Oh geez I don't know what do
you think 800 trillion metric tons or
[SPEAKER_10]: something?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah We're slowly getting seemingly pulled
back As we get closer we're getting pulled
[SPEAKER_10]: in faster We are hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can move it forward a bit
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah we're good We're good This is
actually a good part of the island It's
[SPEAKER_10]: fairly deep right here It's just a sheer
cliff Just like that Thanks brother Sorry
[SPEAKER_10]: to be a pain in the butt Oh dude But it's
fish 2000 For fish 2000 I'll be a pain in
[SPEAKER_10]: the butt bro
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean come on
[SPEAKER_10]: So happy You know I've spent time actually
with Marcel In this sound on kayaks over
[SPEAKER_10]: the years He used to come up and we'd
chill out He was one of the people One of
[SPEAKER_10]: the few people actually that would come
out on the kayaks
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I hit the last one?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well it does because we're looking for the
lighter I did Oh yes Oh actually you know
[SPEAKER_10]: what you did hit it but I let the key line
There it is Yeah because I felt like I
[SPEAKER_10]: just literally took a hit There's a seal
right there Yep just chilling in the water
[SPEAKER_10]: look at that Awesome Yeah man it is the
beauty of the day I mean honestly in this
[SPEAKER_10]: moment really for me the only way to make
it you know a slight bit better would be
[SPEAKER_10]: to see the pod of killer whales or the pod
of dolphins come in Not even to hang out
[SPEAKER_10]: for long even if they just ripped by out
it would just be like So for those of you
[SPEAKER_10]: that don't live here but that might want
to have this experience You can go to
[SPEAKER_10]: Horseshoe Bay There's a place called
Sewell's Marina S-E-W-A-L-L-S and Sewell's
[SPEAKER_10]: Marina rents these little boats and
they're perfect for the job of getting out
[SPEAKER_10]: on the house sound ripping around to all
the spots that Flav and I just hit today
[SPEAKER_10]: There's maps on the boat that shows you
specific names and where you're going and
[SPEAKER_10]: it's a very easy sound to not get lost in
I would only say that it isn't a lake
[SPEAKER_10]: there's tons of dead heads and trees and
you can really muck up your boat if you
[SPEAKER_10]: don't pay attention But what have we been
out on the water for two hours?
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on that's good Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were on Gambier.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were over by Anvil and the islands We
were on Bowen.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't stop like we did it only
takes you like 30 minutes to do it all
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, exactly the real the real fun
is in the stopping Wow
[SPEAKER_10]: look at that It's lit All right,
so you ready for your 90 micron?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just floating a perfect little spot
here fish 2000 In the sunlight the color
[SPEAKER_06]: the all the different colors of the dichro
you just pop Yeah, they really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do
[SPEAKER_10]: It almost feels like we're anchored the
way we're just sitting in the perfect zone
[SPEAKER_10]: We pretty much just stopped and this is a
beautiful panoramic vista.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah What's going on which we're gonna
share right after Flav takes his rip
[SPEAKER_10]: because this is the last rip of this
particular session It's been an absolutely
[SPEAKER_10]: wonderful puff Wednesday.
