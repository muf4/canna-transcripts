[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am on my way to Remo's place this
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite excited, always excited to go see
Remo, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just at the end of another great run,
and today we're mostly excited to go see
[SPEAKER_02]: this incredible Congo that he's got for us
to photograph today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically going down with my macro
gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go and shoot whatever strains
he's got left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly I'm really going to shoot this
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the one that we're excited to
see today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's apparently, you know, seven to ten
feet tall, as many of Remo's plants are in
[SPEAKER_02]: this last run, if you saw the teaser video
that I showed you recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 6.30 in the morning, pretty bright
for 6.30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my Method 7 HPS's on, because I'll
tell ya, I get wicked headaches
[SPEAKER_02]: photographing under those HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't take long, about an hour,
an hour and a half in, and I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good size headache, so these will
eliminate that opportunity, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: today actually we're not just filming a
video over at Remo's, but I got some other
[SPEAKER_02]: special stuff planned for us as well,
so I won't ruin the surprise now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you'll see more about that later
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'll see you when we get to Remo's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi mountains of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep valleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flat surface of the world.
People livin', they're livin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_03]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goes by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn your starter on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get your engine in gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And leave the stagnant waters,
waters behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just leave the stagnant, stagnant waters
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: A rocker's music.
[SPEAKER_03]: A rocker's music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seek new horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: New horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seek new horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: New horizons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just here, I am over at Remo, the Urban
Growers, and I'm about to start doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: macro photography, but I figured before I
did, I'd walk you through the room real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Remo's just coming to do some
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Girl Scout cookies from
Camp Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks nothing like any Girl Scout
cookies I've ever seen, but wow is it
[SPEAKER_02]: dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is unbelievably dank, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you guys have heard me go on and on
and on every time I come into this room,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's slightly exciting to say the least.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see quite a bit of a difference on
the two sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between this one and that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff full of bud we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got the right color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit hard sometimes to get
the right color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it is completely insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the date today?
[SPEAKER_02]: The date is, oh I can do this,
it is the 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that because it was my
daughter's birthday yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, is this a rock star?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this is the chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I can't wait to photograph this,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rock star is just white.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is trichome farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of the strongest shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can tell the resin just looks
completely insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock star, chemo's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's trichome city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trichome city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remo brand nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you, I never ever ever get sick
of coming into this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like basically heaven for a
person that is passionate and in love with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis the way I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely have a passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been involved in the industry for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue cheese, I thought that was blue
cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did this one come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice color on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sort of bluey purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green pastures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seek new horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: New horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seek new horizons.
New horizons.
[SPEAKER_03]: For new, just new, new and greener
pastures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music can change your mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music can lift you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music can change your mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music can lift you higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Refresh yourself now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaner.
Cleaner, cleaner waters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaner waters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listening to the music of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to listen to the message in the
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it rock you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocker's music.
Let it rock you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big old rock star right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: About seven foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another rock star over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's tranquility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a nice word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how often do you hand water these bad
boys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day hand watered and all the water's
coming out of your?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all reclaimed from my chemo fires and
my AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Reclaimed water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water from his dehumidifier and his AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a 55 gallon drum in the corner
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many tons is that system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many tons is your air conditioning?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a five ton and a four ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're full of five tons of cooling in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five ton and a four ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A total of nine tons of cooling in this
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you need when you want to
step your game up to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not joking, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an unbelievably crystal-y plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really surprised at the quality of the
resins growing all the way down the fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big fat Girl Scout cookies bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course these ridiculous
monsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what were these two again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Girl Scout as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a very different phenyl from
the one over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fox tailing out a little bit or just
bigger buds.
Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones just seem to have buds the size
of your forearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's basically as big as your
forearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit, the lower ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this one is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven and a half weeks here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a veg of what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says he usually likes to go for two
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these plants are a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in a sense they are, but my
goodness, they're a real nice small plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the things that I've always
been impressed with about Ramo and his
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to grow is that he always
constantly takes in strains and genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: from many different companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not one to shy away from cracking
some seeds and finding a phenyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll usually do a version of it that
is at least as good as the best version
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've ever seen, if it's got the
ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, of course, Ramo received the
Congolese a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that he likes the strong,
heavy hitting action of an indica for his
[SPEAKER_02]: pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just felt like the Congo could use a
place in his garden that he would
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate the uniqueness of the exotic
smoke that it had to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's apparently got a monster
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the biggest Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, the biggest Congo you've ever
seen in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, so you guys didn't even see that,
but I basically just picked up this bud
[SPEAKER_02]: that is like, I don't know, an ounce or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just hanging down like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ, Ramo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, that is going to be all over my
camera now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else can we show you guys here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to see this water reclaim system
that he's pulling his water out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be careful in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: UBC?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a rock star.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the white OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little white OG for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: White OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to a absolutely stunning rock star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I am just picking any top to show you
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you an idea, every single top is
damn near perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: No bugs, no mildews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, it is beyond impressive
when you have a grow of this stature,
[SPEAKER_02]: of this quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like a machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He rolls it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like he rolls it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He rolls it out almost as fast as he rolls
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that every once in a while Ramo,
even himself, potentially runs out of
[SPEAKER_02]: herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the importance of allowing
Canadian citizens to be able to grow our
[SPEAKER_02]: own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine the cost to Ramo if he had
to buy this much medicine for his head?
[SPEAKER_02]: He smokes an enormous amount of cannabis
for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have to buy this cannabis for $10
to $12 a gram would be completely
[SPEAKER_02]: astronomical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even imagine how much it would
cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got all his names written down on the
bottoms of the cans, garbage cans.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you an idea of the size of the
stalks that he grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramo's lower buds on the bottom of his
stalks are bigger than some people's
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think I'm gonna get to it,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna pull out the macro lens and take
a bunch of pictures for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: hours because I know you guys love to
check out the macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll have a nice long slideshow
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And judging by what I can see just with my
naked eye, I'm pretty excited about the
[SPEAKER_02]: prospects of photographing this room here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So catch up with you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true the kind of real cloudy like I
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like being back with me baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we come together for one life,
we're coming from behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's turn, let's turn the tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I and I come to turn the tables.
Turn the paradigm around.
Yes, deprogram and reprogram.
Free mankind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mindset of the people, children.
[SPEAKER_03]: True to children seeking for the via,
the way, the path.
[SPEAKER_03]: I and I come to freedom, freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a light in the candle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing the world our watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trotting forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing the world our watch.
Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trotting forward at this time.
Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
Spiritual warriors are on a mission.
Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
Spiritual warriors trotting from behind.
