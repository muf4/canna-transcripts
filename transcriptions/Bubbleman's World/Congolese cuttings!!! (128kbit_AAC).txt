[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take the Congolese cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite excited about this, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just waiting for as long as I did to
acquire this strain and I've had it just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks and now I'm already able
to take a clone or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a couple of pucks prepared
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my Remos roots, rooting gel in
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got my Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're going to go right from
the top here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little scissor trick with a little bit
of gel on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we're going to come in here at an
angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a nice little dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find it its new home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: One Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I do indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that felt great to take a couple of
Congolese clones and I'll keep you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: updated on to how long it takes them to
root and hopefully we'll be able to give
[SPEAKER_02]: at least one of them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
Thanks for watching.
