[SPEAKER_01]: fingers crossed yeah what's going on
everybody welcome welcome to the wake and
[SPEAKER_01]: bake episode 76 I wasn't sure it was gonna
work you know just made it down I've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty busy morning here but I never
forget about my wake and bake crew welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter s so I figured I'd get out on the
boat the water is like glass right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we would just have a beautiful
little afternoon wake and bake if you will
[SPEAKER_01]: now I got my little mothership here I did
forget the water which is kind of funny
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're sitting on a body of water and
you have no water even kind of funnier
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're sitting on a bottle body of
ocean water and you have no water and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thirsty that's not the case for me
but today we will be hitting the piece dry
[SPEAKER_01]: as I totally spaced bringing any water and
let's see what else I spaced bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always a few other things that I
space hey what's going on can of stone
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody oh yeah all right get the dab
ease should be good here should be good
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah salt water don't want to be putting
that in the well Brett it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up pretty good for me I'm not on
the internet I'm using my phone and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not using Wi-Fi at all I'm using my
carrier service and I have four bars so
[SPEAKER_01]: you might want to come back and watch it
pre-recorded and it should come in really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice then my connection is showing pretty
solid right now so I say it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: awake and bake all right love the boat
vids yeah the boat vids are sweet I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: it is just fucking heavenly out here right
now if you can kind of catch a glimpse
[SPEAKER_01]: really beautiful mountains across the way
we got we got the Sunshine Coast Gambier
[SPEAKER_01]: Anvil Island over to the right with the
whole top blown off of course that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dormant volcano that blew many many many
many years ago and over in that direction
[SPEAKER_01]: we have Horseshoe Bay we got the Sunshine
Coast we got Vancouver Island West
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver and my own little village of
Lions Bay the Lions are cool because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can always see that's the Lions right up
there in the snow you see those two little
[SPEAKER_01]: peaks it gently rocking in the boat you
know we just rocking it rocking it good
[SPEAKER_01]: out on the water thought you were in a hot
air balloon oh fuck I got to do it I gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: do a hot air balloon now that's just so
cool the Lions of Judah indeed what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: water temp oh I would say cold maybe 60
degrees you know not enough not warm
[SPEAKER_01]: enough yet we go in it we go in it it
happens all day long we get out there on
[SPEAKER_01]: the wake skate on the wakeboard on the
wake surf on the skis the knee boards the
[SPEAKER_01]: tube it's all happening in the meantime I
think it's time to get this bowl out and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a little dab what say you you can use
the torch for the balloon to heat your
[SPEAKER_00]: banger dude that's fucking awesome I agree
I think we're gonna have to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: happening much love bud rich much love
everyone I hope you're all having a great
[SPEAKER_01]: day today I'm just gonna do a nice little
calm wake and bake after I clean my dabber
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you here's a pet peeve of mine
the dabber never gets cleaned properly
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody cleans off the dabber when they
take their rip and so at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: session once I've already dolloped out you
know a dozen or so rips I find that my
[SPEAKER_01]: dabber needs to get put away and brought
somewhere and then generally I put it
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere stupid get fibers all over it
and have to do the old clean with your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers mentality which is fine until you
get transfer until I start sticking my
[SPEAKER_01]: hands everywhere and then I the whole
boats full of full of resin which is clean
[SPEAKER_01]: before and after I like yeah me too tough
puffing but I don't when I'm puffing with
[SPEAKER_01]: like five or six other people and then I
feel like why the fuck should I be taking
[SPEAKER_01]: care of all these motherfuckers well now I
know because I get the sticky fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: first world problems not gonna complain
too hard about it in fact I'm not really
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna complain at all it's just mostly
conversation don't get it on your elbows
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you do agreed dude agreed octo
all right so we're gonna have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: dabby doodles here a couple of different
kinds on the little of that lemon Larry OG
[SPEAKER_01]: see if we can get it off the parchment
it's not actually parchment it's DTFE oil
[SPEAKER_01]: slick all right so we'll get that down
there and then them I'd hope you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: well today oh we got to do a turp dip we
got to do a turp dip I mean we can do a
[SPEAKER_01]: turp dip can't we I am going in for some
stardog star dog right there little
[SPEAKER_01]: stardog turps fuck yeah ordered some press
heady bags there you go off to octo Tom I
[SPEAKER_01]: like that play on the words press head
pressure press headies we should name them
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's a really good really good name
all right so let's start this way can bake
[SPEAKER_01]: properly I'll probably give something away
on this way can bake but you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: think have you burnt your forearm on your
nail oh I've burnt my forearm on my nail
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it happened I'm not gonna lie it
happened still got the the mark right here
[SPEAKER_01]: you know leaning over the nail that was
quite a while ago but it does happen do
[SPEAKER_01]: you go fishing I'm not a huge fisherman
but I have friends who are big into
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing and I enjoy going with them and
enjoying their sort of experience I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: as stoked on on pulling a fish out of the
water as they are but I love going with
[SPEAKER_01]: them I love the excitement and I keep the
bowls flowing let's just say oh Brooklyn
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillier sorry to hear you're on an IV in
the hospital bro this one is for you bro
[SPEAKER_01]: this one is for you in fact not only is
this one for you we're not gonna have a
[SPEAKER_01]: contest today we're gonna be sending the
bottle of DC glass cleaner to Brooklyn for
[SPEAKER_01]: his harsh day in the hospital I'm sending
you a gift send me your address and I will
[SPEAKER_01]: send that out to you brother and I hope
you're doing well man I hope I hope it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing too serious I do I do yeah man we
got to take care of one another guys this
[SPEAKER_01]: is our community this is our community all
right here we go everybody it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: wake the bake
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah oh that tasted so amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really something to be said for
dry turp dip rips the water definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: without a shadow of a doubt is altering
the effects of the turps
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mixed a little I've played around
trust me I've played around how about this
[SPEAKER_01]: got an invite recently to high integrity
glass art and he's got the team Japan guys
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house absolutely fucking crushing
it pretty excited about that those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are talent beyond talent and so we're
gonna make a video it's gonna be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble man video in a long time damn a
hemorrhoid Lance that's probably no fun
[SPEAKER_01]: hey Jesus Christ talk about the most
uncomfortable position ever to get onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the table and to just fucking bend over
and put your ass right in that dude's face
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry that you had to have that done
but I bet you it's probably a better to
[SPEAKER_01]: have it done than to not have it done
yeesh hemorrhoids talk about a pain in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ass no pun intended no pun intended there
boy all right I feel iry like really iry
[SPEAKER_01]: oh dude the Japanese glassblowers is gonna
be a really good video nothing but the
[SPEAKER_01]: best coming from high integrity glass art
I will ask them John I will absolutely ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them I wish I could sit here but the Sun
is so bright well I guess I could do this
[SPEAKER_01]: oh yeah I know we can't be scooping the
saltwater that's not gonna happen yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good reception pretty beautiful
water no interruptions this time we're
[SPEAKER_01]: blessed you guys let's uh oh what should
we talk about on this beautiful wake and
[SPEAKER_01]: bake why is it that that that first bake
of the day I mean I could wait eight hours
[SPEAKER_01]: after I do my first bake of the day the
amount of time that I sleep and I won't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel the same way there really is
something about sleeping and waking up and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying cannabinoids for the first time
I'm sure there's a science behind it that
[SPEAKER_01]: explains you know there's something a
little bit different going on after a good
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep the Japanese bluer do the dots
triple things in their glass they sure do
[SPEAKER_01]: no shanzo let's not let's absolutely not
talk about that let's talk about anything
[SPEAKER_01]: but that I want to stay away from yeah
Johnny B needs to I know dude Mike I know
[SPEAKER_01]: we really need to that guys sorry about
that guys I got a phone call there but I
[SPEAKER_01]: put he might call back so I'll have to do
it again but yeah Johnny B and puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesdays dude trust me we were together
the other day for the first time in a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time we had a nice little chill session
and we both agreed how much we miss
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out and enjoying ourselves on puff
Wednesdays so we're definitely gonna try
[SPEAKER_01]: and get together I don't know if it'll be
a puff Wednesday or if I'll have them by
[SPEAKER_01]: for a wake and bake but I miss Johnny B
for sure it was so good to see him the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day he came by my house and picked
up a trailer he's really busy guy now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: good to see him blowing up in his life and
doing so good with his business and his
[SPEAKER_01]: grows back on and I mean what can you say
about Johnny B he's literally an
[SPEAKER_01]: all-around awesome guy he's the people's
man how about a light anyone everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody you want to like I'll give you a
like there you go I like it you try any of
[SPEAKER_01]: his crop I smoked a little bit of his crop
yeah he brought some Medi Kush maybe Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe one maybe Kush Jesus I can't believe
I forgot the name of that yeah he brought
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the rosin that he made I'm not
gonna lie I miss the days where Johnny B
[SPEAKER_01]: had hash Johnny B doesn't have hash too
much these days he's got rosin which is
[SPEAKER_01]: really the case for everyone which isn't
the worst case in the in the world but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's definitely like when the when the
hash dries up and you start seeing less
[SPEAKER_01]: and less of it it's generally telling me
that the material is less good it's less
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and therefore them they're all
pressing it into into rosin because let's
[SPEAKER_01]: be honest if you get a five or a six star
you're not going to be you're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it you're not gonna be pressing that
I don't oh what camera lens do I use I use
[SPEAKER_01]: a 5d mark mark 3 let's say Canon and I use
the MPE nice brat yeah I get that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people I'm gonna go on the grow
tube roundtable sometime Jack Lee we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get it happening I sent off an
email to Dago and we'll make it happen and
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool sent links before I don't think
much about HTFSE myself I do know some
[SPEAKER_01]: people that just don't like hash and would
take rosin over six yeah John you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what or Dan you know what I I call
bullshit I say if those people actually
[SPEAKER_01]: had six star resin like constantly along
with their oil they would very like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just I've met very few people who choose
that oil over hash when the hash is top
[SPEAKER_01]: quality most people don't have access to
top quality hash the type of hash that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see selling for a hundred to two hundred
dollars a gram six star that leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing behind it basically is oil they
say that because it's all they have
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly yeah it's easy to say that when
you don't have six star you know but
[SPEAKER_01]: having a bunch of six star and just seeing
it sit there and go yeah I don't even puff
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit I just hit the oil it's like no
no no no what's the price of six star out
[SPEAKER_01]: here if you can find it it could be up to
a hundred bucks a gram easy yeah lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been scared by mids for sure a
lot of people when they think hash they
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't here's the bottom line there's
something in the hash that's not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: oil the oil is pulling a specific fraction
depending on the polarity of it and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving behind certain things and when you
when you keep those certain things in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular that fibrous math that all of
the cannabinoids and terpenes are birthed
[SPEAKER_01]: into existence via there's something to be
had in there there's something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: more I feel like it's a full course meal
compared to a dessert when I hit rosins
[SPEAKER_01]: even when the rosin is made from hash now
of course that's just my opinion but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know as I get deeper into these
conversations with people with different
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions it's often the first thing I'll
ask is do you have access to six star hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and is it always in your stash and the
answer is pretty much ninety nine percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of the time no no I do not no I do not now
they might think they smoked full melt but
[SPEAKER_01]: it might have been full melt FAU X because
a lot of people have the foam out and so
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have the foam out and you're
hitting that you're not gonna be impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seriously like you know what my oil
is way better than that and I would agree
[SPEAKER_01]: with you but if you're hitting six star oh
my god okay here's the thing if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting six star and you love oil then
here's something that you should do take
[SPEAKER_01]: the six star and make your oil with it
because if you make oil with a full whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant you're pulling a lot of bulbous
heads and I can promise you those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads that if I could extract them and
isolate the mechanically and separate them
[SPEAKER_01]: you would see that they are not the heads
you want to smoke they make up a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: chunk of yield and that's why oil goes
from from hash going from 10 to 12 to 15
[SPEAKER_01]: percent tops on returns you see oil
getting into the 20s that's because of
[SPEAKER_01]: those bulbous heads those heads have a
profile they're just not from my
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective a connoisseur smoke so if I
was a big oil head I would still you know
[SPEAKER_01]: separate all my gland heads via dry
sifting or wet wash make half and then
[SPEAKER_01]: make your oil with those specific heads
whether you mix them whether you make them
[SPEAKER_01]: all separate and have your 90 micron oil
and your 73 micron oil is up to you but it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely gives you a different overview
of just removing those bulbous heads I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to call them contaminants
because they have medicinal components to
[SPEAKER_01]: them that are very important I have a
theory that they are the ones that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: more of the CBD in CBD high CBD ratio
cultivars and the reason that is is
[SPEAKER_01]: because of when we make water hash or dry
sift with Haley's Comet or any of the high
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD cultivars the yields are very very
very poor and generally most of those
[SPEAKER_01]: people already know that oil is the best
way to go about whether it's a rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: process or a chemical extraction you're
going to need that melting factor to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: those bulbous heads off and to acquire
that profile yeah Nick 73 for the win I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you what a beautiful buzz out here on
the house sound really always enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out with you guys and chilling
with you I can give you some knowledge on
[SPEAKER_01]: curing hash sure you know curing is an
opinion it's not a fact so the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: cure and we're not talking about drying
okay oh peace Brooklyn Hillier please send
[SPEAKER_01]: me the email BC bubble man at iCloud.com
today right away and I will absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: send you that I hope you're feeling better
buddy okay so drying and curing drying is
[SPEAKER_01]: very different from curing we want to get
the moisture content out of the gland wax
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane we want to make sure all the
water that's on the outside of that gland
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane is also dried off so it's sort of
a two-part process first getting the water
[SPEAKER_01]: on the outside of the gland heads removed
and then getting the moisture content
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the wax membrane properly removed
once those are done you can now actually
[SPEAKER_01]: cure your hash and people always ask me
what's the best way to cure your hash well
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like asking me what's the best time
to cut your plants down and preserve the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and terpene profile as they
are that's going to also be an opinion so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I tell people try a variety of
things with your plants cut them down a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple weeks early a week early right on
time a week later a couple of weeks later
[SPEAKER_01]: find your sweet spot find the differences
find the changes that are occurring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and terpene profile in those
specific times keep the data it's valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: and then moving on to how do you cure the
resin well it's the same thing you can
[SPEAKER_01]: cure it okay if you're putting it in a
fridge or a freezer that's more preserving
[SPEAKER_01]: it and although you will moisture can be
removed that way and it can affect terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles I don't really call it a cure I
call it more of a preservation like I like
[SPEAKER_01]: this the way it is and I want it to stay
that way I don't want it to change I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to butter up I want everything to
stay the same boom into the fridge or the
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer that's preserving curing on the
other hand is something that you can do in
[SPEAKER_01]: different environments so dark
environments cold environments different
[SPEAKER_01]: textures and and like substances to cover
the hash and some people put it away in
[SPEAKER_01]: glass some people put it away in like a
humidor type thing on screen some people
[SPEAKER_01]: there's such a variety of ways to put hash
you're going to have to find the best way
[SPEAKER_01]: for you well the freeze dryer is something
a little different right you'll notice
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you dry your hash naturally using
a desiccant like the pizza box cardboard
[SPEAKER_01]: technique that I've shown that the hash
will cure differently than if you suck
[SPEAKER_01]: with a vacuum the moisture content out of
the wax membrane so you can do that as
[SPEAKER_01]: well but you'll notice differences and
those differences are so subtle and so
[SPEAKER_01]: small that I couldn't really explain to
you exactly what they are particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: because you might be using different
cultivars in different environments etc
[SPEAKER_01]: etc but I will say that the freeze dryer I
told Tony when we got the freeze dryers
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would still want to have hash that
is done the old school way so we have
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're sort of like different
products anytime you mess with the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: content of the of the plant you're going
to be affecting the modulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore the effects of that plant and so
yeah it's curing is a tricky one I have
[SPEAKER_01]: that 10 year old hash I have I have it in
wood I have it in glass I have it out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the open I have some in the fridge I have
some in a colder environment and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: some at room temperature yeah there's a
whole bunch of different ways who you
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to be I don't know who I'm trying
to be man I think just me I think just me
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's the only person I know how
to be really I prefer it too I it's a it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like psychedelic experience being me which
I'm sure it's like that to be you as well
[SPEAKER_01]: how long bubble man product being cured
well it really depends angel you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: cure in my opinion more importantly
happens along the line of properly you
[SPEAKER_01]: know desiccant room to a little colder
than room temperature once you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the science of extracting and and with
laboratory grade freeze dryers then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into a perspective that sure you
can cure the hash as long as you want but
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects aren't really going to be you
know what I noticed with the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash that hits the marketplace especially
in places like California just sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: like a stone what was that stone stone mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogers right fuck I like that sorry I've
got a small little when I turned my phone
[SPEAKER_01]: sideways I only get a couple of lines of
text so I really have to read everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are saying and trust me I'm
reading it all while I'm talking to you
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah what's the longest you have cured
hash ten years ten years is my oldest hash
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and yeah can you talk about the
new terpene syrup I can tell you this much
[SPEAKER_01]: okay it is really really interesting I've
never had such an experience I mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really Tony's I got to give my hats off to
the guy because he's changing the game you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the idea first of all how high I got
off of it was incredible it and I had I
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbed like 20 or 30 minutes earlier so I
wasn't expecting to feel anything even
[SPEAKER_01]: though I'm well aware of the modulating
effects of terpenes I always kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: understood that they would happen together
simultaneously instantaneously and when I
[SPEAKER_01]: put he said put a mill of the syrup in the
water I put it in I watched it dissipate
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you guys I'll make a video I
watched it dissipate into these long
[SPEAKER_01]: strands that kind of vibrated and just
dispersed into this cloud and then
[SPEAKER_01]: disappeared I also put in some of the
xylitol which is like his terp sugar it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not sugar it's xylitol it's a sweetener
and it's pretty sweet like it's nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Jack Frost that he sent me and some
OG 18 so I put in the Jack Frost I put a
[SPEAKER_01]: little of the syrup in I drank half this
glass of water it was really tasty you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like light but like to a connoisseur
especially someone say that had that
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar that just took a dab of it then
to be given that water I could really see
[SPEAKER_01]: it being used as a pairing in a dab bar I
could really see it transferring over the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole differences of the vibes of hanging
out and getting super high versus people
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out and drinking alcohol socially
I love the idea of creating a more social
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of cannabis use with large amounts
of people I noticed when I go to certain
[SPEAKER_01]: events like cannabis cups people are
smoking concentrates and they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same ability to articulate and stay
awake and they're zombied out they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of like this and there's a lot
of them and I love the idea of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: together with people and and smoking a lot
and medicating but not to fall asleep I
[SPEAKER_01]: love the idea of micro doses of dabs with
the terpenes in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene water it's a really spacey almost
psychedelic headspace that you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: and it keeps you awake and it doesn't burn
you out and it doesn't make you want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to sleep and I'm telling you I not that
I'm against lounges where people just go
[SPEAKER_01]: and get annihilated and fall asleep I'm
not saying get rid of those okay I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting against anything that already
exists I'm fighting for more so I just see
[SPEAKER_01]: the day where we could get into more of
that social aspect and and really help at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time people move away slowly from
alcohol use because I know when people use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis even in micro micro amounts they
tend to drink less it'd be cool to have in
[SPEAKER_01]: bars at great concerts you know where you
could go and get a pairing terpene water a
[SPEAKER_01]: little vapor hit who have hash in the
dispensaries around don't offer it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge yeah it's a tough one dude
that's awesome sounds so nice can't wait
[SPEAKER_01]: to see that being put out in bulk funny
I've never noticed anything like that not
[SPEAKER_01]: into sleeping lounges I prefer
energy-filled terp cafes that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying Peter I'm not into sleeping lounges
either I don't get tired it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: me want to go to sleep so I get really
excited and no neck lutes I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical extracted resins so people using
butane and propane and hexane it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty standard most people know that I
don't use those products at all my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is I am promoting solvent-less
methods of extraction chemical solvents
[SPEAKER_01]: you know ones that come from petrochemical
factories not the chemical solvents that
[SPEAKER_01]: are naturally occurring in cannabis again
no don't be sorry bro don't be sorry it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets tricky when we talk about it and I
hear Tony be like oh we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent-less it's like well you know
terpenes are solvents they are
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbons so that's not solvent-less
it's not solvent-free it's like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents in all of our cannabis extracts
what I'm trying to say is I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the beautiful hydrocarbon solvents
that cannabis produces I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the petrochemical extracts that multi
national conglomerate corporations are
[SPEAKER_01]: sucking out of the earth and poisoning the
world with so that's really what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying maybe we just say poisons that's a
good way to say it Sean's Sean's oh you
[SPEAKER_01]: know poison-free it might be a little
harsh but it's the truth you know we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to you know Tony and I are coming
from a perspective where we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the most conscious and because of it I
can promise you this the as the higher the
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity is the lower the profits will be
that's why we're trying to come in at a
[SPEAKER_01]: low dollar we're trying to wholesale these
products out for not insane dollars so
[SPEAKER_01]: they end up as two hundred dollar grams we
want to keep them under a hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know these motherfuckers are
doubling their money so if you can come in
[SPEAKER_01]: between thirty and forty five dollars a
gram for really beautiful product and hey
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see it get cheaper love to see
it get cheaper if we could grow it cheaper
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could grow acres of this shit we
could I do not smoke weed fully not for
[SPEAKER_01]: fifteen years but I do have an
appreciation for it because all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish comes from the weed and of course
the fibers and the cellulose and the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential amino acid rich seed embryos
everything about it is wonderful I wear it
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat it I smoke it I put it on my skin
and yeah it's a good thing yeah well I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope so too Nick Lutz I do hope so too
we've got a bunch of cool things on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon I haven't been talking about too
much I don't like to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: full-blown shameless plugging of brands
but you guys can go check out bubble man
[SPEAKER_01]: brand on Instagram and that's that's the
best way to keep updated hey what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on Indra yeah dude right we're on the boat
man we are on the boat it's a good day on
[SPEAKER_01]: the boat what about rosin prices yeah what
about rosin prices a lot of work can go
[SPEAKER_01]: into rosin prices that's why it depends on
if you're first making hash and then
[SPEAKER_01]: squishing the hash and turning it into
rosin I get seasick too
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely we've had a pot of orcas just
literally right off right like right here
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping out of the water oh did I might
mute the mic I didn't I don't think I
[SPEAKER_01]: pressed the mute oh weird where the hell
was my mic that I and these phones tripped
[SPEAKER_01]: me out sorry guys yes there was a pot of
killer whales here last year we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been many dolphins humpback whales
blue whales it's pretty cool actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of wild life that comes in here
yeah it must have been the edge of my hand
[SPEAKER_01]: but I try very hard not to touch the
bottom or the top of the phone these
[SPEAKER_01]: phones look so similar I can't tell which
one's which when I'm on these on these
[SPEAKER_01]: shows there's the lions there they are
look they're in my hand I'm holding that
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain it is so calm Indra what is your
expected return when sifting good material
[SPEAKER_01]: well sift is the only a particular type of
heads only a particular size of heads so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like you're getting everything
sift isn't about getting everything the
[SPEAKER_01]: magic about sift is getting specific heads
trying to get it all is awesome at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to make medicine but I always
tell people first let's get out the best
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that will blow your mind and
that's what Sam was doing when I first met
[SPEAKER_01]: him his you know of course he had bred his
cultivars from seeds he had collected from
[SPEAKER_01]: hash producing countries around the world
bred those seeds grew those seeds process
[SPEAKER_01]: that resin it was perfection on all
accounts oh yes happy 4th of July to all
[SPEAKER_01]: my American friends happy 4th of July
that's awesome so it's all about really
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling out Sam would brag about getting
1% so I was always like yeesh 1% that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not enough so sift in my opinion is
something that you do and then afterwards
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to take the material
and do something else with because you are
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting everything how did Sam be able
to become legally to do all the work he
[SPEAKER_01]: did well FSS you know what when he got
into trouble in Santa Cruz he left
[SPEAKER_01]: California knowing that he was just going
to continue to get in trouble because he
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't going to stop what he was doing and
he thought the best idea for him to do
[SPEAKER_01]: would be to kind of go in under a
pharmaceutical company or a nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: company under that model and apply for
licensing and permits exactly how those
[SPEAKER_01]: companies do and put CEOs in place for you
know to shake hands and sign documents and
[SPEAKER_01]: he basically did some great work I mean
the guy bred some incredible cannabis when
[SPEAKER_01]: I first went to Holland in 95 and all the
herb was skunk number one in the coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops that was all Dave's and not grown by
him or profited by him but taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones from his greenhouse through workers
or whatever and and you know passed on to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone and Vu Lee you're kind of a
character yeah skunk what am I talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about I'm talking about skunk you need to
you're deep here Vu you're deep okay you
[SPEAKER_01]: are deep in the cannabis knowledge so
we're going we're going deep we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about skunk man Sam this dude is skunk man
method is lead don't follow I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know what that means John that had to be
crazy feeling for him yeah you know he's
[SPEAKER_01]: done some incredible work I hope I hope to
be able to work with my mentor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future in Jamaica that's really been my
dream trying to get it going on yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrea you can catch all sorts of fish
here a lot of people from China and
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnam Asian countries come along the the
rocks and and fish for rockfish very
[SPEAKER_01]: popular amongst those cultures and then
everyone pretty much goes into the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: and surfs surfs fishes for the salmon the
salmon is going to be spawning right away
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's 24 million I think came in four
years ago yeah dude we have an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: Asian culture here in Vancouver and
because of it I get to enjoy many many
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of their culture food being
probably the number one I do love me some
[SPEAKER_01]: some some food like whether it's from
Thailand whether it's from India whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's from China whether I just really love
all of those types of foods Indian maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my favorites actually really spicy
wicked hot Indian food love that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver's Chinatown yeah dude we have an
amazing China town we have an amazing you
[SPEAKER_01]: know NorCal nugget I'm sure we have we do
have a Filipino community for sure I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Winnipeg and we had a huge Filipino
community I had some great great times
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gaining access to that community
as a kid back in back in Winnipeg salmon
[SPEAKER_01]: is over fish that killer whales can't
produce young well Alex you know salmon
[SPEAKER_01]: spawns every year like millions and
millions of them they're every four years
[SPEAKER_01]: actually but there's different spawns that
happen this pink spawn that's coming right
[SPEAKER_01]: now was four years ago four years ago it
was the highest spawn of salmon since 1918
[SPEAKER_01]: so that goes against what you're saying in
the sense that it was more than we've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: in over a hundred years so I think
sometimes there are cycles that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand on the planet and I get that
we're we're doing damage and we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of shitty things but I think the
world has ways of balancing itself out and
[SPEAKER_01]: when I sometimes think that if our history
was allowed to go back further than this
[SPEAKER_01]: this 2,000 years I think it's a big part
of the manipulation if we had history that
[SPEAKER_01]: went back 20 or 30 or 40,000 years and
we're allowed to actually know that
[SPEAKER_01]: history we would see these larger cycles
at work for instance people are often you
[SPEAKER_01]: know obviously we're bummed out when we
hear about a new animal species making it
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the endangered list and even more
bummed out when they become extinct but
[SPEAKER_01]: how about this for a thought probably 95
plus percent of the life that's lived on
[SPEAKER_01]: this planet is extinct so it's kind of
trippy it's like this evolution right
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just completely evolving and you
know the old goes to the way just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle of life so I try to keep a positive
vibe on it I used to get really bummed out
[SPEAKER_01]: and go deep into conspiracy and the agenda
and all the crazy harsh shit that was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in the world and then I kind of
felt like maybe that was part of their
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda like they wanted me to get you know
like why am I sharing negative information
[SPEAKER_01]: when I could be sharing positive
information why do people when they pull
[SPEAKER_01]: out their phones that they want to say oh
you got to see what Donald Trump tweeted
[SPEAKER_01]: or what Ted Cruz said it was just so
stupid it's like why do you want me to be
[SPEAKER_01]: bummed out and listen to something so
stupid like why don't you bring me a
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge bomb like why don't you say hey
dude listen to this you're gonna be blown
[SPEAKER_01]: away it's Alan Watts and he's talking
about the you know what is the meaning of
[SPEAKER_01]: life and the fabric of the universe that's
what I want to be getting turned on to
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah Shonzo I mean my goodness what the
hell are we thinking guys and we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: guilty of it on some level or another
sharing bad information with people
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's politics or or propaganda or
bunk in any way shape or form it's keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: you from doing good work it's keeping you
from sharing good information exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrence McKenna Ralph Abraham Rupert
Sheldrake just to name a few Eric K
[SPEAKER_01]: Drexler wrote a wonderful book called
engines of creations and recently radical
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance about nanotechnology those
that's interesting stuff you know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of fun stuff out there science has
no agenda other than truth and more so
[SPEAKER_01]: than truth is to you know uncover dis
truth to uncover lies and so yeah Jason
[SPEAKER_01]: Silva's great he's got some really
inspirational kind of two three-minute
[SPEAKER_01]: videos that you can go check out very much
you know I put him in line with a sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: a Terrence and Alan Watts you know
philosophical deeply intelligent and very
[SPEAKER_01]: able to articulate his his information in
a in an just in a real positive manner
[SPEAKER_01]: it's inspiring actually it's quite
inspiring I'll be at Chalice he says all
[SPEAKER_01]: right Marcus we may be at Chalice Tony's
gonna try and get down there we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure for sure but we'll see what happens
oh 501 Jones I'm humbled that you say that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel that I am but I guess that's
kind of those are my inspirations so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: best if I could do them justice and really
it's all about just sharing information
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we're all here doing it's why
we have all these phones we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect we're trying to learn we're trying
to you know and I will say this right now
[SPEAKER_01]: oh have I read a behold a pale horse come
on I read that book in 1990 or 19 maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even 1989 behold a pale horse was sort of
how it all started that and Robert Anton
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilson I read the Illuminatus trilogy and
Schrodinger's cat and what are the the
[SPEAKER_01]: part one and two three Oh cosmic triggers
I read all those and then I eventually got
[SPEAKER_01]: into Terrence and I started listening to
his lectures and I started reading all his
[SPEAKER_01]: books I read archaic revival and food of
the gods and true hallucinations trilogues
[SPEAKER_01]: at the edge of the West pretty much all of
them very inspired by those guys I ordered
[SPEAKER_01]: spores from Terrence from his company in
Hawaii called Sygeny that he had with his
[SPEAKER_01]: wife cat at the time and I grew those
spores and I passed those psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms out to many many many many
people and I felt like it was really good
[SPEAKER_01]: work it was like fighting the demons it
was like this tool that you could take
[SPEAKER_01]: bring into a place like Winnipeg where
people are suffering from alcoholism and
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical addiction and bring this
psychedelic mushroom into my community and
[SPEAKER_01]: with the information that we had which was
like we're not partying man we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: and taking five grand dried grams in a
dark room we're blowing our ego right out
[SPEAKER_01]: the back door to remove that discomfort
which will follow you through a trip if
[SPEAKER_01]: you try to hold on to your ego you really
have to let go of your ego if you do try
[SPEAKER_01]: Octo Tom I would urge you to have very
good friends with you potentially one at
[SPEAKER_01]: least that's a watcher who's not involved
in the psychedelic journey that can take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of you guys make sure you're in a
safe environment you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: around glass or certain things that if you
start flailing around or moving in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that might not be conducive to being
around those those types of things it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to think about first also it's
good to look into your diet certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to upset your stomach if you
take psychedelics afterwards and that
[SPEAKER_01]: could upset your ego and if you don't take
enough to blow your ego out you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have this real intense vibe well you
know what they say about tryptamines is
[SPEAKER_01]: that our body recognize them recognizes
them so for safety aspects you know
[SPEAKER_01]: certain psychedelics take nine to ten
hours to dissolve you know to be removed
[SPEAKER_01]: from the body to be broken down so they
are no longer psychedelic things like LSD
[SPEAKER_01]: the body doesn't quite recognize that form
of the molecule but in in tryptamine form
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pure tryptamine form it can be five
minutes long not that that should give you
[SPEAKER_01]: a feeling of safety because truly that
five minutes you could live a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: lifetimes and die a thousand deaths so I
don't know if I would say it's safe but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an inward journey that each person
has to take some people wouldn't say that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's safe to change their entire lives and
when you go in and you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective changes a lot can change in a
real quick hurry I feel blessed to have
[SPEAKER_01]: done them as a young man and to have been
able to shape myself before I became in my
[SPEAKER_01]: 40s you know throughout my late teens 20s
and 30s I was able to really get get close
[SPEAKER_01]: and intimate with psychedelics
particularly mushrooms mushrooms along
[SPEAKER_01]: with potentiators MAO inhibitors like
harming and harmaline that are present in
[SPEAKER_01]: banisteriopsis in all forms we were using
the root and of course syrian rue which
[SPEAKER_01]: can be purchased at Iranian or Middle
Eastern grocery stores edible ones so they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have poisons sprayed on them and
yeah just a little bit of syrian rue with
[SPEAKER_01]: some psychedelic mushrooms will produce an
ayahuasca like effect where you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: tryptamine aspect from the psilocybin and
the psilocin and you have the MAO
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibitors the harming and the harmaline
from the whatever source you're using the
[SPEAKER_01]: syrian rue seeds or the banisteriopsis
capi oh how's that going Drew microdoses
[SPEAKER_01]: of dimethyltryptamine rips do we have to
ban Voo Lee I could just get rid of him I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I kind of wanted to leave him because
I felt like maybe he was learning but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what when a respected member of the
of the of the group here asks that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: be banned I'm gonna respect that I know
you guys aren't just trying to ban people
[SPEAKER_01]: for no good reasons I think I banned him
yeah he was kind of like he's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed like a troll but I've had these
kind of you know like not really like he
[SPEAKER_01]: might be learning you know what I mean a
few times I would reply to him and instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of trolling back he'd be like oh okay
that's cool so anyway I think we dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: some pretty good knowledge today I think
the boat is very conducive to getting me
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk I think we're gonna be doing a lot
of these boatwaking bakes I will try to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring guests we have a lot of seats here
would be nice who would I recommend for
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless companies in Canada I would
check out in Ontario glacial melts here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver you can check out West Coast
concentrates I guess they're also in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario East Coast concentrates they got a
blue a blue circular blue and white logo
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah you can check those guys out
they're all good if they have it I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: at THC Ontario I am in the Howe Sound on
those are all islands around me but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: floating on the water and the mainland is
literally right there I'm very close
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I'm so close that the people on
the dock probably heard this entire wake
[SPEAKER_01]: and bake video so thanks everyone for
coming and hanging out and I hope Brooklyn
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to send me an email so I can send
him that bottle of DC glass cleaner well
[SPEAKER_01]: retro 80s I like all people but I don't
use derogatory terms that's negative
[SPEAKER_01]: that's mean it's hateful and yeah you are
you are caught up in your your division
[SPEAKER_01]: and I understand the value of life is our
splices where we come from this hole and
[SPEAKER_01]: we splice off into these personal people
these ego based people and I get that but
[SPEAKER_01]: you're confused bro because you came from
everyone and you're going to everyone so
[SPEAKER_01]: you I mean I know you're not in the room
anymore because I blocked you out right
[SPEAKER_01]: away but I just felt like I needed to say
that anyway we're all people I am an
[SPEAKER_01]: earthling I don't feel like a Canadian as
much as an earthling and I feel that every
[SPEAKER_01]: time I travel anywhere you're all my
people and I am your people so there it is
[SPEAKER_01]: love wins Joe Rochester said it best peace

for a swim now but I'm going to gross to
[SPEAKER_01]: her penny yeah maybe I'll eat some mushy
