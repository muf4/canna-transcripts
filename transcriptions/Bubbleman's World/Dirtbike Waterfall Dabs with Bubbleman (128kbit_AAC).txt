[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here and today I'm
going to take you guys for a little boot
[SPEAKER_02]: back behind my house on my dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really taken you guys on many
dirt bike adventures, I don't think even
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been on snowboards and we've been on
boats, we've been on Argos, we've been on
[SPEAKER_02]: snowmobiles, we've been on all sorts of
fun little toys, even Harleys,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we've never taken you on the dirt
bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got some pretty cool trails up
behind my house, go up there to a
[SPEAKER_02]: waterfall, got a little zone that I like
to sit down and enjoy usually a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: puffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I figured before we started,
we would have a couple of puffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, got the mothership egg in the house,
the puking beagle quartz carb cap and
[SPEAKER_02]: dabber, as well as the quartz bowl and I
figured we'd start out with one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy, yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little candy kush from the good
folks over at Van City Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Matthew, thank you Ali,
thank you he who shall be renamed unknown,
[SPEAKER_02]: will remain unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think it's time to put a
little herb in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got a bunch of herb here on the
plate that was East Coast Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of my Jamaican, some of the Astro
Boy, some of the Sweet Skunk, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Congolese, and some of the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice variety and I've mixed it all up
and this stuff's been sitting out for a
[SPEAKER_02]: few days since Ramon and Rick were here
last.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be pretty, pretty dry and
give for some real nice vapor rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sublimator vaporizer hits out
of the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dad master styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild how much it grabs you by the
nuts when you hit this thing.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go climb some mountains on some dirt
bikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_02]: What
[SPEAKER_01]: do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys say?

[SPEAKER_01]: there There's a tension in the air Ones
and ones have a one sided love affair

[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys so I just parked the bike for
those of you who didn't get a good peek at
[SPEAKER_02]: it before That is the 450 E-X-E KTM 2,007
and I am the original owner Since it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been new, it's been mine So this is a
little waterfall that I like to visit it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just in behind my house Took us about 15
minutes to get up here but I did go to see
[SPEAKER_02]: if I could get up to the higher lookout
point for you guys, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, you saw that when I got up
to the river, the other river,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like four of them, it had taken
out the trail, so I don't know what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna do about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty major.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to figure it out,
but I thought maybe we'd go up there for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little dab session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's head up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waterfall dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love me some waterfall dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gotta figure out a good way to put
the tripod to capture such things.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that's connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's see what we can do in regards to
setting this up so you guys can see
[SPEAKER_02]: proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without me breaking my neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would be the most ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to be extra loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're taping.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is as good a spot as any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and dry right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel the splash from the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know the waterfall is loud,
but it's a nice loud, so I'll just talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit louder than usual so you guys
can actually hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna name this Tanner Falls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tanner is my son's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been coming here for probably more
than 15 years, and I've never even thought
[SPEAKER_02]: of giving it a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's break it in, shall we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hit man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaned it up, the little baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much the perfect amount of water in
the baby cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take out a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my little 10 mil nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little highly educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't wanna stay highly educated,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kinda what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna hit some of Van City
extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Muerte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the Muerte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, cushy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like a real strong OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've left it in the powder right up
until the time that they puff it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I, of course, have a huge respect
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: No reason to take your nice dry sift out
of powder form unless you're really about
[SPEAKER_02]: to puff it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well that's a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break that in half and do it in a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waterfall dab, and I hope you guys are
joining me, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just booted up here on the dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been on the dirt bike for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Felt a little bit loose coming up,
but I'll get used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start going out more now that I've
taken the plunge and jumped into the first
[SPEAKER_02]: ride of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I can ride this thing pretty
much all season long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really...
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really get all snowed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, pretty much everywhere in BC has
these epic, anywhere you go into the bush,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just doesn't even matter where,
you end up eventually in some sort of epic
[SPEAKER_02]: little nature scene like this with a
waterfall, beautiful clean water that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going all the way down to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trail that I'm on goes, it's about a
nine hour hike, and it'll take you right
[SPEAKER_02]: over into the lions, and then over top of
the lions into Cypress Bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is one of the local mountains that
you can ride here on the other side in
[SPEAKER_02]: West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we got a nice little glow
happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool down fast in the waterfall,
but waterfall popping down Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was real fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing they call it Muerte for a
good reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit is a killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't even take half of that dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's always the challenge is to
find a nice little shelf to sit the pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good one actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really wishing that I could have
taken you to the other trail because the
[SPEAKER_02]: lookout is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mountain climb is about another 15 to
20 minutes going a solid 50 to 60
[SPEAKER_02]: kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty cool, but this is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys did get to come on the ride up
here with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go for a ride in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I've chilled out and relaxed,
we'll get back up on the bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: This trail has not, for a long time,
it has not been dirt bike friendly much
[SPEAKER_02]: past here, but we'll see how far we can
take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until then enjoy some of this
waterfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there used to be some little
type of cabin that someone had built way
[SPEAKER_02]: up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one time in a big storm, it blew down
and that's what all these little pieces of
[SPEAKER_02]: wood are from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got here a little butterfly guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little nature action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little butterfly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you from a macro photographer
standpoint, they don't usually hang out
[SPEAKER_02]: for that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a very hard time in my life
getting macro photographs of butterflies
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully you guys got a nice spot
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He seems to like that rock because he's
back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he definitely likes that rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to leave him be and let him hang
out on his little spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all I know, he's filming butterfly
man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep fucking interrupting him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the rest of the trail right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to jump back on the
bike and head down there, I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I finally got the bike loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little had a little bit of trouble with it
getting up there at this angle,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she's all loaded up and that's it for
today for dirt bike riding with bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time I go out, I'll try to do
something a little bit more exciting trail
[SPEAKER_02]: wise, maybe a summit to a lake or the peak
of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try to bring some familiar faces
with me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for watching bubble man's world
and we'll see you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah.
