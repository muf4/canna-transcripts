[SPEAKER_01]: All right, day two in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting here with Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just woke up a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were up quite late.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you work every night till about
three in the morning in your garage?
[SPEAKER_02]: One room comes on at ten o'clock,
so you need three or four hours now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to do a little filming this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were talking about just stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about how Ron used to own
a hydroponics shop in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we actually met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed help with my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was quite young, probably about 18 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just starting my first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the plants got a little sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had heard rumors about this guy who
was apparently pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 25 years ago in Manitoba,
which kind of is still not really very
[SPEAKER_01]: cool of a province, wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not a cool province.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why we're here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both Ron and I probably should have lived
here most of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just probably going to chill out,
tell a few stories, puff a few bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron was talking about having 1,000 watt
light bulbs in the window of his
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics store back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember driving by before I knew him,
before I went and asked for his help,
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing these light bulbs just shining
out of the street, right onto a major,
[SPEAKER_01]: major street in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much the major street.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is on highway number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Portage Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highway number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right on highway number one,
the Trans Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had 5,000 watts burning beautifully.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it what?
[SPEAKER_02]: A three-armed sun circle, turning three of
them to show people sun circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did the police think about all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came and told me to, they didn't tell
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, listen, we know we can't stop
you from doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you continue to do it, say you get
a break in your place, we won't be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: respond because we'll be blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you could just do something about
it and do something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else we could park a police car in
front of your store, your hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: store, and see how many customers you get
in the daytime with a police car up front
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I had there before and saw
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it for an hour or two once.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they told me they were going to bring
a bus that one from the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not running.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a parking in front of my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, not that you were a really bad
dude, but you just didn't have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pot didn't have a good relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think I was having not a bad
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they hated that you loved pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could put it any more simply than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They hated that you loved pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only did you love it, you seemed
to educate and execute pot better than
[SPEAKER_01]: most.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is how well you grew
it, how much you grew it, and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: people you taught to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why Mark Emery is sitting in
prison right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he loves it to a point where he
not only wants to share the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: it got to the point where Mark stepped to
the next level and was selling the beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people have harshed on Mark saying
that they've criticized him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he sold seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a huge ripoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was making millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yes, he sold seeds that were
extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did make millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the different part.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Mark that you don't hear with many
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that Mark gave all his money
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark never bought himself anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never bought himself a house or a car
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just basically lived in his modest
apartment and gave all that money to often
[SPEAKER_01]: American growers that had been busted and
needed money for bail to get out,
[SPEAKER_01]: needed help with lawyer fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like when you go to an
auction, a silent auction, you pay more
[SPEAKER_01]: for the item than you're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't leave and complain that the
silent auction ripped you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that you supported something,
that the money went to a good cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of with Mark that you have
to really give it up to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he just gave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did it in the times of when I was
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an old dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Mark used to have a bookstore?
[SPEAKER_02]: He did, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: His interest went to pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he did it in a rough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always been also, much like you in
the sense, he's always gone a little
[SPEAKER_01]: against the grain when there was a garbage
strike in Toronto back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark was the one that organized hiring
scabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, oh, I found that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He fired scabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember the tonnage,
but he moved tonnage of garbage to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dumps from the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: On those hot summer days where the garbage
was just going to cause sickness and
[SPEAKER_01]: stench and all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that in our city.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the same thing when he was told he
couldn't sell certain types of magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got him into bongs and not being
allowed to sell bongs and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the love.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: My passion comes from the love.
[SPEAKER_02]: His passion comes from the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are both cannabis warriors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you both well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known you for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Mark for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely know that I would defend
you both in your love and passion for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say one thing right now,
too, because we're being videotaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark is teaching somebody right now in a
prison system somewhere in wherever it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi.
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yazoo City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Yazoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can guarantee that he's entertaining
and making all their lives much,
[SPEAKER_02]: much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's passing the way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Bowen wrote a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called something about the
trichome inside the trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the song, he writes about Mark Emery
and how he collected the fingers of
[SPEAKER_01]: activism and made them into a fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of a metaphor that we were all sort
of apart and away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He congealed us and got everyone to sort
of do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the song, he sings, Uncle Sam has
ingested marijuana in the form of Mark
[SPEAKER_01]: Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he basically sings that that's going
to affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing because he basically wrote
that if the United States inhaled Mark
[SPEAKER_01]: Emery into their system, that he was
literally marijuana and that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: change, that he would change their system
from within.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can honestly say the prosecuting
attorney who prosecuted Mark Emery is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same man who a year and a half later or
two and a half years later was the
[SPEAKER_01]: promoter of legalization in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can wrap your head around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they did ingest marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've seen Colorado bring legal
cannabis to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a variety of other Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were sort of validating that Mark
did get all this rock and rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hard to say, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote it in a song a few years before
it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, right on from Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see him soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one thing we all say about Mark,
though, too, I just want to throw this in
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't know who will hear this,
but Jody does pretty good behind him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jody's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's done a really amazing job.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stepped up at a very young age and
just a person that wasn't in the scene at
[SPEAKER_01]: all and came into the scene and absolutely
just has become one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: spokespeople for our scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's taken really good care of his
business while he's gone, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can see, we talked to
employees, we talked to... And more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly, she's visited Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at least once a month,
maybe twice a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just give Jody something for this
all, too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're in our chat right now and one
of our members is saying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, people say bad things about Mark and
Jody and I just want to say that people
[SPEAKER_01]: will always want to attach themselves to
any type of fame or any type of subject
[SPEAKER_01]: that is being spoken about, any type of
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jody and Mark, they're kind of famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a newsworthy story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're our representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent us in the news and in the
media, our activism and all the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've done over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of our representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get a few to do that in the
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jody, you know, Jody and Mark,
Mark is a strong personality, so sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: he rubs people the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great that he manifested Jody into
his life because it's hard to see Jody
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbing anyone the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she's just sweet, nice person,
wholesome, honest, like just a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to call them both my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think of the strong girls of the
pot world, it would maybe be an old guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we got to add Hillary in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary was definitely like the original
powerful you know, like just incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: spokesperson, always came out smelling
like a rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you saw Hillary on the news,
it was like woo-hoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then she stepped away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is Hillary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who Hillary always was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when she stepped away, Jody really
kind of stepped into that position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never thought anyone would be able
to sort of step into that position because
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary would just, you know, she would
pull it off every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Hillary was born to be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jody, I don't know, I didn't know Jody.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know Hillary,
Hillary Black started the BC Compassion
[SPEAKER_01]: Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met her years before that when she
worked with Mark Emery at the original
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was probably 17 years old when we
first met Hillary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sat in your living room that one day
and said, I want to start something to
[SPEAKER_02]: help for compassion for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I remember her saying she didn't
like the word medical and she didn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: the word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she wanted to call it cannabis
compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she was kind of thinking about
moving to San Francisco to live with Todd
[SPEAKER_01]: McCormick, another well-known cannabis
activist who she was dating at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she was having some difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just moved to British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she decided it was either move down
with Todd, which I'm very glad she didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd ended up getting arrested in that
fiasco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing in a mansion in Bel Air,
a couple of properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The property is over from the Reagan's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Peter McWilliams grow as
well, where Peter McWilliams ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: passing away and all of that due to not
being able to take cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-amedic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He choked on his own vomit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had taken his mom's home away and
told him that they were going to keep,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if he smoked cannabis that they
weren't going to be releasing his home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a terrible story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd did five years on Terminal Island for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rene Beauger was wanted for a 10 year
sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to escape up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when Chris Bennett met her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all these things were happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a real crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hillary, literally, I had just moved
to British Columbia from Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary was my one friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, I was right behind
her to start her Compassion Club idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the BC Compassion Club has been
around for 18 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of their first growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy to support them with cannabis,
often at a lower cost than I could find
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was definitely something that,
it was a good thing when the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Compassion Club got started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so proud of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to my local town here and go to
the Compassion Club, I just know that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people coming in that need a place
to just go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are just some friendly people that
can, you know, give them the best service
[SPEAKER_02]: they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew into such a beautiful thing with
the health center on the other side,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the massage and reiki and all these
things they offer for free from the
[SPEAKER_01]: profits of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send that over to the next side,
and then there's people that can go talk
[SPEAKER_01]: with counselors and just, it's really a
positive herbalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're on 13th and commercial
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's not even just BC
Compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think like even just our little
Nelson Compassion Club?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're popping up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hillary really set the bar with
what... It's not about making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's about... I see people go
in, they get a smile on their face when
[SPEAKER_02]: they always listen to the advice of Mr.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever was told, the
watermelon or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see a smile on their face,
they walk out, you know they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a better day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want another rip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not exactly sure what we're going
to do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably do a few clips from Ron's
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did just cut down the majority of his
trough, but he's got a new one flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go in there and get some tips
from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe we'll be making some bubble
hash today as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron's got a whole bunch of nice material
put aside for bubbling as well as dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several pounds sitting out on the
screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you that a little later on too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we bump into some local
Nelson friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be nice to see some Kootenay friends
that I haven't seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later tonight, I think we're going to
go by the Ainsworth hot springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys later.
