[SPEAKER_00]: Alright Johnny, take two.
[SPEAKER_00]: See as though you're in a killer rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's snowing!
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheely, utterly, disgustingly,
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't bring the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: No dry sift?
[SPEAKER_00]: No dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put the hits on each dabber the
way I did last time, so we will stop
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will stop again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we gonna dabber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take three?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take three, my brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is snowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, hey everybody, welcome to Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Puff Wednesday with my good
buddy Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our third attempt at filming this
small sequence, as the first time I set up
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera, I had left it on time lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at what our first
session looked like on time lapse,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the meantime, I was thinking
maybe Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could, what we wanted to do was come
out and show you guys, A, it's snowing
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy here in British Columbia right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been dumping all morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been dumping all month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been dumping all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently we did this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely snowed maybe once or twice
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been snow every single month of the
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should start seeing the polar bears in
the day pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, they'll be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming back apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about me not getting a
turp dip last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're definitely taking care of that
this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swiss tsunami, just the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way life works and the way things
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm wearing the Blue River shirt,
I'm probably doing a Blue River dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing we realized, turps taste so
much better when it's cold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're completely kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it does add a little added
extra to the shiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three attempts at this, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that because I only had one dab
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is three attempts, two dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three plus two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means we're going to do five more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there's a system to our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our plan was to come out here,
hit a couple of dabs, move ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: inside where we hit more dabs,
show you the quality of the dry sift that
[SPEAKER_00]: I separated into these different piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe if we still had time to
take the lower quality piles and send them
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I only have my V1 set up
right now as I'm still waiting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: foot pedal on the V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still can press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little sizzling on there from the ice
that drips through.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ice dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to clean that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely getting ice dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best thing about this, I'm a little
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little bit of ice right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually slowing down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The snow's changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had these big white flakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I see stuff melting around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of warming up happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is March.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is March.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is March.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you what they say about
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: In like a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in like a lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out like a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have heard that a million times due
to my birthday being in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: His birthday's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the end of March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's one thing that's pretty cool
about this whole scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great time to make hash because
it's colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know how hard it is to make dry
sift and do your sifting when it's like 33
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees or 32 degrees and you're sitting
inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't go over that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so when it's snowing and it's cold,
pull out your screens, pull out your bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best time to start making and
actually processing your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it cold, we always say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just counting in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the cell phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was in the first episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that this is the under the table
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping it warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure he's not getting the extra
added snow dab like I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does not get an ice dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he might.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's headed to Barcelona right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everyone's at Spanibus.
Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're there right now watching us
do Puff Wednesday in the snow and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in 30 degree weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the best hash and turps in the
world right in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of works out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of the best hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the beauty of sharing the
knowledge and helping educate others as to
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do this, that you can be anywhere
in the world and have the greatest hash in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna head inside after some tasty
dabs and we will see you in a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I'm back inside now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Johnny B is no longer with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blew a bunch of time and he actually
had a situation arise where he had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to his office and take care of some
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up breaking up the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up with 60 grams of heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus, I guess, just over 42 grams of
what I would call contaminant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still a squishable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to squish it for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was gonna be kind of fun,
but he told me off camera that he actually
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to give it to the gentleman who
produced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that makes sense that he would want to
see the quality differences in everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that got separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maybe next time we'll get to squish
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I just put a little bit
of my really high-end dry sift in this
[SPEAKER_00]: little packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a small amount, maybe a half gram,
maybe a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how much it was exactly,
but I figured we'd do a little Sasquatch
[SPEAKER_00]: press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my V1 back in action as I'm still
awaiting the foot pedal to set up my air
[SPEAKER_00]: compressor to the V2, which is actually
just at the foot of the tripod here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess, waste no more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little squish in and see what
we can produce from this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was a fine little
squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up with this sort of buttery-like
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took some macro photographs of it to give
you guys a little bit of a better idea as
[SPEAKER_00]: to the quality of what we're dealing with
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't weigh the first amount,
but it was a very small, small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably less than half a gram,
but it looks like I got almost half a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, good return, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressed out a little bit of that dry sift
as well, which we can see the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than that, I can show you the
unpressed hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 60 grams of heads, if you can
believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is my chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of get an idea of the quality here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can't get it even closer
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so as you can see by the color,
not by the smell, because you can't smell
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I can attest, there's a difference
in the smell of 99.9% Gladeheads when you
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up and you get it to this
perfect, perfect place that you just lose
[SPEAKER_00]: that, whatever that, sometimes it's almost
hayish, almost greenish, almost plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter-esque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it in bubble hash, I've seen it
in dry sift, but this is void of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very sandy and thick texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you touch it, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fluffy and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really thick and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we do a quick little rip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the sapphire all cleaned up here,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting a little warmer than usual,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's at 660 degrees, I'm usually
more out of 580, but with the dry sift,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hit it a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rosin, I usually turn it down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we put a little of this dry
sift mixed with a little of this buttery
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cake batter rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's do a Blue River Terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice selection of terps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see, we've got the Jack Frost,
the Clementine, the Swiss Tsunami,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tangy, the Karma's Bitch, and the
Lemon Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go Karma's Bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Neville Rec, I believe,
which is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville Rec, crossed with RD-1,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go, gearing up,
getting ready for a Puff Wednesday without
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind telling you, I miss you,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B, it was kind of like pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having a good time out there in
the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still snowing like crazy,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off you had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cut this Puff Wednesday
fairly short, not get too much further
[SPEAKER_00]: into it, other than enjoying a nice rip of
the rosin press and the dry sift that I
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join me if you have your rig
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, two, one, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, maybe, just maybe, I can get
even a little bit closer of the
[SPEAKER_00]: portability of these nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little bit closer and show you the
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a serious rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Puff Wednesday rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.
We'll see you next time.
We'll see you next time.
We'll see you next time.
