[SPEAKER_00]: going on YouTube bubble man here just one
of my last days in Amsterdam and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go live yes I am live look at that
just riding my bike through Amsterdam here
[SPEAKER_00]: having a very nice time it's a beautiful
beautiful day and just on my way to go see
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend figured I would tell you guys a
little bit about my new online course for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you that haven't seen I'm doing a
solventless extraction course in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with gonja talks the free
four-part series is already up actually
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to be doing a more
in-depth version of the course here soon
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are it's going to be an actual
pay course and so oh no to the next one
[SPEAKER_00]: the new market all right following my
friend right now is a little bit chaotic
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm driving a bike through Amsterdam
and there's cars and people everywhere can
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about the misconception of
cannabis psychosis well um that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult one you know I used to have a
roommate who you know truly was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis wasn't for him and I think it
really opened a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception up in him I had never seen
it before but I think cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing substance but you have to
understand there's so many people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world but there's always going to be
someone who it affects in a way that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not so positive quick little change of
hands there kind of sketchy we got 20
[SPEAKER_00]: people watching live but really what I
want to talk to you today is the course so
[SPEAKER_00]: my bio on Instagram has if you go to go
follow me on Instagram at BC bubble man in
[SPEAKER_00]: my bio there's a link to the cannabis
gonja talks University your gonja talks
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless extraction course and
basically the first four videos were oh
[SPEAKER_00]: the next chat has church I'm hoping will
be on Sunday but the first four videos
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did were basically free I did four
modules I talked about the different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of glandular trichomes I spoke about water
extraction and freezing the wax membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolating glandular trichomes to a
ninety nine point nine percent purity I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke about dry sifting the mechanical
screen separation of using different size
[SPEAKER_00]: screens carding and a little bit about the
DVD static tech and then I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin as well and I went in depth to
moisture content flour versus hash plate
[SPEAKER_00]: speed temp different units that can be
used to process and you know it was a free
[SPEAKER_00]: course so I didn't go as deep as I could
have but the reception was so good to the
[SPEAKER_00]: course that we decided to do a much more
in-depth course and I guess that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a lot more of my time up so we
decided to make a pay course the team I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with has been incredibly
professional they put together a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great course and I'm going to be the
professor for that course it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an online course there's going to be three
modules bubble hash dry sift and rosin is
[SPEAKER_00]: it clean that's great to hear we are just
riding you can just see where I am right
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's kind of crazy you guys are seeing
everything that's going by but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really catching oh good Joel good I hope
that I hope that it's well look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: price that it is for 249 bucks you're
absolutely going to get your money's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a certificate in the
end so you'll be certified as the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: man solventless extraction courses is
completed and I'm also going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: coupons for some of the different tools
that will be using from the bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble nows the mechanical screens the
rosin presses either Sasquatch or pure
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure I don't want to be able to give
you guys discounts on some of these units
[SPEAKER_00]: so when you pick up this information and
you learn it you want to apply it and this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be very applicable information you'll
be able to start a company based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: information I'm going to share for you for
a measly 249 bucks I think it'll be well
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it and well priced and I'm looking
really forward to it so if you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: any questions at all about it or anything
else for that matter feel free to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: because here we are this is great what we
have to go what over what bridge it's

actually spent some time here and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a beautiful city you know and it
helps off obviously when you have friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know the city really well I've
been coming here of course for 23 years so
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to know it pretty well over
the last few years funny to see such a
[SPEAKER_00]: small group of people but it must be three
or four in the morning back home in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: right now because it's I don't know 11 10
30 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Amsterdam we've got a bit of a
hill here not a bit of a hill pump those
[SPEAKER_00]: legs Ian pump it I got my buddy in front
of me Ian Davidson from Segra pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome organic farmer and a great guy all
in all been working with him with with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Segra team for the last six to eight
months and it's just been a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: journey they're all great people and they
have a really really solid business plan
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring tissue culture to the cannabis
industry in a very precise and
[SPEAKER_00]: professional method manner that will
probably change the game all right
[SPEAKER_00]: Norwegian Frog here I'm gonna change hands
again whoo these bikes are not that easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive without hands oh it's just 118 in
California that's why I do need my KTM
[SPEAKER_00]: Vondelpark Utrecht centrum all right so
we're probably gonna be crossing over this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big old street right here centrum
here we go oh we're going right through
[SPEAKER_00]: where's my bike yes exactly found it let's
just hope I don't smash in but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted you guys to come with me
I wanted to talk about this course that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing and share with you a little bit
of the beauty of Amsterdam as we bike
[SPEAKER_00]: through the city mind your step mind your
step there's some houseboats over there 2
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Edmonton well thanks for joining me
everyone we got 52 live viewers right now
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's really cool does anyone have
any questions about the course or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that you want to ask me the course so
I'll tell you something if you don't of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I've consumed today are you kidding
me the course is going to not only have
[SPEAKER_00]: three modules bubble hash dry sift and
rosin but it's going to have four videos
[SPEAKER_00]: in each module and then it's also going to
have a live demonstration video where I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing the process for the particular
particular module and you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch live and ask questions and have your
questions answered I have been to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse coffee shop took my friend
there on day one we didn't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase anything I'm pretty connected
here in Amsterdam and don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase from coffee shops but had to go
show them it's a lovely little lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: little shop no unfortunately I'm not able
to share tech that's not my tech but see
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can break here and actually stop what
do you think of them apples Ian amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: this place is amazing it's pretty good
right I don't want to leave man we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: cruising I thought already I thought
Aurora was already leading the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture method well I don't think that
they're leading the tissue culture method
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to be doing it
through their new partnership with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nandia labs and one of the things that
Andy offers is cleaning up genetics but
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega is a little bit different in the
sense that they have an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication rate and they have a
molecular biology lab that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized through the use of hops a
plant that has had tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars spent on it for the genome so
they're doing things they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: specializing on tissue culture and not
doing a lot of else it's fun having you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys here with me what's that big u-turn
all right we're doing a u-turn I'm letting
[SPEAKER_00]: Ian navigate and he's never been to
Amsterdam before so this is awesome and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on the bike path going the wrong way
so here we go here we go nice and tight
[SPEAKER_00]: you're most welcome I'm really excited to
be working with the ganja talks team
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very professional you guys are
going to get a certificate when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble man course the solventless
extraction course when we finish you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get a nice certificate for that and you'll
have a lot of knowledge like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier you'll really be able to apply
this knowledge potentially start your own
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction company and of course as always
I'll be answering questions on every
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of all of the processes who were
