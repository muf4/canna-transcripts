[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome everybody to Hash Church
episode 15 of 2.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be a fun little episode today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a whole bunch of new people that I
have never had on before, so that should
[SPEAKER_04]: be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just check my headphones here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure everything is on the up and up
and put those invitations out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send these invitations out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure we're all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing a music episode today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been wanting to do one for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of spaced in regards to a couple of
friends that I wanted to invite in that I
[SPEAKER_04]: waited last minute and may not be able to
make it now, but we'll see what goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: See if we can't get Mr. Skunkman Sam in
the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all new people that a lot have
never been in here, so we may have some
[SPEAKER_04]: technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see how easy it is for them to get
in on the platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you guys got a huge good group in
the in the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_04]: 205 people watching live and I myself
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okie dokie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say something else,
but first I'm going to turn my mic off,
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think you hear me both times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can totally hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear me 1, 2, 3?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you 1, 2, 3, Dr. Seuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I turned my mic off, so now I
understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Alex that just came into the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Alex?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me, Bobble?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, with the professional microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's obvious to be a singer's music today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Testing testing 1, 2, 3.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Rogers in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have my engineer hook up my home
studio and now I don't even know how to
[SPEAKER_10]: use my computer without this microphone.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a it's a necessary irony.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you recognize Alex Skunkman Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see your face again.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he from SC Labs?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're thinking Alec.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is you would have recognized him,
if at all, from the Milk Vague back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he he kind of had like dreadlocks and
stuff and looked a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like much better like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the rock the door for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam has been to countless, countless shows
at the Milk Vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I'd recognize Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely recognize that character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, you would you would recognize
Skunkman Sam for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good to have you in here, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you've been rocking hard with the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_04]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been that's been fucking successful
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, yeah, even a blind hog finds that
you're a corn, Bobble.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's early and my brain's not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe if I smoke some of this resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I got to roll one up,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I want to smoke some of that resin,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you teleport that my way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex, are you in America or in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I actually I live in Ashland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, hippie town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we won't hold that against you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in Amsterdam for the last 35 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can y'all Netherlands praten?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not speak Dutch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I won't hold it against you,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remind me, Sam, of my of Mark Rose,
my manufacturer in Nepal, who's he's lived
[SPEAKER_04]: in Nepal for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a Nepali wife and Nepali children
speak a word in that he does not speak a
[SPEAKER_04]: word of Nepalese.
[SPEAKER_04]: He refuses to he's like, I'm not I'm not
learning Nepalese like they teach them all
[SPEAKER_04]: English.
[SPEAKER_06]: I lived in India often.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been shopping on for a decade,
lived in the country for several years,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I can at least be good enough to go
shopping or direct a taxi driver or buy or
[SPEAKER_06]: sell or, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the one thing about Amsterdam is I
live there for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't have to speak Dutch,
you know, because it is an English
[SPEAKER_10]: speaking city.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially me, because I was in the
scientific world with doctors,
[SPEAKER_06]: lawyers and all this kind of crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would have really had to really speak
Dutch then.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I bet you they would all speak
English.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secretary that spoke English and Dutch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's all you need right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Sam's been growing cannabis in
Holland for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex, he's a breeder of he's the breeder
of skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Won the first cannabis cup with his seed
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any Sacred Heart seeds back in like eight?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it 89 or 90?
[SPEAKER_04]: 88 88 that he goes back way further than
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first cup was 95.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my first cup was 98.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that's I only heard about those.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was only three people participating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the seed bank with Neville and SSC,
a seed company from Rotterdam and me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Sam, have you noticed that the SSC is
is back?
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe one of the sons is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met them at the where was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona, Spanabes when we were there the
last time I ran into them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And who's doing it is actually their kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can give us the legitimization of that
new organization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's legit or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they still have anything
that they had before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what they're selling.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that I met one of the original
SSC guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was there also with his son.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted to introduce me to his son.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had put out in Dutch an organic
veggie vegetable gardening book.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a cool book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for those that don't know who we're
talking about, we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Sativa Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going back into the 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure Sam had a good
relationship with the original guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave them everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not everything, but I gave them a
lot of what they were producing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to welcome Colin into the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleasure to be on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be on with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were going to talk about music and
cannabis today, I thought, fuck,
[SPEAKER_04]: I should invite Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Alex really was like, dude,
I'll get I'll get DJ Mugs and we'll get
[SPEAKER_04]: Mojo Morgan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started thinking, like, fuck,
I know a couple of musicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put the word out to Stu Block,
who's the lead singer for Ice Maiden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it would be nice to have a metal
genre representing, although he's unable
[SPEAKER_04]: really he might make it for a half an hour
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also put the invitation out to Colin and
I put out the invitation out to Raka from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Dilated Peoples.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to make a little appearance
with us earlier today.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also invited me, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told you that I would bring my
kazoo, but I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I found was a rusty old
Jews harp that I bought in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_06]: about 45 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you could play the
[SPEAKER_04]: spoons.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how I played spoons?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hammered them out with a hammer and I
used them as hot knives because they just
[SPEAKER_04]: have a wider surface area.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was back in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But true story.
[SPEAKER_05]: True story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Marcus, it's a really interesting
topic that you and Sam are talking on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had mentioned, hey, these guys are I'd
seen their presence come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Online all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had asked you directly, hey,
what do you know about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds extremely interesting,
especially since there's such a
[SPEAKER_05]: renaissance of the Super Sativa Club,
because it brings such a mythology to to
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that I think entices everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really interesting to hear Sam's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, they're a real specialty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they did produce seeds because I
think they could make more money than
[SPEAKER_06]: growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be honest, what was really special
about these guys back in the day when they
[SPEAKER_06]: started is they were experts at light and
everything else indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew how to wire houses so that they
did not burn down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty important,
especially back in the day when they were
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of looking for anything to paint a
dirty picture about us, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any any possible dirty picture they could
could could write about us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did the sativa go, man?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I remember going into the the
katsu and it was like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it smelled total haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was it's like now it seems like the
only haze, the only fake haze you can get
[SPEAKER_10]: now is is Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's Blue Dream has haze in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But where's the real like maybe you get
that shit up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was up in Canada the day I got some
Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you know, you got maybe on the
East Coast, you could find that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the same thing with sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, where did the sativa go?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the illest, illest, illest that
Neville's haze and the super silver.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, and then if someone cries it
out, or some lemon, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not really it don't it's not that
same that same like that, that that that
[SPEAKER_06]: that distinct, like, really, the basic
problem is that haze can take up to 24
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the price in the West Coast is going
is going hella down.
[SPEAKER_10]: You think some mug will get his boutique
on and just go for it and just have and
[SPEAKER_10]: then sell it for two to two G's a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever, you know, I'm really
surprised you haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so true, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the how much can I get and how fast
can I get it mentality that really drove
[SPEAKER_04]: that that drove that haze just right out
of the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_04]: I I've got some extremely turpinoline
rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some Where's my bike going on
here right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got the amnesia haze in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got what that kind of funk that
you're talking about that turpinoline rich
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of exotic flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only takes like 10 to 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not quite that, you know,
the last time I was in Barcelona was Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had something that was 26 weeks of
flowering.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some some golden road here from
Bodhi that our grower that's our lead one
[SPEAKER_05]: of our leads in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really it's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you know, it definitely brings
you back to those those super that that
[SPEAKER_05]: super sativa club vibe where it's you
know, it really brings you back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, one of my first like the true
cultivars I fell in love with was Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, my son's middle name is Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an affinity for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Manitoba, my old mentor,
Ron Hickey, used to have this he they had
[SPEAKER_04]: the original Hayes and it was so dank and
so like almost cat pissy and turpinoline
[SPEAKER_04]: rich and frankincensey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was it took like 16 to 18 weeks to
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people just really,
you know, when you're breaking the law and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're facing jail, it's this how much can
I get and how fast can I get mentality
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, people thought we were
nuts growing something that took 16 to 18
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks to flower yet when it was burning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could you could hone in on someone in
a busy club with that Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd literally like I just had people
attach themselves to me like, is that the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes you're smoking?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was as distinctive as Kush in
terms of the smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just different.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt on the East Coast, we had the
Washington Heights Hayes, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: commonly on the street called the PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: The PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, you know, that that was
historically the one, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you were grabbing the PIF, you were the
one in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wanted to be close to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, remember the Katsu, though it was
a whole coffee shop in Amstel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the Katsu is still around.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gunkman Sam and I went there in March when
I was in Holland for the International.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those raw, deep, old school Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went right past the counter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went right to the back room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We linked up with the owner and he pulled.
[SPEAKER_04]: He pulled his personal stash out of his
pocket and was hitting us with bong rips
[SPEAKER_04]: of some quite lovely resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: But was it for sale at the Katsu?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, do they still have the Hayes menu at
the Katsu?
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some Hayes menus.
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't interested in flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went right for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, Sam, do you remember what the
owner of the Katsu pulled out of his pipe
[SPEAKER_04]: that we smoked in March?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that a Hayes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that something exotic?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can barely remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you were with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, that was Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He pulled it out because it was special
and he knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he certainly did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was actually in awe of Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that how long has the Katsu
been there, first of all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's been there as long as I can
remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe 30 years or at least 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you waited 25 years to go into the
Katsu and meet the owner?
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been there a couple of times,
but I don't go to coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go to coffee shops to buy wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, what a funny
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man and Skunk Man Sam walking into
the Katsu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the owner here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he have anything special in his
pocket?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we didn't ask the owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked somebody who was working there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, why don't you get the owner?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says, he doesn't want to be
bothered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, well, why don't you just ask him
anyway?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he came out and was gushy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he really was stoked on Skunk Man
Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome Mojo, who just popped into
the room as well as Gargamel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, big up, Mojo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, how about Gargamel back on the
island?
[SPEAKER_04]: Buju, free him up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buju's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time him off the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you unfamiliar, Buju Bantan
was released from prison and is back in
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, if the Jamaican people did not
look so stoked to have him back.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was he in prison for?
[SPEAKER_04]: He was actually in prison, not for
anything good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was for the cocaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he was entrapped or caught with
cocaine, maybe deserved to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody needs no.
[SPEAKER_10]: All drugs should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop fronting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I agree with you, but using
cocaine, that's a serious sign of
[SPEAKER_06]: stupidity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be drug prejudice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ain't used cocaine for 25 years,
but what do you want to do on the weekend
[SPEAKER_10]: to do whatever?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a fuck if you shoot heroin,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All those potheads are still drug
prejudice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send all my cocaine friends over to
your house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the options, you know,
so I got the option.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the option.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the option not to hang out with you,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you have crackhead cocaine friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any crackhead cocaine
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither is my brother that you're
speaking about that deserves to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the situation is, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be like, oh, you deserve to be in
jail without knowing the full situation is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of presumptuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, my question is, why do you got
crackhead cocaine friends?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have any crackhead or
cocaine friends at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if I know somebody is using coke,
even occasionally recreationally,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of I've never seen them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's some strong opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I I'm more of the of the feeling
like I saw the whole Buju thing play out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the footage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I still felt deep down and I don't
know Buju at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends that are friends with him,
but I've appreciated his music a lot over
[SPEAKER_04]: the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just felt like there I don't know
why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the conspiracy person in me,
but I just always feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: society wants to take down the black man
who gains power and who gains a voice for
[SPEAKER_04]: himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just felt like there was some like
shenanigans going on, like maybe Buju was
[SPEAKER_04]: entrapped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there was some sketchiness going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that he's out personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will absolutely be at the first
concert that I can be at that he's that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's playing at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's in Jamaica personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a beautiful, beautiful
thing when he hits the stage again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, all those two mean just stay
positive, stay tuned and let love live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going on in this forum here?
[SPEAKER_04]: This forum is pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what we do is we get together
almost every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a spur of the moment thing
when I was able to YouTube stream live and
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of sort of friends in the
industry and I started inviting them in
[SPEAKER_04]: and we just started having dialogue,
true dialogue, you know, like just like
[SPEAKER_04]: what just happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little bit of opinions that clash,
maybe some some information and some
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to go deep down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is almost always our topic of us,
you know, the source topic here,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it is into the chemistry of
cannabis or the growing and the breeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: the extraction and the processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today was kind of, you know,
after talking to Alex, I thought it was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of a neat idea to have, you know,
have some musicians come in that have had
[SPEAKER_04]: an influence from cannabis over the years
of their of their career and just discuss,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cannabis and music.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell everyone is you go ahead,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give an introduction.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Morgan Heritage, you know,
you know, legends, the the Morgan family,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, they're really one of the really
the biggest rock band in the world and
[SPEAKER_10]: that these cats go play stadiums in Africa
with like thirty thousand cats.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're just they're revered all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just super honored that that
you're here, Mojo.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd actually like to hear what you
guys are up to right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: What one with with Morgan Heritage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we just released the the Africa
Jamaica single featuring Diamond
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum's from Tanzania is, you know,
a multi award winner MTV Europe Awards and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like the probably the
biggest African artist coming out of East
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa and also featuring Stormboy from
Ghana, arguably the biggest artist coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Ghana right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was what I it's funny, but,
you know, we were we were successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gained success in the early 2000s and
there was no social media at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had messenger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know all about it, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I forgot Jamaica for us was
probably our first viral hit, like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of numbers that we released on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we experienced it with Diamond
Platinum's last year with a song called
[SPEAKER_01]: Hallelujah that did a million views in 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different world today.
[SPEAKER_10]: How they consume music and how and how
would you know, you want to just talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about a little bit about like just I mean,
obviously you guys are your fathers from
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are from Jamaica and New York,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you kind of you have a you have an
interesting take on like the weed culture
[SPEAKER_10]: that you get from from from yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have the weed culture from
New York.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you want to just tell us how that
affected you and maybe any like
[SPEAKER_10]: differences or similarities between the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, being born in Brooklyn,
New York, you weed is not so herbal wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: something anyway, you know, was the way it
is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about people going to jail,
what they call the trap in the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call gates in New York,
you know, Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go pick up a nickel bag, a dime bag and
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the growth, you know,
even now in the state of New York that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can walk into a pharmacy and get
herb legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, a full full, full 180
degrees, like about fierce, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world is different right now in
regards to how people view herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that, you know,
is cliche or only to niche only apply a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain image because you have the Wall
Street guys, you have the college
[SPEAKER_01]: students, you have the prep is the up is
the Latinos, the African Americans,
[SPEAKER_01]: the island people, the Africans.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how's that different than in Jamaica in
terms?
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we see it's mad accepted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I live on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You go to an office party on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are smoking weed with their like
cohorts.
[SPEAKER_10]: It ain't no thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Jamaica, you know, you guys have
this kind of this English Commonwealth
[SPEAKER_10]: history and, you know, it's like in
Amsterdam, you know, when I lived there 20
[SPEAKER_10]: years ago and weed was, you know,
quasi legal and all my friends were
[SPEAKER_10]: smoking and all this smoke in the coffee
shop, some bars you can even smoke in.
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, weed was still stigmatized by
the mainstream Dutch culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you couldn't smoke at an office party
in Holland 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I got kicked off a train smoking
some weed once in Holland and you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and and I'd smoked all over in
trains in Europe, never done.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got kicked off and the Dutch were mad.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm wondering if there's any of that
like English Commonwealth overflow,
[SPEAKER_10]: this kind of proper thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Jamaica, where, you know, you have
their ass down one side and then you have,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you have your your your your
political class and business class and the
[SPEAKER_10]: other.
[SPEAKER_10]: What go on in J.A.
[SPEAKER_10]: right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, in Jamaica, even when we
moved to Jamaica in the late 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: the vibe there was, you know, very
tolerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was tolerated, you know,
on low levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only body that was being persecuted
for weed in the 90s was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that was being obvious with it,
you know, where the police can see them or
[SPEAKER_01]: they get caught with it in their car.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, you you can smoke
weed freely in Jamaica for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, even before now, you know,
20 years later, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there are shops where
people can walk in and it's and purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the funny thing about it is just like
Brooklyn, it was deemed to be a niche
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, you know, where it was something
done by uptown people just like in in
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a more affluent drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never a thing in the hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody in the hood sniffing cocaine in
Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it was when crack was
introduced that it got crazy, but people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke marijuana always in the hood in
Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the same thing in Jamaica and
nobody in a country, a sniff cook,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, I heard a man smoke a
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But uptown people used to do it to,
you know, in their privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the culture has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The culture has just completely changed
now, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not too different from what
happened in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say that there are shops in Jamaica
where you can leave legally by
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that it changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the law passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I don't know about three years
now, but they weren't selling it
[SPEAKER_06]: recreationally medically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, recreationally, not legally lost as
we're distributing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were sort of quasi allowed to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen a legal shop selling
recreational markets in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I would have to I just
contacted Bird Eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to be in the nomads and he owns a
spot in Mo Bay called Island Vibes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, whether it's under the the medical
cannabis banner or whether it's under a
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational banner, I'm not 100 percent
sure, but I'm pretty sure anyone over 18
[SPEAKER_04]: or 19 can go into his shop and buy herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty it's it's pretty loose in
the sense of and like Mojo was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not like the island was ever like a
real it was only at roadblocks and
[SPEAKER_04]: airports and like police stations that you
kind of had to be really careful about
[SPEAKER_04]: herb and pretty much anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'll never forget in my life
driving through a cane field with my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend Vincent.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was about nineteen ninety five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm driving through a cane field to get to
a place.
[SPEAKER_04]: What place was that roaring river between
Savlimar and and Negril and beautiful,
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful place with beautiful people and
beautiful food and just like one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite places.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love roaring river.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but I was going through a cane field
and Vincent was leading the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was two or three o'clock
in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that straight up, you know,
three o'clock roadblock sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see the roadblock and it's this
little kind of gravel road and they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, down in the middle of the cane
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get up so close.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see the expressions on their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he basically stops me and he says,
you know, he says, hey, you got weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, I got weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, well, throw it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, right here, they're looking
at us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, just throw it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I throw it out on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kind of we keep driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get almost right to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he does like a 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do a 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cops are like staring at us like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we turn back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes over to my herb and picks it up
and gives it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we and he says to me,
I know a better way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we start driving the in the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, holy shit, dude,
like where I'm from, those cops would have
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hailed us down and shook us down,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe they just stood there
like at the roadblock.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just like, whatever,
man, if you're not going to go past,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't have a problem with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They watched us throw a baggie on the side
of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, fucking jobless Jamaica is all I
can say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember me and Rob Clark were driving
out of Kitama.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had rented a car and we were driving out
of Kitama and we were going down to the
[SPEAKER_06]: coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rob says, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: We had ground up 100 kilos of weed and
made 150 grams of the best Moroccan hash
[SPEAKER_06]: you've ever seen in your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had half of it in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: He threw it out the fucking window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, I put the metal to the, my foot to the
floor and just sped right past the cops
[SPEAKER_06]: and just waved at them as I went by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to hear stories
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people have to know for all the
horrible, like locked up stories for all
[SPEAKER_04]: the like nightmares, like, you know,
that's what I liked about Noel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever talk to Noel Van Shaik?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of you guys in regards to his story of
escaping, like Spanish authorities and
[SPEAKER_04]: like jumping off a giant wall into the
fucking ocean?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also Eddie from Flying Dutchman had a
similar story from France.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all have, I'll have stories
even in, even in America, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's like a lot of, I mean, I have stories
where I've been, I've been caught with
[SPEAKER_10]: weed by cops and been shook down,
been arrested.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have stories where I've been caught
with weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one time I used to, I used to
work a lot with, I still do with the hip
[SPEAKER_10]: hop group Hieroglyphics from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was doing a little tour with Souls
of Mischief, God, 20 years ago in the,
[SPEAKER_10]: in the, on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was driving them around like Ms.
Daisy, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had this big, like whatever,
like Dodge caravan or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like 20 years ago, at least,
actually it was more than 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was, we were going up to Portland to
do a show at the Roseland theater.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and I was going about 85 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember 22 years ago, 85 miles an hour
was, was even faster than it is now,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, or, you know, contextually.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and these cops caught us and we were
just smoking blunts like crazy,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They was just going, I was smoking Euro
trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to get them into Euro trash
style instead of smoking the nasty Swisher
[SPEAKER_10]: suite or the big aloe, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was saying, just put a little organic
tobacco in your mix.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and then, but, but, you know,
that's a different flavor, a different
[SPEAKER_10]: taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: People need to get used to it or not.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, maybe I was just being a bad
influence, but, but they was already
[SPEAKER_10]: smoking blunts.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was like, anyway, we were,
we were, the spot was blown up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like full Dutch oven in the,
in the car and we got caught going 85,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and I was just like,
Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the cops one, two, there was two cops
and one of them Super Ranger Rick,
[SPEAKER_10]: but he wasn't the, he wasn't the senior
officer, but he was re he was ready to
[SPEAKER_10]: bust skulls, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was, you could just tell he was,
he was ready, but his homeboy,
[SPEAKER_10]: his partner who had the authority,
he was, he was hella cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we get caught going 85 over the smoke
pouring out and shade.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, where are you guys going?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, Oh yeah, we're going to the
Roseland theater to do a show or a group,
[SPEAKER_10]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, and I thought we, I thought it
was like step out the car, everything like
[SPEAKER_10]: this.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, I'll go back to the car,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it goes back to the car, comes back and
he gives me a warning ticket.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says, Oh, you know, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just looked at it and I said to him,
literally I was, it was the stupidest
[SPEAKER_10]: un-Jedi I and I thing I ever said in my
life.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, you're letting us go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my boys are like, shut the fuck up and
go.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we all have stories where it's
like, it's just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the authoritarian system, the institution,
the Babylon system.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can, you can fall into it or you can,
if there's no method, it's to the madness.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, it could be arbitrary at
times, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we all have these stories where
we got caught by cops and with weed and
[SPEAKER_10]: got, and got let go.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then we all have the other stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got caught in France after I met Marcus
at the high times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was done a tour, a European tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had met the guys at the blue
dolphin cafe and they said, Hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: you still got your gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to play the high times for 20
party.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we ended up playing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We packed our gear up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said my goodbyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was giving us stuff on the way
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went through to get back to Heathrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the ferry back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got stamped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was stamped.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all on the tour bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember cracking open the blue dolphin
haze starting to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the officer comes and knocks on
the bus and says, turn it around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent the next 12 hours literally
tearing the whole bus apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took all my drum equipment apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took every single bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got me down to my literally nothing,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a, it was a lift the ball
situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I've had that too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had that on the French Swiss border.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, I was strip searched on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: My boy, my, we were in France 20,
me and my boy out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were in France.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was 20 years ago and 19 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, and I had brought some weed to
France and then we ran out and I was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, let's go to Switzerland and get some.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went and we had nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we go on the Swiss border and my boy,
our dog forgot his passport.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, dude, don't we need to go
back?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, no, I've got my, my,
my driver's license where we just,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we just, they'll let me in with
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, word the Swiss.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we get to the border and it's,
it's, it's, and we, and this is kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: similar to your story bubble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and we get out, this motherfucker had
a gram of some super dank shit in his
[SPEAKER_10]: backpack that he had totally forgotten
about from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So lo and behold, they give us some
preliminary search.
[SPEAKER_10]: They find that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next thing you know, they strip search,
right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they put us in this little,
they put me in this little room,
[SPEAKER_10]: our dogs waiting outside all wide eyed and
freaked out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put me in buck naked got to strip
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: They put you on this wall, make you put
your hands like this, not like this,
[SPEAKER_10]: but like this on the wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's dirty fingerprints on the wall
and there's dirty toe prints on the floor
[SPEAKER_10]: where they make every motherfucker stand
to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they said, they said in a,
they were speaking French to me and my
[SPEAKER_10]: French wasn't that good at that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they switched to German and they
were saying, they were saying has to mess
[SPEAKER_10]: up, has to mess up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you got a knife, you got a knife.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said to him, do I look like I
fucking got a knife?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like making me spread my butt cheeks and
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like totally demeaning, horrible.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and then I swear to God,
honest to Pete, this next mug comes in
[SPEAKER_10]: with a glove like this in the door,
like putting the glove on and a meet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew, I was like, Oh, I'm going to
go to jail because this thing happened to
[SPEAKER_10]: me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, and I said to him in my,
in my horrible French, I said,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, uh, to poop, I met her on my interior
and that translates as you can not put in
[SPEAKER_10]: my inside.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and they're like, and they're like,
no, no, no, we're not going to put in the
[SPEAKER_10]: side.
[SPEAKER_10]: But our dog is seeing homeboy come in with
the glove too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So comes in with the glove.
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not go inside.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't going to let them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, I said, and my shitty friend,
no, I walk out the door, our dogs freaked
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I looked at our dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, it's not that bad out dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have just razzed him,
but the situation was so hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have come out like, like,
like, like with a limp and shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, uh, uh, just to, you know,
in hindsight, that would have been such
[SPEAKER_10]: the bomb thing to do, but I didn't,
it was such a serious situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, Al, it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he goes in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: We come back, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We get, we get on in back in the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said, we're not going to let you in.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, come on, let us in,
let us in.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said, we're not going to let you in.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said, come on, let us in,
let us in.
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, okay, we'll let you in just by
the $40 vignette to drive the highways in
[SPEAKER_10]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, okay, bet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we, uh, he, the dude goes and the
customs or the border guy goes and gives
[SPEAKER_10]: this gram back to our dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the same thing happen to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this shit happens in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Europe is, is definitely even more
arbitrary with their, with the
[SPEAKER_10]: constabulary and, uh, uh, but then our
dog's like, Oh, what do you want me to do
[SPEAKER_10]: with it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and, and, uh, uh, and, and the guy
says, I want you to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we're just looking like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So our dog kind of get, he opens up the
car.
[SPEAKER_10]: He takes his little baggie.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a flag pole right out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he goes and he takes his little gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: He, he throws it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the gram falls out and he actually
keeps the baggie.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause he doesn't want to litter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he comes back in the car and they're
like, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we go on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was their disposal.
[SPEAKER_10]: A way of disposal, taking our shit is they
just had our dog go and dump it on the
[SPEAKER_10]: flag pole.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just the weirdest thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after a whole fucking ordeal,
we go into Switzerland and that's a whole
[SPEAKER_10]: other story that I won't get into,
but yeah, that's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy packed the bowl and said,
he pushed it across the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought he was just, look,
I thought I was in a lot of trouble,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say he packed the bowl?
[SPEAKER_05]: He put the put, he put the, the,
he took a little nuggy, put it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pushed it across and I just looked at
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he told me, you know,
it's, it's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: They pitted the whole band against each
other being like, you had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben said, you did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, then of course he
said, you know, that I did it to Ben.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unbelievable, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was, but yeah, they,
they, it's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we were just trying to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Swiss French board, I was in France
and I was going in to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I forget, I think it, I, you know,
I actually forget if it was the,
[SPEAKER_10]: the French customs, I think it was the
Swiss customs because they were switching
[SPEAKER_10]: to German and French, you know,
like, like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty sure it was Swiss customs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The French are just as bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the French are worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was, I was leaving France,
going into Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a t-shirt that had something about
cannabis on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They completely strip searched me and my
wife and we didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're a lucky man because I'm going
through, I'm walking in France,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1999, going to the supermarket,
me and my brothers, and we get stopped by
[SPEAKER_01]: the police acts for our ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, luckily we were, we were on our way to
Western union and had our passports in our
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket, gave them the U S passports and
they're like, Oh no, these are fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go straight Springfield,
Massachusetts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even go Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we were born in Brooklyn and
educated in Springfield, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we switched up on them straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you're telling us that we're not
American sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to go to the U S embassy
and we go straight proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's sad, but that would
what you just said, bro, about them
[SPEAKER_01]: passing the weed back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting harassed in Europe around the
same timeframe, late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro in 2012, I'm in France, going from,
I'm in Switzerland, going from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: From, from, from a part of France,
right next to Switzerland to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to go through France.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird the way the highway.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how it just Geneva, just that tiny
little thing that's basically almost
[SPEAKER_10]: circumscribed by, by, by, by France.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you go into France and you got
to come back and you're going through a
[SPEAKER_01]: border while driving in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go through this checkpoint and we
did not have our passports.
[SPEAKER_01]: We was going to perform had no weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told us to get out of the car,
had no paraphernalia and we had to go
[SPEAKER_01]: inside, give our names, et cetera,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to find us in a database to
prove that we were not Africans trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: illegally migrate to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, I think that's an
interesting thing because, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, when I moved to Europe, you know,
I come from a big city in America,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, I grew up very multi-culturally
and then you go over to Europe and you see
[SPEAKER_10]: how this is 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, it's, it's a little bit different
now, but like we lived in Amsterdam and so
[SPEAKER_10]: the black population in Amsterdam was a
Surinamese and it was, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I was all these black guys
all here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's got, oh, there's some black
culture here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's really different in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's with the Afrikaner, even Suriname is
not Africa.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's South, South South America,
but they were, they were slaves that Dutch
[SPEAKER_10]: took from Africa to take to Suriname a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you realize how the, the Africans,
the Afrikaner massives are treated in
[SPEAKER_10]: Europe versus, versus black culture in
America.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tell a lot of my black friends in
America, Hey, Godi, if you're complaining
[SPEAKER_10]: about America, fucking go to Europe
because it is some straight bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, like, like, yeah, like, and it is
because of the whole African thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they, they just, they, they,
but once they know you're American,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yeah, yeah, they, they knew we were
American just by the way we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I mean, I think you said it
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even till today, because of all the
situations, you know, happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Africa, these little things
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, for the most part,
it don't really be, be, be rolling like
[SPEAKER_01]: that in Europe with cannabis outside of
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you, you, you were extremely
lucky, my friend put it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's been times, well,
I've been in prison at three different
[SPEAKER_10]: prisons in Europe too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so, uh, uh, and there was a time I
went to France from Amsterdam once where I
[SPEAKER_10]: had, I put a ball of hash, like a two
grand ball of hash in my fifth pocket in
[SPEAKER_10]: my Levi's and I get off the train in Paris
and, and this little cute cuddly dog comes
[SPEAKER_10]: up to me and just sits down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, Oh, look at her dog sat down
right next to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then right behind this little dog is a
police officer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, she was, she was, she was,
she was like, do you have any cannabis on
[SPEAKER_10]: you?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_10]: She fully searched me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was only like two grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't that bulgy in my pocket,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: My fifth pocket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, I'm going to search you.
[SPEAKER_10]: She said, do you have any?
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: She says, well, if I find some,
you're going to go to jail tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, no, I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just like, Jedi and I,
Jedi and I, Jedi, and I, and she goes and
[SPEAKER_10]: searches me and she did not find it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, there I was, but that was
just one other time I almost went to
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, the thing about Europe is
they don't need probable.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no such thing as probable cause in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I guess in America, post nine one
one, there ain't, you know, stop and
[SPEAKER_10]: search, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: There ain't no need for probable cause in
America now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you been through the, the,
the Arizona stop, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got stopped there with like literally,
man, I put, I, I like unscrewed the side
[SPEAKER_05]: of the inside of the bus and like split
stuff, two ounces in a Turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had like four dogs on the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and they, they took us all the whole
band off of us, search all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they didn't find anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a picture with the dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just was like, but I don't know if
you've been through there, but that was
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the, every time we knew it,
man, we knew we were going to get singled
[SPEAKER_05]: out and they just, they're just like pull
over.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is in, in Holland in Amsterdam or
near Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so folks had a lot of cannabis burning
in greenhouses a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean tons.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had to transport it to the
manicuring and drying because they didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to dry it, manicured on site.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not so a safe thing to do to bring so
many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an entire large van.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a big van with a few hundred large
boxes, each one with freshly harvested
[SPEAKER_06]: branches, you know, a couple of kilos in
each box.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're driving down the street or on the
freeway and they get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_06]: The driver gets pulled over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's going off.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen now?
[SPEAKER_06]: The cops immediately, as soon as he got
close to the van, he opened up the back
[SPEAKER_06]: door.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looked inside of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just wrote, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He closed the door and he goes,
well, I'm just going to let you go this
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't want to do all the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Dutch cops are mad cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a few Dutch cops thinking I was
going down for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Dutch cops are definitely Well,
you got to remember that Dutch cops until
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe the last 10 years, they were allowed
to legally smoke cannabis when they
[SPEAKER_06]: weren't on duty.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing that prohibited it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's prohibited by law.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that because of the pressure from the
Christian conservative government?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who put the pressure on,
but Holland, the last decade has gotten
[SPEAKER_06]: worse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think, you know, we all have,
we all have the, like I said, we all have
[SPEAKER_10]: those stories and there's no method to the
madness.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the Babylon system is just like
legalize all drugs because it's just a way
[SPEAKER_10]: to take control over people's lives.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, those, those cops didn't
cares.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were strip searching us after they
found the gram and has to mess up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have knife?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have knife?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's just like they just power
corrupts, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get little, little ranger ricks in
that, in that, in that position.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and, you know, all I can say is thank
God for constabulary discretion because,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, that discretion is what makes
you go down.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you get a bad cop or, or, or stay out,
keep your freedom.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you got a good cop and, you know,
I'm not, you know, I'm, I'm a public
[SPEAKER_10]: policy geek.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I guess my, my degree is
actually political science, but,
[SPEAKER_10]: but, you know, there's legalizing all
drugs all over the world is the way to
[SPEAKER_10]: combat that situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably even more importantly,
Alex, that reason would be the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: like just here in Vancouver alone,
1400 overdoses last year, all,
[SPEAKER_04]: all like dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were many, many more overdoses that
didn't die, but those are all the ones who
[SPEAKER_04]: passed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's an epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many of those are on legal drugs
and not heroin?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those are on fentanyl and
well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Inevitably Mark, it was always fentanyl or
car fentanyl, but the person always didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's part of the keeping the drugs
illegal thing that like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's the whole thing that Alex
mentioned, but then there's the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect of public safety.
[SPEAKER_10]: The number one drug researcher in America,
Dr. Carl Hart from Columbia university.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is a very interesting character.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's actually the first black tenured
professor for Columbia.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that shows how long, how far we
still need to come, but, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: he's a real interesting cat.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's the one that you look at what his
studies say, or what, what he espouses is,
[SPEAKER_10]: is clearly, uh, drugs do need to be legal
to, and then you'll have fewer deaths
[SPEAKER_10]: because he says the two main reasons
people overdose are that the it's,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's either adulterated or they're mixing
it with something that they clearly
[SPEAKER_10]: shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you get it from us, when you get
some heroin from a street dealer,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not going to be like, Oh,
don't mix this with fentanyl or,
[SPEAKER_10]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some people are still going to,
you know, have overdoses and do,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, that shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, it's a big world, but,
uh, uh, but that shit's in way more than
[SPEAKER_04]: just heroin, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put it in, they put it in all sorts
of powdered drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a word for the wise too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this happened last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a band called dark star orchestra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're a grateful dead band that
plays reproduced grateful dead shows from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from years gone by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say this was in Providence,
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was somewhere out here out
East.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure, but, um,
they stopped the show after the first set
[SPEAKER_00]: and the band left and they empty the venue
because there were four overdoses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone was passing around a fentanyl
laced vape pen, you know, and when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: at a music venue and someone passes you a
vape pen, you're like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: vape, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure people just care free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you almost have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's vape pen you suck off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have fentanyl in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to suck off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's vape pen except for real.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, I brought that whole suck off on
the, um, the other person's vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think vape pens should be a personal
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not opposed to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just try and the flavor one hit
from your homie that being a boy for 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years, it's a different type of vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Joe, why don't you tell us,
you got, you got a new single out,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: With Steven Marley.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it the other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was ill dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: That Bob Marley sample is, is,
is retarded.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you want to tell us about,
uh, uh, your new single a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be free that, you know, we talking about
certain elements within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and the hemp industry and the
growth over the years, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: continues in a lot of different parts of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a single, uh, it's a, it's the first
single from my upcoming solo debut album,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, called be free featuring Steven Marley
and my brother, James Morgan from the
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, we said, let them lead
the rebellion.
[SPEAKER_01]: One billion soldiers full of conviction,
determination to rock the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caution to each and every nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an invasion of the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diamond can't polish without some friction
children to what you've been learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years ago, some talking new teachers
can open doors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You cut out there for me, Mojo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who got the master plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: No honey, no work, no money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoulders to the wheel and let's get
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you listen to that song,
it's a call for the, for, for the
[SPEAKER_01]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Walking down the right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Steven sings that right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that it was four minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that it was four minutes and 20
seconds long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the remix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the J vibe remix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a Naya being a version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one sorts of puts you in a trance
where the original version, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: we sample caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whalers album called the best of the
whalers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coincidentally, um, it's a song that Bob
Marley sang lead on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we had Steven sing over his dad's
part in the record and Graham sang chorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, call if for freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we speak about the transition,
the world is making right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with cannabis and the hemp industry,
there's still a lot of places where people
[SPEAKER_01]: are still being locked up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that song is for those types of people
and freedom fighters, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all around the globe because it is still a
struggle as we can.
[SPEAKER_10]: The battle's just begun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much, how much they're still fighting
it, you know, the, the, whoever the
[SPEAKER_04]: agenda, the governments, they just seem to
be fighting this plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tooth and nail last down to the last.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mojo.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got some problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have, you, you, you still doing the
CBD water and, uh, you got anything new
[SPEAKER_10]: products or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mojo, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The family has this, um, Graham's has this
CBD line and that's the thing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're focused on a lot right now
is the CBD element of the, this gold rush,
[SPEAKER_01]: the green rush, you know, and,
um, I think it's important that in
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying the recreational benefits and
highlighting that and talking about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to really highlight and talk about
the medicinal benefits and how the
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative to cannabis you know,
is a sister called hemp that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't come with the cycle, uh,
components that do it and the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits far exceed that THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, even though we know cannabis
come with, with CBD, I think what my
[SPEAKER_01]: brother got a bad connection is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, his mom being a scientist
for the U S government and them forming,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Aya, um, after she discovered
the benefits of CBD that was derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: him because she couldn't mess with
cannabis, of course, being an employee of
[SPEAKER_01]: the U S government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she really, um, did a great thing when
she created her own tincture and started
[SPEAKER_01]: treating her son.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kid is walking, you know,
at two years, years old, he's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, walking, talking, you know,
one of his eyes was closed down after the
[SPEAKER_01]: surgery, seeing out of both eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that is happening when the
doctor said, don't be surprised if he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't even walk or even make a sound
before seven, eight years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's the thing we can't,
that's why we've just begun, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: people, you know, Rasta say, or about a
healing of the nation, Jack hair,
[SPEAKER_10]: my mentor used to always say, uh,
hemp will save the planet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, and I just saw a quote from
Jack says, I'm not sure if hemp will save
[SPEAKER_10]: the planet, but it's, but it's the only
thing that can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, legitimate investment is now placed
themselves into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's huge multimillion dollar funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid, you not, it's all about control over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who gets to make the money has nothing
to do with really what's best for society.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, nothing ever does, but if you
can monetize certain things, then you can,
[SPEAKER_10]: it still will find the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in Oregon, okay,
let's call a spade a spade.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the DA did is they moved CBD out of
schedule one CBD comes from the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can something that has no medical use
come up with a compound that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is curing these diseases or making
these diseases a lot better?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the people who have them, it's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is medical use for the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been established.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been proven by government funded
studies here, and it's all about the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about John Boehner and acreage
holdings and all those motherfuckers who
[SPEAKER_00]: want the money going their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about, you know, bringing the
herb to the, to reunify humans with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see, you know, I see that in New
York right now, guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's you walk around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's CBD everywhere, misinformed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really care who makes the money?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care who makes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_06]: If herb is legal, that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but what they need to do is they need
to remove cannabis from schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they remove cannabis from schedule one,
a lot of things change, including it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and the biggest, the biggest
fraud, the biggest fraud is that it exists
[SPEAKER_00]: in schedule one, where the definition of
schedule one says no known medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the FDA approve CBD for use on
epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no known benefit benefit,
it's a fucking scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking, it's, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being the choir there, but here's
the, here's the caveat.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they need to de-schedule cannabis,
because if they reschedule cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: then that's just going to give more,
uh, that's going to prop big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove it from the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medicated herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a plan and it should be regulated
as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it becomes, it becomes dangerous that,
you know, when we have all these
[SPEAKER_05]: terminologies moving at a pop culture
level that are really act, that aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: really grabbing ahold of itself at that
academic level, it's, it can be very
[SPEAKER_05]: confusing in the longterm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand, you know, the point of
view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's, it's a tricky one here,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I will agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it here in New York where it's every
corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like three bucks for it in your
coffee, but it's most of the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: not really full spectrum cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it, but to be honest,
I wish every policeman, every highway
[SPEAKER_06]: patrolman, every, uh, prison officer is
able to make lots of money involved with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, growing it legally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can all quit their jobs and
become good doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be really interesting
to see what happens with GW's approval of
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex here in the States, because you
know, the CBD business is, is roaring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genie's out of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toothpaste is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use that because there's a guy on
YouTube who puts toothpaste back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it just, it's all about,
it's all about control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about who controls a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows this is a billion dollar
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm on board with you,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really saying that people
shouldn't make money on it, but I think if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a hypocrisy that exists within the
government today to keep scan of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on schedule one, while they take
Epidiolex, which is nothing more than a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking CBD tincture that costs $35,000 us
a year and move it to schedule five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I, I know the CBD product
that GW produces fairly well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read the variety that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to be the gas station that
does the same fucking thing for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that was another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are the genetics, you know,
is that really what, what they're saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that they have above and beyond
everyone else, Sam is they're saying that
[SPEAKER_05]: they, Hey, listen, we have, we have the
progeny, we have the genetics to make
[SPEAKER_05]: this, this particular type of formulation
that nobody else has access to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it seems to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the product is just a CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the CBD level of the plant is
about 10% manicured buds, dried buds,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it has very low, low THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's 0.0 something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really low.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to fuck everything up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it's all going to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a news flash.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_10]: I produced the biggest business to
business cannabis event in Europe,
[SPEAKER_10]: in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I tell people, so I see it all,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I deal with the big guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I deal with the little guys from the
street to the boardroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how Jedi and I roll, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, and that's just, and I like it
that way, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you keep your ear to everyone's,
everyone's cipher, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I tell folks when I, when I,
when I get up at the beginning to kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: just bring the narrative, you know,
create a narrative that, that's more like
[SPEAKER_10]: on, on my level, as I say, every,
your administrators, your politicians,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is what I said the very first time in
Germany, and they were taken aback,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they had to hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, your politicians, your
administrators are going to fuck
[SPEAKER_10]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's clear.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to, they're going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, the most important thing is,
and this is what I tell when I go into a
[SPEAKER_10]: brand new market, like Germany was,
especially when we did the first ICBC in
[SPEAKER_10]: Berlin, I said, the most important thing
is that we end criminal penalties towards
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis and you have a, everyone can have
a robust home garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they legalize cannabis, you know,
and then you don't have, and, and,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you can't have a home garden,
then the fight is not over, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they legalize cannabis and criminal
penalties are ended and you can have a
[SPEAKER_10]: robust home garden, then I'm in for
whatever's clever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Oregon is a, Oregon's a great example
of, of, of that where not only we had,
[SPEAKER_10]: have we reduced like heavily, like I
could, somebody could sell someone a pound
[SPEAKER_10]: on the street in Oregon, not have a
license or anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not a felony, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is what I've got to see this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to, I've been fortunate enough to
live in Oregon and see this microcosmic
[SPEAKER_10]: utopian example of what's going on with
the, with cannabis in terms of that ending
[SPEAKER_10]: criminal penalties, robust home garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I use that as an analogy when I,
when I travel around the world and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and talk to people, because I,
you know, you can, you can talk about the,
[SPEAKER_10]: the, the ins and outs and how it's going
to be, but you know, that's going to,
[SPEAKER_10]: that a nickel might get you a cup of
coffee.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for me, it's like break it down to the,
you know, get rootical on things and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and say, what's really important.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for me, home garden, ending criminal
penalties, the conversation ends there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even though I am a cannabis business
person, I look at things, I look at,
[SPEAKER_10]: because I'm a disciple of Jack Hare,
I look at things from a consumer
[SPEAKER_10]: perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I just look at things from the
average mug.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in Oregon now you can get top weed for
like two bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And all the growers are complaining,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't care because all that money
was made off of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, what I care about is getting the
best product for the best price.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was 20, I was buying $400 ounces in
Northern Cali and I was feeling like a
[SPEAKER_10]: drug addict because I was, I was buying
the weed before I'd buy my fucking bread,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was dread, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what go on now in Oregon, everybody,
everybody can smoke, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't got us.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can have their own home garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know multiple cats who aren't in the
weed game, but have their, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: four plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what I would call a robust
garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to make that more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you can get your medical marijuana
card and grow like 12, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, and that's just like a couple hundred
bucks more.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, I know a million people who are
just growing, they look at ice shuns and
[SPEAKER_10]: then they're just, they got the whole
whole years worth of ice shuns from their
[SPEAKER_10]: four plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause we have such a great growing climate
out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, so basically that's what I tell
folks all around the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's going to fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that it's not a newsflash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are we going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule one listing of cannabis is really
hurting Oregon in the following way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon produces way more herb than they
could possibly smoke as a single state
[SPEAKER_00]: populace.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when cannabis is no longer on
schedule one and we could do state to
[SPEAKER_00]: state commerce, Oregon's going to be a
major player in producing quality herb
[SPEAKER_00]: that can go all over the country is not
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a schedule one hang up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically keeping Oregon's industry
in the dump and, and making growers be
[SPEAKER_00]: poor that where they can't, you know,
afford their bills, can't afford to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who've gotten out of the
cannabis industry in Oregon because the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation was so crazy that they were
going to, they were going to lose all
[SPEAKER_00]: their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Regulations are crazy because it's easy to
get in the game in Oregon, but it's harder
[SPEAKER_10]: than sell your weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you grow it, because all the big
grows and scaled and now it's 300 bucks a
[SPEAKER_10]: pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, you're correct that when,
when, when, when, when it's, when it's
[SPEAKER_10]: rescheduled or de-scheduled, then there
will be a whole nother conduit.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, there's a big, uh, I'm supporting
a big, uh, uh, bill that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: get past that already does that and,
and allows for Oregon to, to export.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it is, so when the government does
give the okay, that Oregon will be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: hit the ground running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, I'll probably, you hit the
nail on the head exactly why the CBD rush
[SPEAKER_00]: is going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the reasons why people are
growing CBD, even in legal States is
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have a much larger addressable
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more likely to be profitable if
you're growing CBD, because you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, basically sell those products
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of my boys adapted who are
just growers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they got, now they got acres of
fucking hemp and just on the CBD and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not as regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, uh, it was a great pivot for
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing that in New York,
in New York state and Massachusetts now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have a, uh, a license in
Massachusetts and you know, that market in
[SPEAKER_05]: itself is so different than the West coast
because it's just coming online.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a new time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's, you know, it, I see us go,
you know, the Massachusetts market going
[SPEAKER_05]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's going to drop once everybody
comes online and it's an inevitable
[SPEAKER_05]: balance balancing act that we have to play
at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, uh, you know, we have a lot to
learn from each other all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Hey, I want to thank Mojo for
coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he's got a split here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got an email from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks a lot Mojo for, uh, we'll check
out your song for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I've been listening to it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, hope to link with the eye one day
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your mojo working, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the mojo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you got your mojo working?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am because I'm listening to you,
my brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a joy hanging out with all you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jedi and I, Alex, thank you for making
that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Marcus, you've been an awesome host
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the new music, um, Africa,
Jamaica by Amargan heritage available on
[SPEAKER_01]: all streaming and platforms and download
platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for be free, um, featuring Steven
Marley, Gramps Morgan by myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mojo Morgan, and the remix drops this
coming Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I are being good vibes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and let's do it again soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that song that you sent me,
is it, uh, copyrighted by you?
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is, but it isn't released yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do, if you play it, it,
it, it's not gonna, um, spike.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to lose the show because
they usually strike those shows off the
[SPEAKER_04]: channel, but I would love to play the
song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing won't happen, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if something does happen,
we might be getting in touch with your
[SPEAKER_04]: production company to send an email to
YouTube on my behalf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We independent, uh, word.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you gotta be now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when I end the show within the,
I'm probably going to end in the next 45
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll, uh, I'll play it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play out the show with the song.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks Mojo.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannabis Morgan heritage, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys know,
but like the father of the Morgan heritage
[SPEAKER_04]: had like, was it like 40 children?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's got, he's got more than 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he has a lot of children.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, uh, that are all super talented.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I gotta say whatever he did.
[SPEAKER_10]: His, his, his sons, uh, uh, Peta Gramps
and Mojo, they're just the sweetest,
[SPEAKER_10]: most down to earth route.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are the real deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: No fake to the front.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, uh, they've been a pleasure to work
with, uh, over the years for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, you know, I only work with a few
different crews.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I always worked with
hieroglyphics because I was working with a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of hip hop crews.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I realized, I just want to work
with high row because they're just such
[SPEAKER_10]: roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, down to earth folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't say enough about, uh,
the whole Morgan heritage family.
[SPEAKER_04]: 29 children.
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he should have more, quite a few.
[SPEAKER_10]: He breeds the best people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably the thing we don't all have 29
children.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we all can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the, that's the spice of life
on this planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have three and that I'm pretty
overwhelmed with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I got one breaking my balls on the
daily lover to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two 16 and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, it's, it, the problems only
get bigger when they get older.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not true, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've got one 35 and one 41 and
problems get less every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, there's all the problems between 20
and 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it figure your shit out time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in figure your shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A parabolic function, you know,
as it closed as, as, as, as age increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become less dependent on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but you know, when they're young,
it's it, you know, being a parent is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it certainly takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: My girls were never dependent on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to, as soon as they could move
out and get on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got your, they got your must've been
that skunk smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Must've been the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually walk around my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the kids, the kids who hippies
who, who, who never smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that smell dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, uh, I was complaining about the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: They both worked at my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in an area of Pennsylvania where
there's a lot of mushrooms, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the little white button mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you know how those are
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically grow on sawdust and horse
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about Canada square,
Pennsylvania, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew that place really well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so one day I walked into my
chiropractor's office who had an open
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the patients were everyone on there
and the smell was just so thick outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I walked into the office,
I'm like, Oh God, that mushroom smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't realize, but one of the
patients was an owner of a mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked up off the chiropractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked up at me and said, you smell
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, that's the smell of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are characters, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those mushroom farmers are good people
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well they, they hire boatloads of Mexicans
that come up and work those mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: houses because again, I don't know anybody
else who would possibly do that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some good outdoor region too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that part, that's particular part of
Pennsylvania is really good for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when that bill came online,
there's a lot, a lot of being grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of hemp being grown in Pennsylvania,
you know, not too far from where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like the cradle of the hemp
industry during the 13 colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe William Penn taxed his farmers
for not growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you didn't grow hemp, cause what did
her majesty need to conquer the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: She needed ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ships are driven on sails and ropes
and everything else that can be derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see a company coming back
to Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting in an application to grow a
hundred acres next year at my friend's
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we're going to start putting it
into food, into dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to just, I believe CBD is the
vitamin C of the future and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from baby formula to geriatric medicine
and everything in between will be
[SPEAKER_00]: fortified with CBD in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be scum man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam's biggest nightmare.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a real fan for personal use,
but I was happy enough to develop the
[SPEAKER_06]: first high CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's all your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it's useful for people and if they
enjoy it and it's useful for them,
[SPEAKER_06]: more, you know, different smokes for
different folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it was in everything and you could
no longer get high?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, then I think I would, uh, not put a
new thermonuclear device.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do you think, do you think CBD Sam
has been something that we've just
[SPEAKER_05]: overlooked for a long time and it's just
been under our noses the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there a particular reason why we
didn't study it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I developed my variety more than 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were looking into CBD before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been there a lot longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: To produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get more than 22% from him,
but there's varieties that produce more
[SPEAKER_06]: than 25%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I guess just for sacred
conversation, you know, cause it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: single species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's a true mutation of this
cannabis Steve L or is it, is it something
[SPEAKER_05]: that, um, that really is bred and selected
or is it really, you know, how does,
[SPEAKER_05]: how does, you know, when you were first
starting with that, I just started
[SPEAKER_05]: curiosity.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get down to the selection
process?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with the breeding, with the breeding
program, I was able to create varieties
[SPEAKER_06]: that were pure CBD, pure THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the easy one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of farmers have done that worldwide
for years, but also CBC, CBG, THCB,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, CBGB, CBCV.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can produce with breeding plants that
basically produce large amounts of only
[SPEAKER_06]: one single plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the biochemical basis for that is
the fact that those different varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: have different expression levels of the
synthases that are the basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular machinery in the plant that
actually make those, those final
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases, there's what are
called knockouts where the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that the, the gene codes for the
protein that's made from it, or the enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: that's made, there's like a mutation
that's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason now you have a
dysfunction functional enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, Sam has always
said that about, about CBD synthase in
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it's dysfunctional for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's non-functional.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-functional in other varieties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other varieties, those, those
synthases are up-regulated at the expense
[SPEAKER_00]: of other synthases being down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the genome is really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark is also that all varieties do not
have all the synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got to have the synthase
expressed in large amounts like you're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus you need the sites of production,
res and flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then on the, on the topic of
enzyme production, did you see any
[SPEAKER_05]: enzymatic biotransformation of terpenes,
um, as bioactive agents overall,
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning the way that they, they change in
the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid pathway in and of itself
answers your question.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid pathway involves the
marriage of a, of a, of a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor with a phenol that essentially
makes CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that answers your question right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the biochemical transformation
that happens in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway is, is terpene
driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terpene driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to, cause I've been reading
a bunch about the, the environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: impact on, on terpenes as a chemical
defense, uh, of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, you know, the expressions in
which they all, uh, you know, each
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar can express that, you know,
at different times during the growth cycle
[SPEAKER_05]: is, um, of extreme interest of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, that said, you really need the
basic synthase to produce whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene, whether it's a synthase to
produce limolene, a synthase to produce
[SPEAKER_06]: mersene, or it's a terpene that,
uh, it is a secondary terpene that's based
[SPEAKER_06]: on the, uh, mersene production or the
limolene production as some of the other
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you might know more about that than
me, Mark, because, uh, I, I see it from a
[SPEAKER_06]: practical hands-on plant point of view,
whereas you understand the chemistry much
[SPEAKER_06]: better than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That got deep fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking Greek to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one more question, I guess,
to Mark is, um, so, and I guess Sam too
[SPEAKER_05]: is, so CB, CBG production is, is the
first, from my understanding, the very
[SPEAKER_05]: first one that, that is, is the birther of
the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and now there's extreme interest in
isolating this, um, in terms of,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, of breeding and expressions,
you know, have you ever truly seen a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't, that doesn't just go on
immediately to express other, other,
[SPEAKER_05]: other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: We bred more than a decade ago,
uh, CBG only varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's, you know, I've seen very
little of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any cannabinoid that you can think of,
we've already bred varieties that express
[SPEAKER_06]: only that cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we started by plant breeding
techniques, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: By plant breeding, not by engineering.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said by plant breeding, by traditional
plant breeding techniques, not by,
[SPEAKER_00]: not by genetic engineering work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we should identify the genome and
you know, the gene that codes for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain synthase, you could basically
knock at knock that out and then express
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's engineered.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about CRISPR or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess that's a whole, that's a whole
other conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a GMO kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, I'm a classical plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've always been.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'll always be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work, right, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people talk about, you know,
producing cannabinoids of yeast and all
[SPEAKER_06]: this kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow a fucking plant that yields
you two kilos of flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 25% target.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to try to do it cheaper
in a, in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard they were trying to grow,
grow terpenes as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just doesn't make much sense,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, I held beakers full of,
uh, yeast that express CBD or THC or both,
[SPEAKER_06]: or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be done, but is it cheaper?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's cheaper on the point of scaling
up huge vats to basically brew
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids like we brew beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not so sure it's cheaper than
growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine growing hemp how cheap that is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're doing that with a THC
variety or with a CBG variety,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's pretty darn cheap, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is that, you know, a lot of
things are made in this world by
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citric acid is a perfect example of a
product that's made on multi-ton scale by
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fermentation is just,
it's a way of using things like yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes to basically carry out chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically biochemistry as
opposed to traditional chemistry where you
[SPEAKER_00]: add chemicals to get things to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think it's a great advance that
they've actually done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, the cannabinoid pathway
expression in yeast, just a great
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific achievement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, if that does produce and they
could basically now just have five story,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge stainless steel vats of yeast that
are cooking away and, and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and making cannabinoids, you know,
at the end of the day, can that be made
[SPEAKER_00]: less expensive than the traditional
growing, extracting, and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting one cannabinoid from the
yeast pathway, as opposed to several
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids you would get in a
cannabis extract, it could actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: more economical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's what everybody's
saying, but I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I work with a, I work with a couple of
terpene companies and I work with a bunch
[SPEAKER_10]: of terpene companies, but a couple of them
are, are strictly non-cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're, they're big terpene companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't mention their names, but they're,
they're, they're fully non-cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just found that out at MJViz when I was
there a couple of weeks ago and I was
[SPEAKER_10]: talking to some, going around talking to
some preferred clients.
[SPEAKER_10]: By any chance, are they from Israel?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that, not this, not this too,
that I would, particularly that I was
[SPEAKER_10]: speaking with.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might get their shit from me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how they make it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're non-cannabis terpene companies at
the MJVizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're non-cannabis terpene companies at
the MJVizCon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll link nicely with the non-cannabis
yeast growing CBD and THC companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can be the future of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of shit grown on yeast and
some fucking swag fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus, what we need to come up with is
the non-MJVizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the people who aren't in the
cannabis industry and those fuckers can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to Vegas and go lose their money one
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of phytochemicals that we
just don't know about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I, you know, I just, I think that
we've, those types of things, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: it just clouds everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we have those guys coming into these
B2B things, because people like you're
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, the non-cannabis people get
swooned by the non-cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall call them yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall call them yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow like a fungus.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time that I saw cannabis being
expressed in yeast was actually it was in
[SPEAKER_06]: tobacco roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about 20, 25 years ago by some work
done by Shoyama, a Japanese scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the writing was on the wall that
people were going to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were trying to grind all
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tobacco root was expressing THC,
but actually he'd only moved part of what
[SPEAKER_06]: he needed to move.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had to feed it CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even the yeast groups that are
growing synthetic cannabinoids need to
[SPEAKER_04]: also feed CBGA?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can also, if you put in the whole
chain, then it will first produce CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it will produce from CBG,
whatever you want, THC or CBD or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fully engineered, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they engineered the pathway right into
the modified yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a genetically modified yeast
that's doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Including terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can express the terpene yield and
expression and profile with the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And will it just be like dank yeast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you just be like, this yeast is so
dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the loudest, it's like what's in your
pocket?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some yeast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell the weed on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're rolling around five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's my yeast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sauerkraut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a yeast infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of, yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would say, Sam, that it's truly the
same expression that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: because nature's chemist is one mysterious
chemist, you know, the way that it all
[SPEAKER_05]: comes together off the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, you can't possibly think if you
believe that there are a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_04]: that we maybe have not discovered about
this plant yet, or if there's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, new phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different things going on
that we might not be perceiving is all,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if they found a
whole new class of molecules or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say, but how do we know that
just producing THC and terpenes on yeast
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to yield the same sort of
entourage effect of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a flower that's been growing for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it will.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they must think that it will.
[SPEAKER_04]: They must think like, well, we'll get
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's part of it is the
single active ingredient mantra of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry that every
medicine just has a single active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient, not multiple active
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cannabis plant teaches us
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches us that the biological action
on humans when we consume cannabis isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just we see alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all these other things that are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've talked about this
quite a bit on Hash Church about the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that modulate the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be really interesting to
take made cannabinoids, reformulate them
[SPEAKER_00]: with a natural terpene profile that you
find in flower and then compare the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you could actually recreate that
experience that you get from flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a, that's a, that would be
amazing to see that, that, that study
[SPEAKER_05]: done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think long term, that would be something
we should explore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, someone should explore that
because it's, it's important to know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's the one thing every time
I talk to these guys that are really into,
[SPEAKER_05]: into the natural diverged terpenes,
they always tell me, yeah, but you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know what's in your, in that extract
that's coming from the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just really confuses me because I,
I really look at the natural terpenes as a
[SPEAKER_05]: very narrow scope and the expression off
the plant, a very dynamic and
[SPEAKER_05]: three-dimensional scope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's confusing to me when I,
when I hear people that have extreme
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge and PhDs, you know, speak on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will just mention that I think Raka is
going to come in here in a, in a minute or
[SPEAKER_04]: two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can kind of maybe bring the
conversation back to music and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: welcome him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's trying to figure out how to get in
just with his audio.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I haven't heard from mugs yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just texted him, hadn't heard back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's early, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's early.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, you know what I know from
inviting a lot of people onto hash church
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years that there's always just
people who a either show up really late or
[SPEAKER_04]: B just can't make it, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fuck Sunday morning, Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come on dude, nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash church.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a, I got a seven hour ride in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pop off seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the heck are you heading driving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm in Vermont and driving back to
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you at a show the other day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Operation up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Vermont is legalized too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are putting in a processing center
in what's called the Northeast kingdom of
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont, which is sort of like the
Northeast area of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only like about 40 or 50 miles from
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that area really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in that area in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of folks up here who are
growing hemp and not a whole lot of places
[SPEAKER_00]: to process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, uh, Vermont's famous for
its maple syrup, you know, all the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: shacks in the woods and you just see a
bunch of trees and the sugar shack with
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke going up and you know that
they're making, they're making sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same with Quebec right over the
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we're going to see is
those operations start to be displaced by,
[SPEAKER_00]: by hemp extraction operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's still going to be
collecting syrup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be a different type.
Syrup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Syrup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a good safe travels,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 600 people watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought you might like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one question for you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think the price of CBD isolate
will end up falling to?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, um, uh, spot market
prices are somewhere between, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: 52 to 6,500 per kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's a six and a half,
uh, uh, about 10 grand Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I, if I, if I buy CBD isolate for
$6 a gram, $3 of that gram probably goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe another $2 goes to the processor and
then maybe $1 to the guy who's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: middle manning the operation to get the
isolate to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm not sure that it could,
I, I, I don't know, Sam, I really don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, I think I kind of like
what I was saying before about Oregon is
[SPEAKER_00]: that because CBD has a much larger
addressable market, there's more value to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought that would be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to gas stations in the middle
of the country that have no zero cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get pulled over and thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the gas station behind the
fricking counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this, there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gas stations, you know,
that's happening, that's happening all
[SPEAKER_10]: over Europe too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what, uh, that's what is really
interesting is all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the CBD is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of Switzerland is where it's
really popping off.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you can just go to the bodega in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's totally unregulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they sell most of it just in,
in, in the raw product of the herb and
[SPEAKER_10]: they use it just to put in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They mix with tobacco anyway, and they
don't like to get it stoned in Europe
[SPEAKER_10]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's becoming a really big phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_06]: The CBD history, the CBD, when I used to
buy it more than 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was several hundred dollars a gram,
maybe even 300 for one gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Mark's saying it's six dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somewhere between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really depends, uh,
Sam, it depends on two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I think that we have
to be concerned with is these large
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that basically are probably
doing manufacturing over in China could
[SPEAKER_00]: dump it here on the U S market and
basically put the, the, the U S hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers out of business because there's no
way that those people can compete with
[SPEAKER_00]: people like Jen Kana, who probably have
multi billion dollar billion ton contracts
[SPEAKER_00]: with labs over in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we talked about $3 going to the
farmer and $3, maybe $2 going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: processor, $1 going to the, to the,
to the supply chain guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, over in China, those numbers become
$1, $1, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way if, if China starts
dumping CBD on the open market here,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that these companies are going to be
able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there needs to be two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be sort of the way that we
have farm to table traceability and the
[SPEAKER_00]: value that's associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you sit down at a restaurant and
you eat that dinner and you know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: food and the produce is coming from local
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way the consumer is tied in to
that agricultural supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to do the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: In America, a small, small, small
percentage of the farm table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's becoming more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a collective consciousness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a collective consciousness now that
is happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants to know what's,
but they're being put in their body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's why I think a no till from,
from seed to sale, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: and even, you know, using cover crop and
re-injecting the soils with, with the
[SPEAKER_05]: right type of nutrients and not use,
you know, rotating fields and doing all of
[SPEAKER_05]: these same things that we use.
[SPEAKER_05]: In ag and we bring it to the general
public as our crop that is actually worth
[SPEAKER_05]: something now to a farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we teach them everything about,
you know, what it means to plant and what
[SPEAKER_05]: it means to, to, you know, look at certain
cultivars and why you need to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where I, you know, I think we're
at the Renaissance of, of looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: regional genetics where we're,
we're.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like the Dutch tulip bubble in the
1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a good thing we got bubble man
on our side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where do you think it goes from here,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the CBD, all the small producers
and the people who can't do it efficiently
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to go belly up, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look what's happening in Oregon
already with the price of both
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational and medical, but the prices
have fallen through the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to welcome Raka into the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that you just made it in dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super low tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to, I had to go give myself a crash
course in this before I could get on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, I guess we connected the dots.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been just sort of shooting the shit,
telling some stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morgan Mojo Morgan was in earlier talking
a little bit about his latest album and,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, just talking, talking about music,
talking about cannabis, got a little into
[SPEAKER_04]: some deep questions there, Colin,
for a little bit about breeding and genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We geeked out hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just chilling out, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you been?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing okay, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah, staying busy, working,
always writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been off the road for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Evidence has been doing a solo tour for
the past solo campaign for the past year
[SPEAKER_03]: or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just gearing up, just gearing up and
charging up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I linked up with Ev in Vancouver when he
was here recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some, I guess on the tour before
actually with atmosphere shirt from those
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I saw you guys, I didn't actually
bump into say hi, but I saw you guys in
[SPEAKER_04]: Toronto at the Chong, Chong brand park.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Chum Chum Chum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, Chum like Chum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Chum Gang like Barack Obama's
old crew back in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was the Chum Gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was probably on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, Evidence has been just
working on his solo campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was something that's been planned
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew it was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the same time, my DJ Babu,
he opened a school with his crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: the B Junkie Institute of Sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like a full DJ curriculum
for a lot of youth stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they're sending champions out of
that school, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a real serious DJ school.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is that school, Raka?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in, I believe, technically it's in
Glendale, California, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that technically it's in Glendale,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seen some video footage from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set up a lot of turntables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's what's also really cool,
I mean, I mean, it's L.A., so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's easy to find money for
people that want to just throw throw money
[SPEAKER_03]: at something to become a DJ, but to
actually take the time to teach really
[SPEAKER_03]: strong fundamentals to the kids and not
just be a push button, but to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: understand and appreciate the music that
you're spinning and to listen to the music
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than just trying to match beats to
keep the party live.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really strong way that they're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a couple of schools like that in
New York City for a while, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DJ Emerge is a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ran one for a little while out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's that's how you do it,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Inspire the young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, otherwise, you really don't have a
if you have an opportunity to inspire the
[SPEAKER_03]: youth who are going to be the future and
you don't, then you really don't have much
[SPEAKER_03]: of a much place to really complain about
what happens in the future when you've had
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had an opportunity to to to to help
shape that and help, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are the when you get when you get
with them, you like how young are they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they like little little youths or are
they like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some of them that are I
think that I believe if I'm not mistaken,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to be is it seven or eight?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cut off where they feel like if
they have like like open, open turntable
[SPEAKER_03]: days where, you know, if people come in
and bring their kids or little brothers
[SPEAKER_03]: and sisters, babies, these are even down
there and they'll let them play around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as because it's a classroom
setting, I believe it might be eight years
[SPEAKER_03]: old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll double check with Babu, but they
start really young.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like different levels of
classes, very young, all kids classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do like workshop camps all the way up
to full adult classes and even private one
[SPEAKER_03]: on one sessions with DJs that really want
to sharpen their turntable of skills or or
[SPEAKER_03]: people that don't really have the time or
the space or the equipment even or don't
[SPEAKER_03]: feel comfortable kind of working their way
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the actual clubs, they'll go there and
kind of get their skills to a level where
[SPEAKER_03]: they feel that they can debut them and
then and then jump in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they teach the full spectrum all the
way from very young.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say probably second grade or
something like third grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have some kids that are
really young all the way to professional
[SPEAKER_03]: adults.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good on you, DJ Babu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So did you get you guys came up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys from Bay Area or LA?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually from Los Angeles,
but our first records came out of ABB
[SPEAKER_03]: Records, which is from the Bay Area Hip
Hop Coalition, Oakland, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in our very in the beginning of our
career, almost everybody thought that we
[SPEAKER_03]: were from the Bay Area because we were
selling we were doing most of our early a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of our early shows there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our record label was in Oakland and
distribution was based out of that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was there that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was I was I was doing shows back then
and working a lot with hieroglyphics and
[SPEAKER_10]: some other crews.
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I did the I did the Pete
Rock sales smooth main ingredient tour at
[SPEAKER_10]: the Kennel Club in 94.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Benny B was the DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nickleberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Benny B?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you brought it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said the main ingredient tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, not Mac, not Mac in the soul,
brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have been the doper shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: The main ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was I'll make sure there wasn't back
in the soul, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, make sure there wasn't back in
the soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still Bay Area based?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm actually in Ashland, Oregon,
sleepy little hippie hippie town up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I work a lot in the Bay still.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I still work with Hiro and I do a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I produce the International Cannabis
Business Conference.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our fifth year is actually going to be in
San Francisco on February 7th and 8th.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we got DJ Muggs coming up from Cypress
Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Black Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my big brother right there,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know you guys were connected
with them like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might not have thought that,
but that's that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alchemist, Alchemist, who was from the
Hooligans, who was B-Rill's first group
[SPEAKER_03]: that he signed, that's evidence his best
friend, since they were in junior high
[SPEAKER_03]: school or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even before music, they were already
best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we were very well connected with
Soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were basically considered ourselves
like, if they're brothers, we're cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're Soul assassins.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's good pedigree.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I toured on the Soul Assassins
Tour as a hemp activist in 1994.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was working with Jack Harris.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I started this political action
committee called End the Hemp War 94.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw him on Saturday Night Live when mugs
got kicked off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had this epiphany.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were working with Normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I called Normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I called Eric Steenstra.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Eric Steenstra got me all this dap for
backstage and to be the cat that's handing
[SPEAKER_10]: out the little flyers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did like four or five tours.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did Irvine Meadows and then another
place in LA.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget, Santa Monica, maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then San Jose.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then one other place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was crazy because Al was,
the hooligans were, it went hooligans and
[SPEAKER_10]: then- Funk dubious.
[SPEAKER_10]: House of Pain, Cypress, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I went to the San Francisco show on
that tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I drove up just for that show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was the other show.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one in San Jose and then there
was one in- Oakland or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something up in that area, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I forget where it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, man, seeing Al was 16 and the
hooligans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember who the other guy from the
hooligans was?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Scott Conn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott Conn, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott Conn, he still has skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go listen to the Step Brothers
album, which is Alchemist and Evidence did
[SPEAKER_03]: a side project called the Step Brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe on that album, there's actually
a verse from Scott Conn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kicks a new rhyme after all these
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's still nicer than most people
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those kids were so, these two little white
boys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had so much energy on stage and
they were 16 years old touring with all
[SPEAKER_10]: these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they, remember how they would like,
I mean, it was, it's that kind of like
[SPEAKER_10]: classic hip hop performing thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have everybody crosses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Baggy clothes and just crushing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like crushing it and they would
get paid in cash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they would buy like, remember
peas were like 40, 200 or brody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I was like the head back beside
these big dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they were like, what do you
think about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, you guys are wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: You 16 year old kids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Al was always just so hella cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was down a long time, but yeah,
that's, that's, that's my family right
[SPEAKER_03]: there, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I met Evidence, he was
already hanging out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just like some, like a
knucklehead.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were younger than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were like a wild group of kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a TV show, like a reality show
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: These kids rent and, you know,
that's Scott Conn is James Conn son.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's like a, you know, uh, the son of
a, of a Hollywood icon, but at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time he's really in the streets,
getting into knucklehead stuff every
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm like, Scott, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go home, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm talking to these dudes,
like go home.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were wiling out and they were 16
years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: You couldn't even do that shit no more.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had like two 16 year old kids and
like they, no, uh, it wouldn't even go
[SPEAKER_10]: down like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody would let it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reliability issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some, I've never seen Sobs and
BMW sliding through the, there were
[SPEAKER_02]: shootouts between Sobs and BMWs in the
Beverly Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most creed ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time, you never know
when you were going to maybe get jumped
[SPEAKER_03]: or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to, um, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, um, I don't know what he, I still call
him a Seth, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shifty Shifty show shot from, um,
from, uh, from, uh, uh, uh, butterfly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know Shifty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember snow snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, just knucklehead kids,
but they were like very talented and very
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all like my little brothers,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was older than them and they,
I was, it was a big homie at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, I would come around and
they, you know, they were very respectful
[SPEAKER_03]: of me, but pretty much everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, no, you wanted them on.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanted them cats on your side,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a, that was like a rough crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a formative time for me,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I slay out at the end of each
show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how, how they would go in and
slam dance.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one day I, I was, I was, I brought
Jack, Jack head there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, and you know, there was slam
dance and I was backstage and I went,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I was like, Oh, I'm going to
go slam.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm going to go and snow I'm six
to 210 pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Snow is about five, eight, but he's a
knockout artist, 210 pounds and
[SPEAKER_03]: professional knockout artist though.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a, he called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a one puncher.
[SPEAKER_03]: They called him a one puncher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snow was like a knockout, a knockout
artist.
[SPEAKER_10]: No knock the hell out me, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He, he put a forearm up into my throat and
I felt for like months after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snow was around, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny that you, who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: The school boy was around while some,
so while some oil and cats were around,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was just like, gator, gator,
all those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now gator.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're bringing me back, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're bringing me sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we was ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like weed was more ubiquitous
then than it is now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, nobody, it was like hella cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could smoke everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody was nobody.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody was tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we were sponsored by graphics at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to graphics out still even
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of companies I've
had some nice pieces, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they are, there's always a
standard that you set for yourself and be,
[SPEAKER_03]: and be real gave me this one foot,
like straight tube glass graphics that
[SPEAKER_03]: still has the most perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm still, I've spent, I don't know
how much money around the world trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: find this, the perfect snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was still, but it was just that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was just sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a, it was, yeah, it was just,
it was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was anything you wanted to do was
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, you know, Vegas wasn't as
cool, but pretty much everything else was,
[SPEAKER_03]: was a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the glass was coming in like
Snoggrass, Jerome Baker, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerome Baker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: And be real was cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause they were like, they were like some
hood cats, but they was, they was on some
[SPEAKER_10]: like, like, like West coast conscious,
weed conscious tip and shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they were, they were educating
people about what, what really gone and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh, it was what there's, you know,
be Cypress Hill as a group or street cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and I know mugs coming from the
East coast, you know, that's, that's the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's, that's, that's big bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like the Abbott, like in Rizzo is
like the Abbott of Wu Tang, like mugs is
[SPEAKER_03]: the Abbott of, of, of, of soul assassins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, um, so that's, that's
everybody's big bro in the crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, man, I mean, it was just,
you know, be real though, beyond being a
[SPEAKER_03]: street dude was actually at one point in
his life, like an active gang member.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was actually, um, not just like
from the neighbor, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't just live in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a park, an active participant in
some of the, um, some of the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the wilderness that was going on out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the wild stuff that was
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for him to make that turn and become,
uh, you know, uh, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: like an activist and, you know,
become someone that's really, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: built a lot of bridges rather than
destroying a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a very, that's something that
doesn't really get spoken on a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and right now him being out,
um, um, with, with, with, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: with his profits of rage right now,
like doing some very like socially charged
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff with Chuck D and the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a very, different be real than
you would have known as, as, as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as Mr. Freeze or Louie back in the days
with something pop out from under the seat
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a totally different,
totally different day, but he's still,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he's still a real one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He still has that if you want to bring it,
but he's just channeling that toward more,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, attacking the things that,
that he feels or, or defending against the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that he feels are appropriate
rather than just being a.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was, he was special that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: He just always had this like really cool
demeanor and was, was mad conscious about,
[SPEAKER_10]: about, about pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, he, he, he always brought it no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was always hella respectful to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was the guy, you know, mugs was the
mugs was the crazy one, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, you know, it was going to
happen, but be real was actually the
[SPEAKER_10]: chill, uh, the chill one, you know,
compared to mugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause mugs was psychotic still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to mugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was supposed to be, he was supposed to
be on, I'm texting him right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just said you were shouting them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, that's big bro right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember at that show, I remember,
I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I won't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would help.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no statute of limitations on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so we've been talking a lot
about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I remember being at that San
Francisco show on that tour that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about and everybody was outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like soundcheck time or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all the buses were lined up in the,
in the weight bench out there and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, all the security, all the
Samoans, all the security guards guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and mugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got bored or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what it was, but he decided,
and it was all of the yellow jacket
[SPEAKER_03]: security, like all the, the venue security
was like at the door and like kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: protecting the buses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just remember, I don't know mugs was
bored or something, but he just tucked his
[SPEAKER_03]: security pass in and just decided to just
bum rush the yellow jackets, just to see,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to see if I don't have to test them
or something to see what was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got surrounded and his security
came and split it all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just a big, it turned into
everyone was laughing at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was just that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's like, let me just take off my
security on my all access pass and just
[SPEAKER_03]: charge security to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like big shot, you know,
you used to have to actually really have
[SPEAKER_09]: to bum rush place back in the day,
but you know, like just bring some
[SPEAKER_09]: nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different time, man, different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see what he's doing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had the music series and he's really
like carved out a new lane that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the new Cypress album,
everything that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love, you know, I have so much
respect for mugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He did that house of pain remake that a
lot of people, the jump around remake with
[SPEAKER_10]: Everlast, Mayhem and Damian Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of that, man, shout out to
Everlast too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're listening,
man, but hopefully you are, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: strengthening and light to you,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had, with the fires and
everything he was, his family was dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with that real directly with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you know, everybody that was
dealing with the fires and stuff on that
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's Everlast lethal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known lethal DJ lethal since we were
in elementary school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of how we stayed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember like Everlast showing up at the
house with the hand, with the swap meet
[SPEAKER_03]: stitched or the, you know, the personally
stitched house hat that said house of pain
[SPEAKER_03]: and talking about this as a new group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start branding now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to, we're going to start this
group called house of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's me and this guy named Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember this whole thing
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was very, we were there for like,
it was like early nineties and so early,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, age myself too much,
but yeah, it's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also shut out to Aaron from DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually how I met you Raka and the
whole dilated people's crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also was deeply affected by those
fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, I think his house burned right down to
the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron, Aaron, I've known actually at the
same elementary school, I went to a DJ
[SPEAKER_03]: lethal, which was called Rosewood
elementary school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron AY, my man AY from DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Don to the whole DNA family.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, um, Aaron went to that same
elementary school.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all went to elementary school together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron was like two years younger than us,
but, um, he was at the same school as us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, that, you know,
I was actually, I met, I hadn't seen Aaron
[SPEAKER_03]: since we were kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to with my man, Charlie Tuna
from Jurassic five, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When the card started coming to LA,
he's like, I'm going to go get my card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'll go with you, man,
but I'm not going to put my information in
[SPEAKER_03]: a database and go get a card.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, you know, I'm not going to go do
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to the place and, and it was
seen so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just decided to do it since I was there
with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just get a call like, okay,
you know, they, they call you to the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, rock a Taylor,
come to the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked up to the front to get my
card.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raka Taylor is your brother, buddy Taylor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look around, he's like, it's Aaron
bro from Rosewood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ended up just, um, linking it that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right then he was like, yo,
I'm doing this thing called the hot box
[SPEAKER_03]: parties in Amsterdam to do a hot box
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dilated went out and we actually
performed at a hot box party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that hot box party, I actually
worked with DNA for about, I believe it
[SPEAKER_03]: was four years in a row, maybe five,
four or five years in a row after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was producing their hot box parties
in Amsterdam was at high times at milk
[SPEAKER_03]: wig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would do their, I would do the
Wednesday night parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would bring in the staff of people,
my man, Demi and a some other people out
[SPEAKER_03]: there in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an Amsterdam crew that I work with
and I worked with the milk big staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worked with high times directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked with the, with the DNA offices
out there off of st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicholson and, and, and, uh, and,
uh, I put the shows together in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: a flight every year, bring a group of
people out there, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and put on some Barrington Levy or,
uh, Charlie tuna dilated beach junkies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought out, I went to all those
parties, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, but that first one wasn't at the
milk bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the first one was not at the milk bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a smaller club.
[SPEAKER_03]: That show was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an amazing show, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you that was like,
and I've seen a ton of shows, but that
[SPEAKER_04]: show, I think part of it was that I was
sitting on the couch behind you in
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence while you were performing on
stage with Don and Aaron, just puffing,
[SPEAKER_04]: puffing bulls of full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Don's, Don's just leaning over.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, we're so fucking getting fine
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the audience just looked like it was
on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember they had a, um, a popcorn
machine there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his mom was like, they're popping like
popcorn with like Hannah butter,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that inside the venue while the whole
place is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're rolling up and passing on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, the couch is on the stage
and it was also like a different,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the clubs being in those really
big places, especially with everyone being
[SPEAKER_03]: so high and everything else, it's not as
easy to get that raw jump around energy
[SPEAKER_03]: that you get a lot of rap show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the one that was the energy
was bouncing off the walls there,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was kind of, you know, is not often
the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of these parties where
everyone's so high that you get the,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone watches and at the end you get
the applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we're used to like the more
of the, I guess, I guess you would say in
[SPEAKER_03]: our experiences more, I guess the drunk
crowds than the high crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's usually a lot more raw energy
people jumping around and flipping around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, that was one of the great
ones where it balanced out really well and
[SPEAKER_03]: we got some really good energy out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of, instead of in motion,
a lot of things for me to kind of actually
[SPEAKER_03]: work in a different side of the,
um, this business, you know, I was,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was booking a lot of shows, but I was
also booking a lot of it ended up opening
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of doors for me to do like a lot of,
uh, related.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up working with, um, weed maps
and, um, restock and Marley natural and a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people on the, on different
events, um, just doing a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was, you know, different
conventions, I was doing after parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Vegas every November for, um,
for weed maps or for DNA at the,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the, at the, um, at the, was it the
hard rock, um, the, the, when they were
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the, um, the hotel parties,
when they would take over the big,
[SPEAKER_03]: the big room with the private swimming
pool in the, in the hotel room thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the MTV road rules loft or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ended up doing a lot of events in the
space that helped me build a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: bridges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, I, I still do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing branding, marketing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a, you know, I'm kind of under some
paperwork right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was hoping that I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to get it clear to talk about
this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to come back to church,
I guess, pretty soon to talk about some
[SPEAKER_03]: things I have going on, but it kind of
made, you know, I didn't, I never wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to dial it has been offered many times the
opportunity to get on the, the brand
[SPEAKER_03]: partnership side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just put our name and logo on
something and take a slice that never
[SPEAKER_03]: really, it didn't really interest me
because of the circle of people that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was sitting, you know, some,
some solid people and I had a,
[SPEAKER_03]: a better grasp of the business than the
people that were simply just leaving their
[SPEAKER_03]: name and likeness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of artists that are trying to
like, like, like trying to just,
[SPEAKER_10]: just, just have someone just license
their, their, their name for their brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tell them that's never, that almost
never going to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you're maybe, unless you're like
Willie fucking Nelson or some shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, uh, you know, you ain't got no
brand, like whether you're a master P or
[SPEAKER_10]: whoever it is, it's no brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I tell these cats is, is,
is make something first.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, do your own thing first and,
and, and, and build your own business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you might be able to,
then you can, then you can leverage it
[SPEAKER_10]: into so much more rather than just saying,
Oh, we're just going to make a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every, every, every, every star is trying
to just like license that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, it's, and nobody's really,
no, unless you're just like, like I said,
[SPEAKER_10]: like Willie Nelson or Snoop Dogg,
then it's like, Hey, nobody really got a
[SPEAKER_10]: brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I tell folks build your cannabis cache
and, and do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and then launch that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say this Raka.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea that you were sort of
producing those hotbox parties,
[SPEAKER_04]: but those hotbox parties for DNA were,
were a huge component of their,
[SPEAKER_04]: their found of the foundation of their
brand taking off and blowing up because
[SPEAKER_04]: they were the new guys in town in 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think hotbox started in Oh five or Oh
six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think we did ours in Oh six or Oh,
I think, I think we did the second or
[SPEAKER_03]: third one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't know if they did a hotbox
party the first year, the year I met them
[SPEAKER_04]: was 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, they were brand new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we were at the milk bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: We both had boots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was selling the bubble bags and I looked
around the corner and here's these two
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking dudes with lab coats on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I'm like, what's up with
these guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I kind of walk over on the
friendly Canadian and I kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've been going to the cup for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, I was probably almost 10
years into cannabis cups in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess in a sense, I wasn't a veteran,
a veteran like skunk man, Sam,
[SPEAKER_04]: who's the grandfather of it or whatever,
but I was, I felt like a veteran sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was kind of going to welcome them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a bit of a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys were going to be here a little
bit more than just for one or two cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was sort of the passing of the
baton.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you remember this time
accurately, Sam, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: prior to DNA showing up, it really was
Doug and Adam from, from THC seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: from hemp works.
[SPEAKER_04]: That were sort of the, the go-to guys from
America that were kind of living in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam that were super fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's, I met Jerome Baker,
Chris Harris at, at hemp works back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was back then they had it as
the CIA cannabis in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it might've even already passed and
been the KGB, which was no good buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those guys, those guys were kind of
like the head of the scene and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: really like the go-to party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, that hotbox party that you guys
played, like the torch was passed,
[SPEAKER_04]: like DNA was just like, yeah, everyone's
going to be coming to our parties now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was quite something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Marcus, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Aaron's house in Malibu did burn down
in the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to, I actually talked to Aaron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he wasn't, when I spoke to him and
shout out to Aaron, that's, that's family
[SPEAKER_03]: right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I spoke to him last, he wasn't sure
he, his family was, he, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: his family was out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent his family out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to be heading up there when
he could, you go check and see.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he also just made a stock offering for
he, he, he sold some of DNA to raise
[SPEAKER_06]: capital and they raised in their first,
uh, offering $35 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And those, that those hotbox parties were
a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously selecting good genetics and
selling seeds all around the world and
[SPEAKER_04]: winning as many competitions as they did
was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, coming out, out of the
gate, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was, was, I think was really important for
DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the new guys on the block in
terms of genetics for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I remember when they, they started
coming out, I just was like, who are these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys and what's the backstory on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really earned their keep over the
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're decent guys,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just as people that they're
really, you know, they, they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just genuinely nice people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're family people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, uh, directly with their,
with their family units, but also with
[SPEAKER_03]: their, with their team of people,
they have a good team of people around
[SPEAKER_03]: them and they seem to care about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, I didn't, I didn't
come up with DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a part of them becoming a company or
anything else, but I do feel like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, throwing those parties and
helping to, you know, obviously I make
[SPEAKER_03]: music, but I also have a degree in
advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back to school instead of buying
some of the chains and the other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some of the cars and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went back to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just, I'm one of those kinds
of people and I ended up getting my degree
[SPEAKER_03]: in advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to go back and understand
marketing and branding and everything else
[SPEAKER_03]: and trying to apply those to the actual,
to the design and the branding aspect of
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA was doing, but also to the actual
experiential marketing and, and event
[SPEAKER_03]: production and, and out of, you know,
non-traditional advertising and looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: it that way, rather than just throwing a
party, I was looking at it like out of
[SPEAKER_03]: home or non-traditional advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really put that into what we were
doing with their brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we kept it strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never had any type of falling out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What ended up happening is they really
refocused on the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ended up moving because they're from
here, obviously from the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they ended up kind of refocusing on,
on, on, on building up what was going on
[SPEAKER_03]: in Colorado and California and all the
stuff that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that became their focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada obviously was a big focus of
theirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that became more of their focus in
doing these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But earlier this year I spoke to Don and
Aaron and they were talking about trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to do some other, some, you know,
trying to bring some hot box stuff back or
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some other kinds of events and
other, a lot of other people, I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: even realize that we're watching those
events online or that we're taking the
[SPEAKER_03]: trip out, trips out there or just hearing
from other people have started to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out and ask, you know, what's going
on next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I doing in April?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I help them to do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they have an event, they need an after
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's, it's an easy thing to
do to just hire somebody that knows people
[SPEAKER_03]: to get artists to come down, especially
when there's so much disposable income
[SPEAKER_03]: floating around or, or pay for income,
a lot of different types of ways to get
[SPEAKER_03]: happy, but to actually bring in the right
people that understand what it is and not
[SPEAKER_03]: just have the same people doing the same
thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and to understand how it connects
with the crowd today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's how to present that visually.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've taken the time to
really dig in with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually been my focus more so
than making music over the past couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have some projects coming out next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2020, there is going to be some
dilated stuff happening because that'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: the 20 year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an album called 2020 and that'll
be the 10 year anniversary of my solo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2020, there'll be some things
happening, but overall the past couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years, man, it's pretty much been
production events, branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say a good half of that has
been in, in this particular space,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like just working with a lot of
artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did artist events, art shows,
you know, specialty, like hooking up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, somebody, you know, we maps one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a particular artist to do a
particular project for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they needed something to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to come in and broker the deal and
work the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that kind of stuff,
which put me in a unique space to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry from a different perspective
than, you know, than someone that's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: lifelong person that's, you know,
a lifelong grower or cultivator,
[SPEAKER_03]: or someone that's, you know, just an
outside person that's trying to throw some
[SPEAKER_03]: money at it and try to jump into something
to try to make their money grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've, I've been able to work with
both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I prefer to work with the people that
have the soul and have the heart and have
[SPEAKER_03]: their roots in the actual plant,
actually in the process, actually in the
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also understand the perspective of
that the industry is changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulations are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to create opportunities and
that's going to create problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to be able to navigate that
imbalance, keep yourself balanced as
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be, you can't be triggered
by these other things in a way that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to shut you down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to, if you, if your goal is to
survive and to float and to build,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you have to be able to stay balanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to affect change and even
get certain things back or fix things or
[SPEAKER_03]: just things, then you have to have a
certain amount of power and resource and
[SPEAKER_03]: influence and understanding in order to
really affect change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, I've definitely felt that
you haven't been doing much music wise
[SPEAKER_04]: because man, I always like a good dilated
people's concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was walking in Toronto,
like I can't even remember when it was now
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to so many different events.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm walking in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had just seen evidence and atmosphere in
Vancouver and I'm in Toronto, maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: month or two later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see on a, on a poll, dilated
people's and I'm like, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I text evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, are you in Toronto?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was to that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the day that I was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, are you in Toronto?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, yeah, dude, we got called in
for the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, holy shit, dude,
put me on the fucking list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a, maybe I don't know if we
had like a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two weeks at the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a promoted anything that we
promoted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't anything we knew about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got a last minute call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you guys fly out to Toronto?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the business was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hadn't done anything together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hadn't, you know, just to do a random
show doesn't excite us right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if it's not a campaign surrounding it
or a special event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was a special event.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was going to be, it was going
to be, I believe free for, for the people
[SPEAKER_03]: at the, you know, uh, for the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, we were like, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we love Toronto anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a, one of our favorite cities,
you know, I mean, you know, we grew up
[SPEAKER_03]: performing at the opera house and around
the corner from the real jerk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would go do the show and go to the
real jerk twice a day and eat,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was just, we love Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to go out there and,
and be able to rock a show like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it'd have it be one of the rare
dilated group performances that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing and, and have the business be right
and have it just be a, it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was just a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you got a chance to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually my friend who was working
with that brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Kip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red haired cat that, uh, that was a big
part of like, you know, get, getting you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we had a great time calling back
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a huge hip hop fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he has been since I've known him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I texted Aaron.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Rack is shouting you out on
Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man, we, we, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good deal right there,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: His whole family, I mean, like Don Don and
the family, we, we did a lot of crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of, a lot of late nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we had a lot of fun too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are those, there's those hash,
you know, legends of hash dinners and all
[SPEAKER_03]: those things that I, I'm not a legend of
hash by any stretch of the imagination,
[SPEAKER_03]: but some kind of way they always had a
seat for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The group was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, like it was, it was just,
it's just a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the community, I think it's,
it's, it's, you know, some part of me is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a little bit sad because there are a
lot of people that are really good hearted
[SPEAKER_03]: people, really people with a lot of strong
integrity and that put a lot of their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their blood, sweat and tears into this
and, and, and are necessarily they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily, either they weren't able to,
or they didn't make certain adjustments to
[SPEAKER_03]: allow them to really thrive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you know,
there's, you know, there's still a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: me that's really excited about the
majority.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, I'm really excited
about the, you know, the opportunities in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future, the potential for the future
and, and what this community can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the community is,
is, is entrenched in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: places that are able to come to light now
because attitudes are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The laws are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there are always the
frontliners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to see the frontliners not get
their respect as the people that laid it
[SPEAKER_03]: on the line for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever we could do to support the
frontliners while at the same time pushing
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for, you know, for continued growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that, that balance is always the
100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking that earlier when,
when Mojo was talking about his product,
[SPEAKER_04]: the CBD product, and then Sam was
mentioning, like, I don't care if every
[SPEAKER_04]: judge and policeman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I see both sides, but I really love the
idea of some of these reggae art artists
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been singing about this for like
40, 50 years, getting their heads cracked
[SPEAKER_04]: open with batons tossed in jail,
you know, treated like the lowest dregs of
[SPEAKER_04]: society, singing about the medicinal
aspects of cannabis for like decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, they should probably just
be like, oh, they should all have
[SPEAKER_04]: companies and products.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think it's, and those,
that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, but the other side, the other
group of people are the people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: non artists, because the reggae artists,
at least they usually have like a fan
base.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like moral support.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have people in the streets that are
keeping their name out there and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and buying their records and free
so-and-so and wearing the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on top of those people, to me,
it's the people that were just doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that legitimately cared about
people's health that are in jail,
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe they're not even in jail right
now, but they had to spend their entire
[SPEAKER_03]: life savings or lose everything to fight,
to stay out of jail or they, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: are they going to get there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there, you know, some kind of way
they're going to get the benefit or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is there a fund set up for these
people that we can measure that say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, would you lost it all you,
some of the stuff that we're pointing to
[SPEAKER_03]: as things that we're able to get this
business moving to this level or because
[SPEAKER_03]: you sacrificed, you know, 10 years ago,
20 years ago, five years ago, because you
[SPEAKER_03]: went to jail or because, you know,
you had your head beat in or because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you had your whole bank account
depleted by the government, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: taken from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't give anything back,
you know, and, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what can we do for these people
too?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to see these reggae artists get out
and go platinum, but I'd love to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that go diamond and, and get
everything they deserve for, for giving us
[SPEAKER_03]: theme songs and giving us the
inspirational music to push on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would really love to see these
frontliners, man, these soldiers that put
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves on the front line that grew
when they said it was illegal before the
[SPEAKER_03]: county, before the state, when the whole
world was, was, was treating them as
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculously as the feds treat everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see them get some kind of,
you know, benefit from this directly as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them may even be excluded from
being involved in this business because of
[SPEAKER_03]: what they did in the past, you know,
and it's really an unfair situation for
[SPEAKER_03]: certain people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I'm looking at, I turn on
the TV and I see, you know, Marlboro just
[SPEAKER_03]: invested a billion dollars into this
while, meanwhile, this person who fought
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and lost everything while,
you know, and, and these other people who
[SPEAKER_03]: would have, would have, would have gladly
supported whatever side was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they have a billion dollar
investments, you know, like some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: money needs to go, I don't know,
kind of get earmarked or taken care of
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these things that they,
some of these problems they created.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, they did it in,
they did it in Jamaica in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like as regulations were coming
into place for Jamaica, as they were going
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow business and government and they,
the whole, the whole of Jamaica was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, the blood clots going to,
it's going to be so corrupt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be such a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one thing I thought they really
did right was they just were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were like, okay, the Rastas,
you guys can just have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have, you know, you can sell it
amongst yourselves, trade it amongst
[SPEAKER_04]: yourselves, grow it, have it, you know,
set up booths to sell it at concert events
[SPEAKER_04]: and Rastafarian events.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was pretty cool in a
sense that they were just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, listen, we got a grandfather,
these motherfuckers in, they are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: start singing songs on the radio about us
if we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I think there's, I think that's
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's great to hear that they
are, you know, decriminalizing or allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: them to, to do, you know, what they need
to do and what they'd like to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, especially because, especially
when you're dealing with Rastas,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's much more than just getting high.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sake of getting high, it's a much
deeper situation than that, a much deeper
[SPEAKER_03]: situation than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but also there are a lot of Rastas
that are dead right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are a lot of Rastas in
that same community that are in prison
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are they vacating sentences?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they, are they returning property?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they supporting the community that
maybe has been taken down by some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: policies that are now beneficial to the
government because they're being taxed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's the kind of stuff that I'd
like to see get, you know, you can't go
[SPEAKER_03]: back and completely, you can't go back and
undo anything that's been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can definitely do things to
balance it or to, to address it and to try
[SPEAKER_03]: to make it a situation, to try to even out
the effect, I guess, on some level.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the norm in every other business.
[SPEAKER_06]: The visionaries seldom end up with much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's usually the bankers and the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's reality.
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and, but it doesn't make it fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it absolutely reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it absolutely how things go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't know reality had to be fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd concur on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely doesn't have to be fair,
but I'd like it to be fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to, I'd like, I'd like it to be
fair when the opportunity and the
[SPEAKER_03]: resources are there to address it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the opportunity resources aren't there
to address it, then that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're, if you're taxing people,
if the taxes are coming in at the level
[SPEAKER_03]: they're coming in and everything is coming
up the way that it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually people still in
prison from this, because here's the other
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that are in prison for this are
actually making the state or the feds
[SPEAKER_03]: money because you're, they're charging for
those bodies to still be in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have people in prison for
something that's legal now, and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: still making money off those people being
in prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, and the wages as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the real money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's where it, where ICE-T
writes about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the money is ending up in the
hands of the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And strangely almost always does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think a part of the problem
too, is that with the way it's being
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized or however you want to call it,
there's no sort of admitting like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, listen, we lied.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were, we were not telling the truth and
we lied about all this and THC is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: harmless and you don't need to protect the
children, but they didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came out still kind of not admitting
they lied, still saying you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: protect the children, still sort of like
kind of creating this sort of narrow
[SPEAKER_04]: version of what they want it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: California and other states have made
small steps in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_06]: where they're eliminating any criminal
records for non-violent candidates.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a small step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, and that's what I,
that's the kind of stuff I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: as, as that happens more, then it'll,
this feels a little bit better to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the overall, like, and it doesn't
have to feel any particular way to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's business, it's, it's commerce
at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's regulated, taxed, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if we're talking,
if we, if the conversation ever drifts
[SPEAKER_03]: over to hearts and minds, it seems like
the, the right thing to do to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to make, to, is to go back and say,
look, if we've decided that this is no
[SPEAKER_03]: longer illegal and the reason we've
decided that it's no longer illegal is
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've done our research and what
we said, the, the problems were with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've decided are no longer the problems
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the people in general that are
dealing with this should have the ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that situation corrected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it is happening slowly
in certain, certain parts of California
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully across California,
and it will continue to happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that, that becomes the norm
wherever it's legalized, like anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: that's dealing with it, that had to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hopefully, I mean, it doesn't,
hopefully the feds just get out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: get their head out their ass and just,
just, you know, let it be what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that, a lot of money will get
lost that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read the news today that the United
Nations, who was thinking about
[SPEAKER_06]: rescheduling cannabis, they put off the
decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were singing a Beatles song
there, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the news today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: About a lucky man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about South Korea.
[SPEAKER_07]: For medical, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: For medical, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people don't know this also about
me is that my mom is actually I'm part
[SPEAKER_03]: Korean.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom is from Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when I go, I have friends out
there, a lot of the musician, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger, bigger artists out there are
friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they're, they had like the
draconian laws out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had laws out there like, Hey,
that guy smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could tell that you could tell
the police that somebody down the street
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could, the police will then go test
their hair, go do whatever they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could say, yeah, I smoked,
but it was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't even in the They're like,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still a citizen of here,
of this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a result, you might go to jail
for four years for smoking a joint in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Singapore is the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Singapore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the Asian countries are based on
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they didn't have the death sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, I think it was Singapore
wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw, but it's like, they have the
punishable by death, like in full view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Singapore for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bali as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty harsh.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're saying is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medical is now becoming legalized,
but in North Korea, marijuana is not
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been legal the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some of the biggest news that's
come out recently in terms of like global
[SPEAKER_10]: change is actually Luxembourg,
which is a small relatively small country.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a huge deal when it comes to
the UN treaty.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to that, they claim they're
going to tax and regulate and sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has not been done by a Western
federal.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so huge for Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Canada, but nowhere in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so big because Luxembourg,
though they're small, they're basically a
[SPEAKER_10]: de facto government for the EU.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're directly connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the middle of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to cross this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the European government is held and
it's in Brussels, it's in Luxembourg and
[SPEAKER_10]: it's in Strasbourg.
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the three points where the
Europeans go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also where a hell of a lot of people
have their money stashed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also one little caveat is they've
been... Parked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not stashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parked.
[SPEAKER_10]: One interesting caveat to the Luxembourg
thing is that they've been, when it comes
[SPEAKER_10]: to public corporations in Germany,
they're not being allowed to go on the
[SPEAKER_10]: DAX, the stock market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all controlled out of
Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when Luxembourg legalizes,
there's all these, though it's just a
[SPEAKER_10]: small country, there's all these major
ramifications throughout Europe that it'll
[SPEAKER_10]: have, as well as the world because they're
so connected into the EU.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that gives hegemony for the UN.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of hegemony for the UN to
then kind of have a pass to act.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you go to Europe and you talk
about, like when Canada legalized,
[SPEAKER_10]: Canada is putting all his weed into
Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when Canada legalized, now it was not
under medical auspices anymore,
[SPEAKER_10]: it was recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was this big thing in Germany
where they're going to be able to still
[SPEAKER_10]: import herb because of the UN treaty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you never hear Yankees talk about the
UN treaties because we run that shit
[SPEAKER_10]: anyway and it doesn't matter, we do
whatever we fucking want.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Europe, they actually like that
shit matters, like the Geneva Convention
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking matters, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's in their discourse,
in their political discourse, how they
[SPEAKER_10]: determine how things are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational cannot be done in any sort of
compliance with the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and so what's happening is there's
examples that are not in compliance.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's chiseling away, it's breaking
at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, my personal opinion is that
if Luxembourg legalizes, then I really
[SPEAKER_10]: think that that is the beginning of the
end.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're going to see Switzerland
legalized very soon thereafter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when Switzerland, I was there
when they were doing their marches in
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland, decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember there was a big deal when they
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember also about Switzerland way
back in the days, the potpourri.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you couldn't buy potpourri.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically de facto legal in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could smoke on the trains.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was these double decker trains in
German speaking Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a particular one from Zurich to
Lucerne.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took about an hour to get to.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was double decker trains.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the top was where people's was the
smoking section, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was also this little couch and
little table shit, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was hella dope.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you would go up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is like 1998, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_10]: You go up there and cats were smoking all
over the train.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've literally been on the train,
had my beer, had me a little split and
[SPEAKER_10]: given my ticket to the conductor on
Switzerland and looking out at the Alps.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, man, this is some utopian
shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll never have this again.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the most amazing feel of freedom
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it regressed in Switzerland,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're going to then 20 years
later then it's going to all come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's happening under CBD auspices
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then the CBD shit smells and tastes
just like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the cops don't even know who's smoking
what.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's you know, seeing what's going on
over there is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also there when at the Cup in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I might have been the first Cup,
maybe the only Cup that's ever been rated
[SPEAKER_03]: like where they actually came in and like
remember that and they came in and they,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they they were resting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was a really ridiculous
situation like and I don't know what it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something where like there's
the community decides, hey, we're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some somebody else, you know,
the conservative voice comes in,
[SPEAKER_03]: decides to come in and regulate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there has to be the counter
regulations to try to figure out exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: what can be legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's a good example.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a good analogy or a good
example of what's happening in Switzerland
[SPEAKER_10]: over the last 20, what has happened last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was the Cup that you were talking
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pax Partyhouse got rated, remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2010 got rated too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I never I don't remember Pax getting
rated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember 2000.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, maybe they switched.
[SPEAKER_10]: They switched.
[SPEAKER_10]: They stopped doing it at the Pax and then
did it at some other place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the year I'm thinking was in
Eindhoven and it was like it was about it
[SPEAKER_04]: was right outside of the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it wasn't in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the mayor of Eindhoven.
[SPEAKER_06]: A different mayor, a different government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guess who?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who got searched first at that event?
[SPEAKER_04]: They came right to my fucking booth,
like right to my booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't even the closest one to the
door.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the furthest one from the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next year they rated it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sitting there with Doug from
Hempworks and I'm like, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do you think the chances are that
they're going to come and search us first?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I think it's pretty high,
but I feel OK about it because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm like picturing in my mind,
he's saying to me, I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I'm picturing in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of his friends from Colorado,
it's kind of long, scraggly haired guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He ate acid that day and he had like a he
had like a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those like jars that close and
you can't open them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a vacuum unless you push the
little button.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a huge five gallon one full of
herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw him like losing it on acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: His whole face was just contorting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched him take that thing and hide
it behind Doug's booth, literally an hour
[SPEAKER_04]: before we were getting searched.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, I think they're going to
come search us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that most people either hid it
in the trash or underneath the trash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were booths.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cops didn't find any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at booths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was different for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mila got arrested that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Doug was so I told Doug, I was like,
listen, I got some bad news for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, listen, you know, your buddy
there that was eating the acid was all
[SPEAKER_04]: tweaking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he he he stashed his weed behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your booth and Doug just like goes wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, he's sitting there like
he's like, dude, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be like a four year thing
like like a barrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even like a bag like a barrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a barrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best part was this was the best
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big Dutch cop fucking guys like six
foot four.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's standing in front of me and Doug
because we shared a booth every year at
[SPEAKER_04]: the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's he's fucking big, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's pulling the top of this thing almost
getting it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's going and closing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, he was doing it for about
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Doug looks at me and he's like,
I'm not fucking telling him how to open
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I laugh in my head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been such a wonderful time with all
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I also I only had booked till
about 1130, but it has been great talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to everyone.
