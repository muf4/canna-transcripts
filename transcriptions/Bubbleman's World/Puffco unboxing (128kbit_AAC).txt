[SPEAKER_02]: Hey what's going on everybody BC Bubbleman
here sitting out on my deck Got a plane
[SPEAKER_02]: flying overhead you might be able to hear
Just wanted to do a quick unboxing video
[SPEAKER_02]: about a little box from my good friends at
Huffco Got a shout out to Chelsea and
[SPEAKER_02]: Jolly Roger for this absolutely incredible
kickdown We're gonna be having Jolly Roger
[SPEAKER_02]: come on to Hash Church here in the very
near future And he's gonna be telling us a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about the new projects projects
that they're working on The new products
[SPEAKER_02]: that they've released recently And I want
to just open this box so we can see what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on with what Chelsea sent me Oh boy
Alright so this just showed up the other
[SPEAKER_02]: day at my door Looks like it's a good
amount of goodies here for sure So first
[SPEAKER_02]: and foremost We got the new Peak Pro Brand
new Looks like the blue version Might as
[SPEAKER_02]: well open her up and check it out Do a
true unboxing Been loving my electronic
[SPEAKER_02]: devices Been loving my Huffco I've got the
Huffco Peak Pro I've got the Huffco Peak
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the Proxy And a few other
products from Huffco Pipes and what not
[SPEAKER_02]: that they sort of fit into So yeah oh here
we go Couple of nice little stickers on
[SPEAKER_02]: the side they want you to cut Sort of
verification of like how you know your
[SPEAKER_02]: product is brand new these little There we
go Little stickers oh look at that just
[SPEAKER_02]: like just like the OG I've always kind of
thought this was a very unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: original case I've never seen any other
case anything like this Very easy for sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of throwing it into a backpack and it's
just durable and strong you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: worry about the pipe itself on the inside
having any problems Well that is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: slick I'm not gonna lie and it looks like
they put in that looks like a 3D XL bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: to me I could be wrong but it really looks
like it no I would say that is the 3D XL
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl it must just be the standard that
comes with the pipe now nice little
[SPEAKER_02]: handheld unit nice color I gotta give it
up to Puffco for normalizing hashish use
[SPEAKER_02]: and live hash rosin normalizing it for the
masses because let's be honest the
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of people don't have access to
dab rigs they don't have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: just like you know torch up a quartz
banger so they've been doing an incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: job with bringing access to sort of
regular people that want to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing or want to try it as an experience
so beautiful beautiful little piece right
[SPEAKER_02]: there nice little glass on the inside
there 3D XL bowl feels great in the hand
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super stoked about this I'm definitely
gonna have a mad Puffco session at one
[SPEAKER_02]: point in time that may be a part of this
video it may not be a part of this video I
[SPEAKER_02]: might just get the unboxing part one done
and then we'll do some other videos in
[SPEAKER_02]: regards to you know showing it being used
so comes with the charger cord right here
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they also give you a few little
q-tips little four four pack of q-tips and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just for those of you that have
never had a Puffco before they've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool little a cool little insert that fits
right into the bottom right here so this
[SPEAKER_02]: little piece pops open they used to have a
dabber in there as well oh there's one on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side and there's the dabber so
I've never seen that I've always only seen
[SPEAKER_02]: one of those little inserts get the most
out of your Peak Pro download Puffco
[SPEAKER_02]: connect and unlock deep customize like
vapor control precision temp settings mood
[SPEAKER_02]: lights etc so when we have the session we
will get into that we will download the
[SPEAKER_02]: app and make sure that we that we get into
showing that so there we go for that and
[SPEAKER_02]: put that right back in there actually that
went the wrong way it's very specific way
[SPEAKER_02]: it's much better like that and right over
there all right let's see what else we got
[SPEAKER_02]: here Puffco actually this is not oh I see
it's got to go in there exactly as well
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you if there's a wrong way to do
it I'll do it before I do the right way
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll almost always do the wrong way
comment if you're like me and you always
[SPEAKER_02]: do it the wrong way before you do it the
right way trying to get this moved over a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit so it's not blocking and then I'm
gonna pull some of the other things out
[SPEAKER_02]: here that were gifted so let's not delay
you get out what you put in so this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: new Puffco pivot and I'm not gonna lie
I've been very very very excited to try
[SPEAKER_02]: this one it looks like it really produces
some interesting vapor it's got a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice size atomizer on on the inside and
apparently it is small it is not a big
[SPEAKER_02]: unit at all so see if I can use my nails
to get into this little guy you think I
[SPEAKER_02]: would have well you think I would have
maybe brought some scissors or something
[SPEAKER_02]: but sticker comes off pretty easy so
there's that didn't rip the package I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know why but the OCD part of me is
always bothered when I take these little
[SPEAKER_02]: moon stickers off and they and they you
know take off the label or they take off
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the package so that is not the
case here except it did a little bit on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom there so this is the pivot
let's see what we got here oh there's
[SPEAKER_02]: another one on the top interesting all
right well we'll get that off as well a
[SPEAKER_02]: true unboxing video to show you exactly
what you're gonna be dealing with when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get yours I believe they sold my goodness
I believe they sold out in a big way when
[SPEAKER_02]: they released this product so I'm just
gonna kind of put it back together I
[SPEAKER_02]: opened it a little greasily so when you
open it up on the front you probably want
[SPEAKER_02]: to hold it like this so you can pull that
off the instructions are right on the top
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got their QR code as well so once
again enter here in about four different
[SPEAKER_02]: languages and then boom would you look at
that that is a nice little unit a little
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic on top that will pull off here
[SPEAKER_02]: well that is tight on there too very nice
feels amazing in the hand I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: lie it feels really amazing there's the
battery aspect to it it just connects
[SPEAKER_02]: really quick to the battery the battery is
ultra light it almost feels like nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it almost feels the same weight as
the atomizer so we got that and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: just pop that open it's a nice little
silicone piece that stops over the top and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see there's your big atomizer
right there not quite big enough to fit my
[SPEAKER_02]: pinky in but certainly a bigger atomizer
that I've ever seen on any you know type
[SPEAKER_02]: of handheld small device such as this so
that is incredible I guess inside the box
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got more q-tips and another USB C
for charging a little bit of desiccant
[SPEAKER_02]: there as well I'll get rid of so that's
nice just fits in the box right on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom that is really really nice looking
I can't wait to get these pivots going you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I was watching all of the the
advertisements that they had for it it was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of saying look we know you hard cores
are out there I mean they they puffco
[SPEAKER_02]: understands that their products aren't
gonna be an exact replication of a dab out
[SPEAKER_02]: of a quartz banger what they're trying to
do is that's the bar and they're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: up to that bar and I remember the first
puffco pen I tried it was a solid pen the
[SPEAKER_02]: battery lasted for damn near forever but
it certainly didn't deliver the hit that
[SPEAKER_02]: say the puffco delivered when that came
out you know a couple years later and then
[SPEAKER_02]: even more so when the puffco pro came out
the peak pro and then even more so when
[SPEAKER_02]: they released the 3d XL bowl I remember
the first time I hit the proxy I heard
[SPEAKER_02]: Roger say or it might even been Chelsea
say it's a it's a sipper not a ripper and
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of people using these tools
like they were that very thing I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: people loading up enormous dabs hitting it
you know leaning back so that the the
[SPEAKER_02]: atomizer wasn't straight anymore it was at
an angle so now you've got rosin that's
[SPEAKER_02]: being pulled in through this suction going
into the atomizer's holes at the top
[SPEAKER_02]: that's supposed to be for airflow and I
saw a lot of people ruin their units and
[SPEAKER_02]: then complain that they weren't working
and I've been guilty myself of ruining
[SPEAKER_02]: electronics and complaining that they
didn't work I've also become aware that
[SPEAKER_02]: that my using of the piece of electronics
incorrectly is what's responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking it more often than not my last
puffco with the p with the XL 3d XL bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: lasted for my god it must have been a year
and a half and I probably put a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: plus dabs through that thing I'd have to
go online and check exactly what the
[SPEAKER_02]: number was but I put a lot of rips through
that thing before I finally had problems
[SPEAKER_02]: with the atomizer now I'm cleaning the
atomizer right now I'm finally cleaning it
[SPEAKER_02]: the proper way not just cleaning the
outside I'm soaking it in alcohol I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna dry it properly and then I'm gonna
see you know what if I can get it back and
[SPEAKER_02]: working this one's really nice I believe
this one is slate so there's the color
[SPEAKER_02]: difference right there they did send me
two of these so I'll show you the other
[SPEAKER_02]: unit right next to it the black unit you
can see there's a very very substantial
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in those two units right there
so I can't tell you how excited I am to
[SPEAKER_02]: start hauling on these especially for
snowboard season I used to carry my puffco
[SPEAKER_02]: with me I've even carried the proxy with
me I've carried other units with me that
[SPEAKER_02]: have glass on them and one of the things
I'm looking most forward to this snowboard
[SPEAKER_02]: season in particular is to not have to
carry glass on the mountain but still be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get a rip as James from puffco
said the other day where I can get my head
[SPEAKER_02]: straight where I get my head the way I
want to get it so really excited about the
[SPEAKER_02]: two pivots obviously excited about the
puffco peak pro and then they also sent me
[SPEAKER_02]: this little guy little little dude the
glass adapter 3d chamber included so this
[SPEAKER_02]: is a little adapter that allows you to
hook up to one of the pivots through the
[SPEAKER_02]: top and put it into a pipe through a I
believe it's a glass grommet we'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: here in a second because obviously
everyone has different size glass grommets
[SPEAKER_02]: there's 18 8 there's 14 4 most of us
nowadays are using like 10s and 8s and
[SPEAKER_02]: even 5s I think I saw in best at ease pop
out a fiber the other day which was
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly small put those over there so
we can kind of get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: actually this one will go real nice there
these ones will go real nice there there
[SPEAKER_02]: we go so let's see what we've got here I
think it's just a yeah one of these kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of releases we'll just have to it's a very
nice tight fit it doesn't just fall out by
[SPEAKER_02]: any means you can see how tight that is
and once again on the top are your
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions as well as your QR code and
here we go this is nice so this is almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a composite it's got the battery
connector which is interesting I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to see how that's gonna work
and then it's got the 14 it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: that might even be a 10 and this might be
a 14 so I guess what you can do is you can
[SPEAKER_02]: pull these out right I'll show you that
real quick so you can pull the that right
[SPEAKER_02]: out it goes in very easily and it pulls
out very nicely it's like a silicone mold
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can put in your your 10 so
that's more than likely the one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna fit my pipe right there and then
let's just see what it looks like with one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these because I'm mildly confused I
guess okay so how do you do that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: go like that so now that's the battery
interesting just had to figure this out I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know why I can't figure it out it
can't be through just the battery because
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to be able to take a rip unless ah
mind blown so I'm sitting here going well
[SPEAKER_02]: okay like I get when you take this off you
have the battery but this this is the coil
[SPEAKER_02]: this is your atomizer this is this is
where you get your hit so I was super
[SPEAKER_02]: confused when I just saw that and I
thought okay so you add your battery to it
[SPEAKER_02]: what's that gonna do where's the actual
rip right there there's your actual
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary bowl inside the little L with
the glass piece so you just put your dab
[SPEAKER_02]: right in there you close it up you set it
all your settings are with one single
[SPEAKER_02]: button which is really nice because it's
got this bar of color that I saw on their
[SPEAKER_02]: ads that it looks just so slick I got to
give them a shout out for how slick of a
[SPEAKER_02]: product they have released here so love
the ability to interchange the different
[SPEAKER_02]: sizes of male pieces male glass pieces and
that's just so cool I can drop that right
[SPEAKER_02]: into my pipe and at the times where say my
D nail universal heaters not heating up or
[SPEAKER_02]: my I don't have it turned on and maybe I
have no gas in my torch I'm not I'm moving
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the torch and I think one of the
things that puffco has done incredibly is
[SPEAKER_02]: creating an atmosphere where one can can
dab live hash rosin or full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: without the use of a torch and you got to
admit for a lot of people that torch
[SPEAKER_02]: freaks people out so I am really really
loving this particular piece right here
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna take it all apart and put
it back together the way it was so it fits
[SPEAKER_02]: in the packaging nice and easily we'll put
this back to that they just fit together
[SPEAKER_02]: so nicely everything closes so nicely that
is extremely small I mean that is I can
[SPEAKER_02]: almost hide that in my hand completely if
I take the bowl off I can hide the battery
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much perfectly in my hand that's a
nice little ripper that beats any pen I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever felt in my hand right there so I'm
really looking forward to hitting some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that concentrated X full melt bubble out
of that I'll definitely be playing around
[SPEAKER_02]: with the puffco pivot glass adapter big
shout out to Chelsea for having all of
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff sent out to me you've always
been so kind and so generous and taking
[SPEAKER_02]: such great care of me so it's my honor to
use the products that you guys send me and
[SPEAKER_02]: turn people on to them my daughter works
at a dispensary just down the street in
[SPEAKER_02]: Horseshoe Bay at Happy Isle and they
actually sell the puffco product so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool let's open the final thing
which is the travel case I'll open the
[SPEAKER_02]: travel case we'll see what's going on here
that I have this one somewhat of it I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't call it a nail but I have a
little bit of a nail right on my middle
[SPEAKER_02]: finger and that's the one that's allowing
me to open all of this stuff make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all the plastics put away all
right we've got a nice little sleeve here
[SPEAKER_02]: that the case just slides out I love the
retro look of the case this reminds me of
[SPEAKER_02]: some old-school like pencil case that I
had in like 1979 pops open real nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: easy and as you can see just has a spot
I'm guessing for everything so I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna have to see I guess the main
part is for jars and then I guess right
[SPEAKER_02]: here yep that looks like that so you kind
of got your spot right across the top that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can put your your unit I'm guessing
that this might even fit it's hard to say
[SPEAKER_02]: if that fits that like that or no getting
to know all this stuff I guess it probably
[SPEAKER_02]: fits the adapter I could check be nice to
have the adapter in there as well not that
[SPEAKER_02]: I would need it but I mean honestly I can
tell for myself for the mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: especially I mean for you know for
cruising around on that's pretty cool that
[SPEAKER_02]: damn near fits so without the glass piece
it absolutely fits in here a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of sorta sorta I guess you've got
that little piece right there so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of go like that okay there's that
still more room very cool very cool little
[SPEAKER_02]: case fits probably like three or four jars
of your of your hash which is always
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient and I gotta say man good job
that you guys have done on this it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really really nice equipment I'm hoping on
getting a puff code code for you guys but
[SPEAKER_02]: in the future in the future where you can
get maybe a little tiny bit of a discount
[SPEAKER_02]: but in the meantime just go head on over
to puffco.com and you can get any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: products off of their website and I know
some people have been like oh I got a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: one a long time ago and I didn't listen
they're an exceptional team they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get back to you in regards to their
customer service if you have a unit that's
[SPEAKER_02]: not working or something went wrong with
it definitely do something about that get
[SPEAKER_02]: in touch with them make sure that you let
them know because a company can't fix what
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't let them know they need to they
need to be told they need to be you know
[SPEAKER_02]: let in on the fact that something's not
working I know selling bubble bags over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years we've had some warranty issues
and the people who need to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: warranty issues that reach out to us are
very happy the people who do not reach out
[SPEAKER_02]: to us end up being pretty pissed and
sometimes I'll see them like five or ten
[SPEAKER_02]: years down the road and they'll say yeah I
bought your bags and they one came ripped
[SPEAKER_02]: or something or something happened you
know really we haven't had many warranty
[SPEAKER_02]: issues since probably 15 years ago when
there was this rubber coating that the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer just started putting on to
the inside of the nylon without telling us
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually over time that nylon that
material would chip off and come out and
[SPEAKER_02]: so we warrantied all those bags over the
years so make sure if you do purchase a
[SPEAKER_02]: puffco product that you give their
customer service a chance if something
[SPEAKER_02]: goes wrong with it and if nothing goes
wrong with it well then just enjoy that
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of equipment as often as you can as
much as you can and in the meantime big
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you to Jolly Roger and the puffco
team thank you guys so much I am literally
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go in my house and start playing
around with this and tomorrow when the Sun
[SPEAKER_02]: rises again if we get another blue sky day
I will go out of my way to making my way
[SPEAKER_02]: back to you guys so that we can get get a
little puff puff going maybe even have
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B come down we'll do a little puff
Wednesday in the meantime the Sun is
[SPEAKER_02]: setting over the Pacific Ocean it's a
beautiful day here on the west coast of
[SPEAKER_02]: British Columbia and thank you for
watching and may the full melt bless your
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl sooner than later peace out everybody
