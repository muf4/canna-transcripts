[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here at the Heavenly Days Medicinal
Gardens in beautiful Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_01]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to walk into the garden
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just sort of standing out in the sort
of garden foyer where they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making sure I'm keeping the camera
nice and close so you're not catching a
[SPEAKER_01]: glimpse of anything that's on their
boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep people's privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guys at Heavenly Days were nice
enough to let me come in and do a little
[SPEAKER_01]: filming and a little macro photography
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I wanted to share with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we head in now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so this crop is at the end of its
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspired by Remo for certain with the nice
20 gallon brute pot right at the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got some other, I'm guessing
those are at least 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right at the door here we have a high
pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me make sure I get the lights proper
here for you so we don't have to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and do this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn green, that's the color we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Congolese right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Congolese is under a high pressure
sodium light bulb which has been turned
[SPEAKER_01]: off for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But an interesting fact is that he's got
this Congolese plugged in under the HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he's got another Congolese right
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's over a metal halide which
is literally burning right above us right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Producing a fine color light, at least for
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see this one is from the high
pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is from the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The metal halide buds, I'm not going to
lie, look a little thicker, look a little
[SPEAKER_01]: frostier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting how a plant can just decide,
you know, this particular one,
[SPEAKER_01]: Congolese in this particular environment,
for this particular situation preferred
[SPEAKER_01]: the metal halide light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I wouldn't go and say scientifically
that you've now established a scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened to work out that way in
this particular situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting things that we see in the
grow room, particularly with the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same strain, different lights,
a little bit of a different production
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we'll come back around this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll check out an East Coast Sour
Diesel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to go low, real low,
because I don't want to touch the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we got an East Coast Sour
Diesel right here, nice and chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that real sort of fuely taste in
Sour Diesel, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of that potent grab you by
the, by the, well I guess I'll say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab you by the nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular one, when vaped or turned
into hash, comes out a really beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dry sift is absolutely exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to second to none, when you really
get the dank full flavors of that
[SPEAKER_01]: unadulterated cannabinoid high coming
through with that Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast Sour Diesel terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, it's definitely very
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just touching the stalks,
making sure not to touch the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see me squeezing the buds in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really trying my best to not touch
the buds anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over on this side, let me get you under
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so over here we have a sweet
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an absolute beautiful plant,
killer resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, you don't really have to
convince me to love this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love everything about it, and it is a
monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even tell you where it begins and
where it ends, but every nug on it is just
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that sativa calyx sort of
stretching like a fox tail and stacking on
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the size of the nug against my
forearm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty big size nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say about the sweet skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my all time favorites,
a Breeder Steve's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cut's been floating around Vancouver
ever since Steve's really stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: producing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell is extremely lemony with a mix
of that exotic sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, not a spicy exotic sativa,
but this really sweet and perfumey exotic
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa mixed with the lemon scented,
you know, strong d-limonene and mercine
[SPEAKER_01]: and valencia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those orangey terpenes and citrusy
terpenes that mix together and produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: profile of the sweet skunk is really
something to be experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at that bud, how nice that looks
with the light shining through the back
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm shading myself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another Congolese here behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got, we've got this big
monster and this is the King.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the King, this little bud got bent,
but thank God it did because I found these
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful little pinkish hairs,
pistolet hairs that I photographed for you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll really be quite happy
with how those came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice resin production on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, it really just smells to
me like a God bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does smell like a God bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe even Jordan put this
together as a God bud cross and that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: there's seeds available on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice resin production, very photogenic,
not my favorite profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like that LA weed that everyone
wanted in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just a left, a leftover
remnant of that very time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much more impressed with these exotic
sativas, these Congolese's and sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: skunks and I'll take you guys a little
deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in here we have the Burmese,
two monster Burmese plants, one over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to keep the light on this side of
things so we can get that greenish light
[SPEAKER_01]: from the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant might not look that great
through the camera, but let me tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken some beautiful photos,
a much more thicker vegetative bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that sort of land race sort of
style of cannabis plant that I am a big
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the body good, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that that is a nice looking
lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's another king in the
background here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these three in the corner here,
the light is so terrible I won't really
[SPEAKER_01]: bother coming to my much in here,
are the train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a train wreck right there and
another train wreck right beside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could potentially use my flashlight to
kind of give you guys a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the cush-like structure of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different from these other sativas
that I've been showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell that it's quite a substantial
difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different from the sativa buds that
I've been showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just nice little crystal content
on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that was a nice little tour
of the Heavenly Days garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great job that these guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're producing really, really
beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are happy with their
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check them out,
this very product will be available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: MMAR and the MMPR patients that have
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Permission in Canada to purchase cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go check out Eden at any of their,
oh geez, they must be up to like four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five locations now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to put the link for at least one
of the locations in the comment section of
[SPEAKER_01]: this video so you guys can give them a
call and ask them when Heavenly Days is
[SPEAKER_01]: stocked and when you can go down there and
grab some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always enjoy your company here when I'm on
my little cannabis adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now going to go meet up with D420K and
check out High Integrity Glass Art and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to go and have some lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
