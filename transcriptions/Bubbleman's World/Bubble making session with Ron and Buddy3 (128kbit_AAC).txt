[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so We're making bubble today
here in the snowy winter wonderland of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to oh that smells really good
We're just gonna whip off a quick batch
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron setting everything up with the 20
gallon into the bucket to drain into the
[SPEAKER_01]: tub It should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running watermelons today,
so we're gonna go get some snow and We'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we got to get some snow a
Nice clean area snow is generally not the
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanest stuff even though it might come
across as maybe that it is it's not You
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to get the cleanest I'm just coming
and checking it out Here's Ron's
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that he built last year
beautiful You got some big plants going in
[SPEAKER_01]: there right right to the roof that's the
way to do it so Yeah, so where we thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah Head up into the back the back 40
into the snow we go Looks darn clean in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle You just take the top layer off
exactly This is Ron's private snow
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, I didn't know you had a pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put it up with the kids last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh good fun Oh, that's great snow So you
can't go wrong with that top layer
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddy what's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can barely see you in there Yes,
but we do want to make sure that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: clean so we don't want any dirt That's
okay pine needles aren't as big of a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem because we can separate them out,
but tiny little flecks of stone tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: little bits of dust and sand and stuff it
could potentially sink so All right So
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing right now is we're
collecting snow to chill our water It's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably unnecessary because it's so cold
out right now But it's a cool thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: show you guys that you can use snow to
chill Your water you can also actually
[SPEAKER_01]: make little tiny Snowballs and if you soak
these little guys in water for the short
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time they turn into ice balls So
you can get many many many of these little
[SPEAKER_01]: ice balls in and you can actually run a
batch Without ice cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do that today because
we have cubes, but it's something you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do So we're gonna take this snow back and
make some bubble Ron All right Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron what are all these here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's just the last crop he says hey,
that's great I Saw the dark rooms great
[SPEAKER_01]: great access that's kind of looks cool
with the snow all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pots grower supremus beautiful little zone
for making bubble today
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock and roll so I'm gonna come over here
Absolutely so for this the water we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of options what I would normally
do is Would put that snow into the water
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, and then I would filter that water
as we poured it in oh nice good idea Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you want to just put them here for a
second And this is store-bought ice I
[SPEAKER_01]: would not normally use this but because we
have so much snow and because the water is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be so cold And because it's what we
had access to we're gonna make it work
[SPEAKER_04]: today So we're gonna put snow into there
We've left the water outside for an hour
[SPEAKER_04]: just to get cold in the temperature Yeah,
so there's the water the snowball together
[SPEAKER_04]: nice because it's like you say mark the
cold of the water the better right exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love to get my hands dirty No,
no, I think that's good right now like
[SPEAKER_01]: look at so what snow what ice does you can
really see it bubbling see the bubbles
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out Yeah, what ice does in water is
it's a thermal reaction that it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: pulls?
[SPEAKER_01]: Warmth out of the water and that's how the
ice melts Ice doesn't add cold to the
[SPEAKER_01]: water it pulls warmth out of the water and
makes it cold It's trippy though,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we'll let this sit just for a few
We can see now that the snow is Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't it always time for a trippy stick?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always time for A little bit of these
you can see that snow was actually very
[SPEAKER_01]: very clean compared to most Yeah,
there's a little bit of pine needles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you said there would be yeah,
and because of that We're gonna filter
[SPEAKER_01]: this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably through a 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and let me tell you this is cold
Holy Jesus what God was nice just though.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave us a cold day, but not a
ridiculously cold day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy for frost everywhere It's
really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I think we're gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna need much more of that
Okay, what we are gonna do is we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: at all we're gonna use the five gallon
clean bucket Okay, then we're gonna filter
[SPEAKER_01]: right into the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna get the bags real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes I'm gonna warm my hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back in a second everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: It is always trippy time
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't find that my bag slide too
much when I put them all inside one
[SPEAKER_01]: another There's really nowhere for them to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, especially if you've done
this process of You know fitting them in
[SPEAKER_06]: nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you gonna scream first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gonna scream that water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right I want to we'll use the
45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be at least long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 25 will be maybe a little too slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going into the bucket that bucket is
not gonna help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna help us when we filter
everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah We are moving quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually Noticed when you poured it I
was like wow you poured that really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised it didn't pull the bag out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so Is all that going in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, we're just getting it
filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll probably be good for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just get this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically gonna be a ball of ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Now we pour water through that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make it a colder one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave the bag down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pour more through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is some cold chilled water Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put this back in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much negativity in this bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of pine needles, but they
came out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just add to the fruity taste of the
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that thing still going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so We didn't leave ourselves a ton of time
today, so we're gonna make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I gotta fly out so.
[SPEAKER_04]: A spot of tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I would have these all organized
and in when I'm filming, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nice to watch Watch them get placed
into the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all still inside out from the
last time I was here using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done our bags 25, 45, 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is the 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all color coordinated,
so if you don't like the numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can deal with just the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: 120, then we're gonna do 160 and 190.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the crazy thing, Mark,
I want to say is I've been an automaker
[SPEAKER_04]: for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a nice process.
[SPEAKER_04]: This process is just so much nicer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's you know, we're not knocking
squirrels out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to tell that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's telling the story of the
squirrels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used chlorophyll, chloroform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard to get, but I used it because I
wanted the very best solve it once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a real oil maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I made a stainless steel tub that
the chloroform out and products sat in
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it in the stainless steel tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a little heater, electric heater
underneath the tub on blocks, the
[SPEAKER_04]: stainless tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a two inch hose going in this end with
blowing air into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two inch going out this end to get the
chloroform gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of reclaiming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Evaporating it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it out in my back driveway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had the hose, the exhaust hose sticking
way out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we came a couple hours later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's this little squirrel,
little chipmunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was down and out and gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought we killed him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We felt terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: An awful thing for our process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went and got the old shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put him on the shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got him on the shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sat him beside us for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a hoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: He starts moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: He starts moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: He shakes his head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden he looks out and goes,
I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was freaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, where am I?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we chloroformed him,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to grab that bag of watermelon
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a Astro Boy Fino from the TGA
genetics crew, sub cool and gang,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders, say what you want about sub cool
and TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, they are full melt
genetics certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every strain I've ever run from them has
been full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You coming to see me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You coming to be on camera?
[SPEAKER_01]: You coming to make some bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my buddy Ron's dog, Buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have probably met him already.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a purebred bouvier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally cool dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we'll fill this up with ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw a little ice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to get the ice broken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to serve you well to have
the ice all, uh, you know, in one lump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, like I said, I'm not usually a fan of
using this, this ice, but I tell people,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, when you can get RO perfect right
ice, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can't, you know, deal with it,
deal with what you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't cry about, uh, that you don't
have the heady ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't make it, I'm not going to be
the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got three big bags of ice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get the herb in there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have everything set up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble now is going to do the mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to filter into the bags and all
Ron and I are really going to have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is pull the bags, scoop out the hash,
place it on the cardboard and clean the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bet you we get this done in about a
half an hour, which would be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want the one bag of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one I believe I saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got W inside that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, that's the, that's the
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on the spin pro and that's the
stuff that's off trim restraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a small enough amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can throw that in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, here actually throw this
nice and fresh and nice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell, I can't even describe to
you how good it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can't believe a bunch of
greenery could smell that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you put two bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put three bags of ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy in there now, another large
bag of the watermelon going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often I would do a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I put this in, I would, uh,
you know, put a little ice, put a little
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, put a little ice, put a little leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quick rushed batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm leaving for the airport in probably an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to show you what can be
done on the quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had too much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get time to do this around a
little bit and get that fresh frozen trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't suggest doing this with dry
material because, uh, well the crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: will just fall right off the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this big boy in here on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perfect amount of water we've got in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really just a matter of turning our
washing machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it about, oh, I don't know,
a couple of minutes on.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The water has already changed color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take long to get that color
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice soft mix on this batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only going to mix for about three
minutes and then we'll come back and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: filter it through the bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll make a little bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you say, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make some bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your tail wagging?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a happy dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a happy dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit snowy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice when you get a little,
a little snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day whipping up some bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water and ice doing all the work for us,
extracting the glandular trichome head off
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant body prison and isolating
them into seven different micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say bubble hash is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, uh, going to filter the bags
through the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a ton of time to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a real quick, simple move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click the button to drain and it drains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the color of the water is
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no, no, um, no doubts of the
quality that this is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm already seeing a pool of
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make sure we definitely,
you know, pull that bag up and really get
[SPEAKER_01]: that screen as flat as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That creates a lot more screen surface
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like to talk about is,
you know, a lot of guys want to know why
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't buy a five gallon set of bags
with a two 20, 20 gallon set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the bags were designed for a certain
amount of herb to release a certain amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of resin for the screen diameter for that
size of screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put too much resin or too much
herb in, uh, for such a small screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens is the one 60 bag starts
catching more than it would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so it creates a catch and the
90 and the 73 and some of those better
[SPEAKER_01]: grades, they get caught up in the higher
grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use the right size bag for the right
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think today we ran probably less than a
kilo really, maybe a kilo and a half wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 1500 grams wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about a 200 gram, 250 to 300
gram run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, whenever I'm in the
Kootenays making my bubble hash or dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift, buddy's right there next to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey bud, what's this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the bubble water?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a waggy tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, Oh, that bubble water is making
me itch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making me itchy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good amount of water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we could start filtering this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always a nice idea to put a tap in
on your bucket, especially for a 20 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this bucket is a little shrunk
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's a little smaller than your
average full size garbage can still got
[SPEAKER_01]: the same size of screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still use the proper amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice looking process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you on film and look nice,
the water falling down there and the water
[SPEAKER_04]: falling down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hose right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just give the old hose.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see a lot of resin on the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to pull the bag first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to shoot all that resin down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an average run for people right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be an average amount for people
to run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to show the folks at home what we're
dealing with up close here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've still got a very gold water.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the pump on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be a little clog.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a little kink in our host.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's draining nicely now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little shake around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just looking real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It went from yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a white.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked that shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's give it a little more hose water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean out that last little bit of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: More likely to clean it properly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're good there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can turn the drain off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little lift and get that last
little bit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and clear water too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that water to be coming out clear
towards the end once you've filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our tap is still running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got everything drained.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our water and our resin sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rid of at least a couple of
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easily like a five full gallons of water
in there, which means we only have about
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 plus left in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can start doing now is we can
start pulling these bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do, I want to show
people the process Ron.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to grab your spray,
bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move the camera off the
tripod while you do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a simple process that you can
do with a little spray bottle and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: clean the bag by literally going all
around the top edges, spraying everything
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the bucket that sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the whole hose to clean the
top of the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use a sprayer, but his
sprayer was just next to useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just use, all you need is a
little tiny bit of forced water and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do this real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the hose cleaning everything
into the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gives us a nice easy pile to clean
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pull that out with a spoon
Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a two 20 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really this is just pretty much mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw that on the old screen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right off the bat, I would,
here's a great thing to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Ron did here is what you don't ever
want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep your resin organized and
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when we come and grab the
next resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going to put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to throw it over here and
then one over here and one over here and
[SPEAKER_01]: one over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be no order and people
aren't going to know what they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I have always done is I've always
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it's a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cut right down the middle and it
folds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the half we're going to use and
we're going to start by putting our two 20
[SPEAKER_01]: right up at the top and we're going to put
our one 90 here and our one 60 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end we'll have a nice row of
our different hashes and we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: close the pressing screen over top of it
and remove some of that moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get on with that real.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ron's now going to rinse out the two 20
bag that we just cleaned because it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: two 20 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have to clean it a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a contaminant bag and we already use
the two 20 bag inside the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's okay to just flip it inside out as
Ron's doing here and rinse it off into a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket somewhere with a nice cold water
rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you clean the screen well with
cold water and then hang that screen or
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a nice line right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to hang the bags right
away because it's very important not to
[SPEAKER_01]: put your bags away wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never want to build up another little
tip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm pulling this one 60 bag out,
there was a lot of resin on the tops of
[SPEAKER_01]: the screens and I could have pulled the
bag out, but what I did was I dropped it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in and I'll let that resin pool
towards the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just give us less amount of time
that we have to work with the hose or the
[SPEAKER_01]: spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a very good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do want a spray bottle with a bit of
pressure, something that actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, will give you a good amount of
pressure so you can move the resin around
[SPEAKER_01]: and get it, get it where you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pooling the resin right into the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also sometimes if there's
contaminant in the resin, I don't see this
[SPEAKER_01]: as often, but I've heard a few different
people talk about it as a tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'll share it with you guys,
that you can use this to sort of wash the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin over the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't like to expose the
resin to more water than it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: because especially forced water will leach
out water-soluble terpenes, but definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a great idea just to pool the
resin into the middle of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how easy that made it for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right under that 220, as close as you can
get it without touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll pull the next bag for you,
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is the one 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is generally when you're using nice
material like a watermelon that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start seeing an actual smokable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say you're going to see that
with every strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the case, but you definitely
will see it with watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can also have this little bucket
here that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it on a stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could easily be upside down on a bucket
and be higher for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to do all this bending
down, but we're just setting this up
[SPEAKER_01]: makeshift today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super, super duper important to
get everything set up exactly perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's nice to know with bubble that
you can actually whip off a batch and
[SPEAKER_01]: still literally make an amazing quality
product with a little corner cut here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there like, Oh, we used Florida to dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't use the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bucket is actually full of snow right
now and it's kind of neat because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: making a really cold area for me to
collect the bubble out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of, a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready to clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put that in now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, you taught me a long time ago,
but now when I get to the better bags,
[SPEAKER_04]: rinsing those into the back, into the,
uh, through, through the, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't put this
personally into the 90, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely put it into the one 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, rinse it inside out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why, why throw it away,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the residence gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you rinse the bag with the cold
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll pull the one 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bag does not want to move.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we would have run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice release of the water in an instant by
just lifting the bag, allowing the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: to lift and allowing the water to rush
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a nice return on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this snow down a bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the snow in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making a nice cold atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, of course bubble loves the
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to have a warm,
warm environment because we're making
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that for a yield Ron?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've got a little problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got air in the bag because
it's so tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the air won't come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see how it won't let the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to lift it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's show them with the camera.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's a nice pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a nice pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to spray that up a bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great way to clean the bag efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let that settle the water a tiny
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you do that, you'll actually pull water
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pull the water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the little bit of green on the
edge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like a little bit of leftover
chlorophyll or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scoop it out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's like 10 grams
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't put much in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm full bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get bigger, bigger yields out of my 20
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I put like a kilo of dry and tiny
tinge of green, I know we'll see go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's going to be golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know the material too though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can flip that and put that last little
bit of resin exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your spoon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to leave that just to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rough hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little rinse like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick little rinse like that is
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a nice touch to tell people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some help lifting that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't need to hose it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're rinsing it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rinsing it exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get it inside out though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not right side out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually put my hand on the bottom and
just sort of close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I push it up, I'm not pushing the
resin onto the side walls of the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I grab it, I kind of close it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron is a great helper.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very eager to do things the way you
ask him to do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people have to learn the right way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll rinse that off and I'll get to
the next bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ron's cleaning the 120 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pull the 90 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be, Oh, this is going to
be a good bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got about two, two full gallons of
water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see how slow it's draining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch how fast I can make it drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that knock into glass through the
screens?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the glands aren't going to be pushed
through a screen that's too small for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even the pressure of lifting the
bag out of the water and that 20 gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: of water pushing through the bottom of the
screen has to be way more pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than these little shakes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is there's always great resin
on my 90U bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shake it, you won't break it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shake it, you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake it 90U.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love pulling the 90 when it looks
lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it pool right into the middle there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go a little slower for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just let it kind of drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to scoop it out with the spoon?
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's another six to eight grams
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait for the yellow bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the yellow bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but maybe a little less,
maybe four.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's thick, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is very thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice maneuver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're all filled up, we can use the
other pressing screen as a sandwich to put
[SPEAKER_01]: right over top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can rinse that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of 90 there, but it's just
going into the 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to pick that up though,
you can put it with the 90.
I just had a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good idea that I want to share with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we were to have a tiny little
compressor that sucks air in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: a special bucket designed to place the
bags into?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the bags in, you tighten the
screen, and then you turn the little air
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure on and it sucks water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks air out of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron, can you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we put the bucket down,
the bag over the bucket, how it creates
[SPEAKER_01]: these air pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you had a little hole in here with
an air pump, not pumping air, but sucking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a sealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to suck air, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to suck the air out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this might be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned for potential new bubble
invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see what I'm saying though?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when we put the bag over top of
the bucket and we push it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know how it sucks the air and the hash
gets like perfect for pulling off the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to create a little product
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not done till the bags are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make your bags last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it looks so good the way you've hung
the bags too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black one's going to go there and then
the 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you guys haven't noticed,
yet Ron is a quality guy and a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to be spending time with
him here and getting to play with his
[SPEAKER_01]: resin and getting to wash and dry sift the
buds and just hanging out with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: great people here in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, I can't wait to get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of a green tinge, but I know
it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two pieces here, especially are
going to be very golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you, wash fresh material,
you'll release a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say that it's water
soluble, but it does come out somehow into
[SPEAKER_01]: the water and it some, I've seen it in the
hash and then the hash dries and it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to disappear with the moisture that's in
the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the colors actually in the water,
not the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll show you that later with the
photographic evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pull that 73 you bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your bag, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why shouldn't you be the one to pull it?
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just go, yeah, nice thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gentler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take that over to the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd shave these handles off for future
reference for a bubble bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now imagine I had a little pump that
sucked air from the bottom of this bag and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just saw these bubbles disappear in an
instant.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows how good our hoodies are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our hoodlums are working for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: How warm we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually really warm right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good for me and the Kootenays all
winter long.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely below zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, this jacket is, I just love
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got my new one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to say, I am digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give that a scoop there on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scoopity doopities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fudgy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I've noticed about every
single of the last three bags?
[SPEAKER_03]: They are thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really what you want to see when
you make bubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, this isn't a
gigantic batch by anyone's means,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we put probably less than 1500 grams
of dry, of wet material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to think that that's about 300
grams of dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we should get a good,
you know, 20, 15 to 20 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as the guy that makes this
product, though, I don't usually look at
[SPEAKER_04]: the volume I get.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at, I like the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only interest I have as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're a good grower, you don't mind,
but the bags really show the quality of
[SPEAKER_04]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I did a terrible job of my own,
on my product, it comes out right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truest, truest thing you could
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I say it a lot, but because I'm
not a big grower, I don't think people
[SPEAKER_01]: hear it as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you just said it there,
that's a very accurate statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bags are the word of God when it comes
to the quality of your resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: How good a job you did and how good your
strain is.
[SPEAKER_04]: How good your choices on what you're
drawing.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, to rinse the spoon over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rinse it out in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing's going to dry up like that
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a non-rinsed spoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep your spoons rinsed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that 45 bag full.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the bags people tend to
have a bit of a hard time with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to hold a little bit more of the
water, but as you just saw me drain it in
[SPEAKER_01]: about five seconds, it can be done without
side walls of mesh and without,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, big loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people are draining their
bags with a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is just a couple of gallons
of water that you have to deal with,
[SPEAKER_01]: not 20 full gallons of water if you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've always found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Do
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to give a little spray on that
one or?
Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little snowflakes coming up in the sky
going in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our 45 micron bag, often a
decent yielder, always creamy resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: very oily, usually the first one to catch
flame when you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, for whatever reason,
it's never really a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a favorite, yet it is a
sellable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a product that you see at
dispensaries and such, but generally in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world of the headstache, the 45 is not
the one you'd pull out to brag to about
[SPEAKER_01]: your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a beautiful looking product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll take a few seconds for the water
to drain out just because it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: tighter bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of give it a little bit of a
shake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little shimmy, you know, just to move
that water to a new area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's making a dam where the hash
is so thick in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water can't get through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 25 and the 45 always do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to help the water move
around away from the down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to give that a shot,
do you want to pull that out with the
[SPEAKER_03]: spoon there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready to go there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
That's thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that looks very thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: All bubble-sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you mentioned the different screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I not heard you in the past say that
different types of pot give different
[SPEAKER_04]: yields and different screens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an extreme thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the majority of the part, if you're
growing indoor, you're going to see most
[SPEAKER_01]: things in between the 120 and the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed is tropical grown
outdoor sativas that are pure sativas,
[SPEAKER_01]: their heads are extremely small and you'll
usually get the nice ones and the most out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the 25 and the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a tropical grown like
Australian 20 week sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen that as much with
hybridized sativas that are grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, beautiful piles here that we've pulled
out for our little day of bubble making
[SPEAKER_01]: before I jump on a plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll just pull this one out and
rinse it in the 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spoon first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spoon and the bag can be done
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find when I'm doing the process,
it's just quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do my bag and my spoon literally
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can just pull this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very important process of saving
your resin glands and you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to hit the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would have done is I would have
squeezed the whole screen in my hand from
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom and when I lifted it up inside
out, the whole entire screen, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin would be crumpled in my hand and
then I would, you know, push it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: water that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way it just ensures that you're
not going to push those resin glands onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides of the bags and that you're
going to clean them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that is terpene rich water with 25
micron heads floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do still want to take it,
the bag and rinse it with your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your clean water out of the hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pretty blessed to be doing this
today in a really nice snowy environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually snowing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a beautiful snowflake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you want me to hang the yellow one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times in the summer time when I'm
doing this, these bags will all be on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when they're on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the planes come over, I think they
must see all these different colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got some kind of a better show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the 25 micron bag, the bag that
gives people the most problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bag that people say, I don't even use
that bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so difficult and hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bag can pay for all your bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a four bag kit, this bag can
pay for them and buy you four more bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a worthwhile bag to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're using it for medicals,
whatever the purpose is, it's always worth
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll show you, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show them the quick,
quick release.
[SPEAKER_06]: You made these bags good enough they won't
bust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this isn't like hundreds of pounds of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not Superman by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you're, if you're in a
situation where you can't lift this bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always suggest get someone to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth having.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a worthwhile bag having.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you see the water is released.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have built a little cage,
a small little cage around the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of this, and that would have kept
the bag from sealing around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it would have released more
water, but this is, this is makeshift and
[SPEAKER_01]: quick and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 micron is about the only bag I do that
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a little bit of a squeeze,
get some of that excess water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear a lot of funny things that people
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say online about damaging the glands and
this, that, the other, but let's not use
[SPEAKER_01]: the water right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use a spoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 25 micron is so slow to drain and it's
so easy to clean for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: these small heads, you see how they clean
off the bag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nicer than you see how clean that is
almost like the hose did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we put too much water into here,
what'll happen is it'll just never drain
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll need a pressing screen the size
of this bag to, um, to, to fit the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even right now it's bubbled up and I'd say
most of what is there right now is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, uh, bubbles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a pile of 25 micron and you can
see the bubbles popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, probably not even a bad idea to leave
this for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what we're going to do now is we're
going to take this, we'll place this over
[SPEAKER_01]: top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get some paper towel or a cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it under and on top of this and
we'll gently press some of the water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing a strainer process
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Ron's got the strainer, stainless
steel strainer, little guy, and I'll push
[SPEAKER_01]: this through and put it out on cardboard
as quick as and efficiently as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because we're doing that, we don't
want to leave this bubble to sit too long
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is kind of like being in the fridge
or whatever, but, um, at the same time you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to, you know, let it sit for
too long before you strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, it's, you can leave it sit
as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to microplane,
but straining is a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff will self press and you won't
be able to push it through a strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get to that next.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we've got our resin here,
our 25 micron still sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sitting out in the bag, which is
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out in the cold weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the towel underneath and we've
got the towel over top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our strainers, a little one and
a big one and a variety of spoons that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be able to use inside the strainer
to allow it to fall properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've also got, um, this is helpful
cardboard with all the numbers written on
[SPEAKER_01]: it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: 161, 20, 90, 73 and 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have, uh, some other cardboards here
as well with more numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty important, even though you
might think, you know, what's going on to
[SPEAKER_01]: mark down the resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying to Ron earlier,
when you put the 220 right in the middle,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have all of these, you know,
sure, an expert hash maker should pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much be able, I can tell you which one the
45 is the 73 and the 90 would be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to hone in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be impossible, but let's just
be organized and do this the proper way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do straining today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do microplaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microplaning is a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I freeze these after removing a lot
of the moisture, either letting it wick
[SPEAKER_01]: just like this, freeze them and then
microplane them over the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do stainless strainer
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to just clean this out a
tiny bit because it's still dirty from the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time I used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving it a little whack like that will
literally clean 95% of the resin out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like the strainers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is pretty high quality resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have to know with straining
how, what quality of the resin you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with an extremely high
quality resin and you press down really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard, it's bonded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to push it through a
strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well throw that stuff in the
freezer and microplane it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be pretty gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these patties here have now
dried out a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much for straining, I don't want
them to be much drier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the quality of this watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the quality of Subcool and his
strains, the TGA crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys produce full melt genetics
certified by me, the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our strains here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of lift it up a little bit for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: 220, 190, 160, 120, 90, 73, and 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take these for starters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the 220, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean literally I'll just put it up
here in the corner of the 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't push that through the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that on the strainer
contaminating my final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nor do I want the 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll both be cooked into metal bowls
most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those can just sit right there on top
of the screen or on top of the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first one I'll actually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suggest when you do this that you
use a separate strainer for your lower
[SPEAKER_01]: grades as opposed to your higher grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our 160 now,
place it in our stainless strainer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and literally just grind it through,
not grinding it harsh, but just nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it just falls as powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get Ron to do a few of these
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll actually film it closer so you
can see what I'm talking about of allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: it to spread thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you get to the end, when you
think that you just have all this hash
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck in your strainer, you just come over
to the other side and kind of give it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little shave and give it a little whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything comes off of your strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's our 160 done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our 220 and our 190 are sitting there
undone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take this strainer and this
spoon and put it over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has a lower quality resin and
because we want to be obsessive about
[SPEAKER_01]: this, let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew this cannabis for three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made variables of choosing phenotypes,
growing it under extreme conditions from
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling everything indoors to trying
to control bugs and powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in a greenhouse and you need
to add extra light because it's not sunny
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many variables that happen
along the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get to the point where you
trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a variable in how you maintain
the trim and what you do with the trim and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the trim and finally washing it,
not leaving it in the water too long,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all the steps properly, getting to
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, to me, in my opinion, is the only
thing that the water hash maker is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice mixing is popcorn and anyone can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's water and ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing the whole job for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower has grown great resin for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can take credit for is doing this
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this process properly is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be rewarded when you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this 120 that we have is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm going to put it on the 120
and the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very big piece of 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get that right into the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just put it all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little pile there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll want to move this out of
the way a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might even do 120, 45, and 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how it comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to spread thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to be getting all thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you need a lot of space for
the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do this wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clump it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hash needs surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it has the proper surface area,
the cardboard is going to do its job,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is to wick the moisture out of the
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why so many people that turned off
the water hash because, A, it was never
[SPEAKER_01]: dried properly, or B, it was made
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things, little variables,
like not leaving it in the water for an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the card filled up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where I got caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was tapping the 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've now moved into the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful, nice fatty little
patty of just absolute blonde goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get that out on the 90
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strainer just works so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say, I prefer this over the
microplaning every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've watched the videos of the
microplaning and the grinding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do it a ton, so I'm not pretending
to be the expert microplaner, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely, definitely prefer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just clean and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a drop of resin on my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all the resin off of the strainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you can see the, there is a
little bit of a buildup there from someone
[SPEAKER_01]: not cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it all off if you require it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so get over to this 70 micron here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 can go right into that same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we got for 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I managed to save some room on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be able to do our 45 and still
make room for it because I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys remember at the video there,
I actually put the 120 on the 45 and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's important that I mark that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are 120s now and as well that I
mark this down that, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a pen around, but I'll make sure
that I do that because I don't want my
[SPEAKER_01]: resins all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, 45, I can guarantee tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always tell when it's the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very particular taste almost
regardless of the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always very oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so there we have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it's really not as
difficult as some people might make it out
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your cardboard resin,
160, 120, 90, 73 and 45, all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, just wanted to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't forget about the 25 micron,
although we did put it at the 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the 25 micron out on the screen,
getting ready to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is easy to move in my opinion,
cardboard's light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go now and put it in the room where
it's going to be drying and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to stay away from dust, debris,
hair, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably take one of the 100 micron
screens, the four, the framed two by four
[SPEAKER_01]: foot frames I have and we'll flip it over
top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing can fall on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we have some of our dry
sift cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just shit that I cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now under here, we have our bubble just
sitting out on cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, sometimes I would have it
more enclosed in like, I like to put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza boxes and have them closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one comes in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably even seal this up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit more cover so the hash
isn't exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dry sift I don't care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's talcum powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stuff I've already cleaned out the
heads from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'd say we got a good 15 to 20
grams here and I'll be back to show you
[SPEAKER_01]: that when it dries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go get on a plane right now,
so hopefully Ron comes and sees me soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we'll have to photograph this
when I come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ciao for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll catch up with you guys later.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this is all dried, I'll end up
getting macro photographs of it and melt
[SPEAKER_01]: shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, I just want to give a huge
thanks to Ron for having us out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a picture just to say this,
you guys, if Marcus seemed at all fast at
[SPEAKER_04]: what he's doing, he's on a plane in the
next 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get him on icy roads and to the
airport and on a plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he did that rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you guys later on bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally minutes away from leaving to the
airport.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe you did a bubble run.
[SPEAKER_06]: We?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: You did almost everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, to let everybody know about what I
know, how long did it take you to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole run?
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had three days of partying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had drunk it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that full bell dry sip is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me hit you with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was a great visit, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great visit, Ron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really a great visit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, dude.
Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I love about great dry sip is
you can have the most valuable pure headed
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sitting in your hand and coughing
like a mofo and it's not going to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the dry sip, it's when it's pure
head, it's a clump, even in power form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to break it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a seat cause you're out of the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick your head right out of the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very nice hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing it closer to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, here we'll just put all that in there
and then get this in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one, the one that's trying to
cross my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, let's give you another special one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch how we can melt that up by just
putting the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at that.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't say enough about the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have to say that I think
glassblowers should probably start
[SPEAKER_01]: designing little things like this because
I know this is a canine tube and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a hundred plus dollars,
but I'll tell you, it makes them great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great carb cap really increases the hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It saves the day for the guy that hasn't
got a big lungs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slows everything right down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had such a great trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been great, Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once again, so good to see you
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, uh, you know, we've been dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been wet washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to hot springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen friends that I haven't seen in
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, got to make some bubble with snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to love the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have never been to the
Kootenays, I suggest making a trip out,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming and checking out Nelson,
all the surrounding areas like Windlaw and
[SPEAKER_01]: Caslow and Proctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all cool little places where you
can meet unreal people like Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching and stay tuned for
more adventures from Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where we're going to be next,
but it'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
