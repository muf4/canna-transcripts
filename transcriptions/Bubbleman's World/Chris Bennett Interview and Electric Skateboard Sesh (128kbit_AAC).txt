[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble Man's World currently over at Chris
Bennett's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me over, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our regular Hash Church panelists
who was lucky enough to, or we were lucky
[SPEAKER_06]: enough to, have you come back yesterday
and share a little bit of your historical
[SPEAKER_06]: information on cannabis and all things
cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, we're just kind of thinking we're
going to have a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation on the knowledge that Chris
knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought while we were doing it,
we would puff some bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I brought a little D420K Dry Sift and a
little West Coast Concentrate Bubble Hash
[SPEAKER_06]: and a little Heavenly Days Flower Rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a nice little... I feel
like these three guys right here are sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of doing it at the solventless quiver as
high a quality as it can be done right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you press this yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: They pressed it up for me and brought it
as pressed flower rosins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice rock star.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a cultivar that Remo is quite fond
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much would it take to get a press like
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a difficult sort of to
know, but I'd say anywhere between eight
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe 22%, eight being pretty low,
22 being pretty high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the internet, so there's always going
to be someone saying, well, I get 30%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, but there might be a moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's pretty simple to literally take a
hair straightener and squeeze a bud that's
[SPEAKER_06]: a gram that you weighed and then weigh the
two things and you'll get a real quick
[SPEAKER_06]: idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an amazing way for
dispensaries to test cannabis that comes
[SPEAKER_06]: through their doors to find out what kind
of cannabinoid and terpene profile they
[SPEAKER_06]: have on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily like a readout on a GLC or
an HPLC, but pretty obvious when you
[SPEAKER_06]: squeeze a bud and you get a big shot of
resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your cat's name again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I'm doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so awesome that Shankar went and
said hi to the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I remembered one of my full...
Boom, boom, ma, div.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry, Harry Ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry, Harry Ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that I learned years ago was like,
boom Shankar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ombaleneth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ombaleneth is definitely one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like one that the crazier... They
can get pretty loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about, of course,
babas in India lighting chillums and some
[SPEAKER_06]: of them are quite the character and you'll
see them really say out like a prayer or
[SPEAKER_06]: a...
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you call it?
[SPEAKER_06]: A pooja?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a little prayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a prayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a positive vibration put out to the
universe right before we light up the
[SPEAKER_06]: chillum.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you some antique chillums too
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I loved my trip to India.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely a never to be forgotten
experience but I think Nepal is soon to be
[SPEAKER_06]: on the... You should go to Nepal with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Mark Rose there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably getting ready to
re-legalize the whole hash thing there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet they're watching the West pretty
seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I started the hash bag company,
Bubble Bags, and Mark was manufacturing
[SPEAKER_06]: for me, you could go to Nepal during
Shivaratri and the king still released the
[SPEAKER_06]: ornament log that they came out of the
king's chambers and the ornament log was
[SPEAKER_06]: full of pooja and flowers and incense and
chars and it was free chars for the babas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far back does that one go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, the smoking though of it
and chillums and pipes, it's thought to
[SPEAKER_08]: have not come until after the discovery of
the New World and tobacco smoking and they
[SPEAKER_08]: would eat the hash, they'd burn it in
temples and they would drink bong or other
[SPEAKER_08]: delectables as well, other preparations of
food but the smoking and chillums and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that, there's a general view is
that that came with tobacco smoking and
[SPEAKER_06]: then it really took off with weed smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll tell you, I definitely didn't
meet too many babas in India that were
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking pure chillums.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all mixing with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately for me, not the kind of
tobacco that I would have preferred like
[SPEAKER_06]: the Jamaicans when they mix with tobacco,
it's very much Jamaican tobacco that they
[SPEAKER_06]: grow in the bush.
[SPEAKER_06]: In India for some reason, it's cigarettes
and so it's strange because you think
[SPEAKER_06]: cigarettes cost money, it's an added
amount and babas for the most part,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, at least the ones that I was
hanging out with weren't really what I
[SPEAKER_06]: would call like monetarily well-off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't own a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see babas with fancy watches and
cars in the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's India so they have every aspect of
availability that you could possibly
[SPEAKER_06]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the babas that I met were very
much, you know, humble like a holy man,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like a guy that's walking
everywhere he goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't often, the few babas that I
actually made friends with didn't go in
[SPEAKER_06]: vehicles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wouldn't go in electric vehicles and
planes or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were walking everywhere they went and
you talk to these guys and they're telling
[SPEAKER_06]: you about their trips to Nepal and they're
talking about Tibet and they're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about the south of India.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a phenomenal amount of traveling on
your feet to really wrap your mind around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course the thing that blew me away,
it's not like they're taking roads and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff they're like these babas from Nepal
come down for like one of these events,
[SPEAKER_06]: a big holy event like a Kumbh Mela and you
can see dudes literally with purple legs
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been coming out of the
mountains, walking in the snow for days,
[SPEAKER_06]: wearing just a loincloth and you're like,
okay, that seems like a medical emergency.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't become a medical emergency.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just go on with their day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six to eight months later their legs turn
back to the normal color and I was just
[SPEAKER_06]: like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, some of those trails are old,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: People would walk in that same trail for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you say old, you really need to
define that it is many thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their history goes back far and you feel
that vibe when you're in India sitting on
[SPEAKER_06]: the Ganges on the banks and you're hanging
out with these holy men and you're smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: chillums of charas that was grown in these
same mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, I don't personally follow any
of their religion or religious beliefs,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I was intrigued by them and honored to
learn about them by being immersed in
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people always ask me, oh,
are you a rasta?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't know what my religious
belief system is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly not an atheist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I believe in energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's usually what I say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Energy comes and goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've studied a lot about religion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like the whole Shiva thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much cool stuff about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the texts are really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you not say that some of,
maybe not a lot of, the Rastafarian belief
[SPEAKER_06]: system comes from that vein?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would seem from what we know that
Rastafarianism is like a symbiosis of
[SPEAKER_08]: Bible-fed Christian slaves coming into
contact with Indian migrant workers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thus, you have the chalice chillum and
caliweed and the dreadlocks like the
[SPEAKER_08]: sadhus wear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the flat Jamaican patty, I swear to
God, is a flattened samosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a samosa that they just
flattened out and made into patties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely feel that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dreads for sure, all of the dreads
that I met in Jamaica who always- Turns
[SPEAKER_06]: like ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely Indian term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: The longest dreadlocks that you will see
in Jamaica generally will be on a kuli,
[SPEAKER_06]: as they call them, but it's basically an
African Indian mix.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my buddy Indian, he is a kuli as
well, great guy, has dreads that are 14 or
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 feet long now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be hard on your neck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell ya, he's only got three or four
of them, but wow, it's amazing that hair
[SPEAKER_06]: could grow that long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a dab for you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just slide it into the, you want me
to actually do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, bubble it up, you're
bubbling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the torus is such a nice smooth
pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Been puffing bowls with this guy for at
least 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least 20 years, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit of flour loss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the intake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I always say two thumbs up for two tears
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can get a tear in each eye from
your rip, then you have done almost
[SPEAKER_06]: everything right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what say we show them some fun art
class?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, yesterday we were talking
about the Scythians.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Scythians basically did the burn it
in a bowl type of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they would have like braziers that
they would fill with hot rocks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ben has an incredible one at his
museum right at the front door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, just give me a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kinda fun to check out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris's place is well ripe with artifacts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is like a diorama of some
Scythians there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see the guy's got like the
horned cup in his hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is how they looked like.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had full body tattoos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting race.
[SPEAKER_08]: The men fought in battles alongside the
women.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the women fought alongside the
men.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a transvestite priesthood.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were a pretty interesting age and
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the timeline for the Scythians?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know, Scythians is a blanket term
for all these Indo-European tribes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of... This tribe.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this, you know, it's like 2,700 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2,500 years ago, Herodotus around 500 BC
wrote about the Scythian funerary ritual
[SPEAKER_08]: where they would take the heated rocks and
a brazier and put it in a tent and then
[SPEAKER_08]: throw cannabis and then howl with
pleasure, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that was later found to be
correct through archaeological finds by a
[SPEAKER_08]: Sergio Rubenco in Russia.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they found the braziers and the tents
that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then more recently, there was a find
of gold cups and bowls that were used for
[SPEAKER_08]: drinking cannabis because they were also
drinkers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was mistakenly reported as bongs
in the mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_08]: One paper got it wrong, one big paper,
and then everybody else got the same
[SPEAKER_08]: mistake wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the archaeologists involved say that
that was actually used for drinking haoma,
[SPEAKER_08]: which follows in line with my last book,
Cannabis and Soma Solution, where I was
[SPEAKER_08]: showing these Indo-European tribes were
drinking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soma preparation, not the amniated
muscaria has been widely suggested.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, cannabis and other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there have been other archaeological
finds like Victor Sarianati's find in the
[SPEAKER_08]: Bactria Margiana archaeological complex of
temple sites where they recovered residues
[SPEAKER_08]: of cannabis, poppy and ephedra,
and fossilized impressions of cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds at sites where they were making the
sacred beverage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this even fits in with that amazing
find in China of 2700 year old perfectly
[SPEAKER_08]: preserved cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is female cannabis that was grown
for its psychoactive properties,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is considered a spiritual thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was found with mummified remains of
a Caucasian man in China.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the Gushi culture that was
living in China from about 2000 BC to
[SPEAKER_08]: about 400 BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were known to be in trade with
this temple that I was talking about in
[SPEAKER_08]: Bactria Margiana because they found items
at both sites that came from either site.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as well, the Scythians that were found
with the gold cups and bowls with the same
[SPEAKER_08]: preparation, same ingredients that they
found in this Bactria Margiana complex,
[SPEAKER_08]: opium and cannabis mixed together,
were known as the Haoma Varna,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Haoma gatherers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they would transfer the weed growing
up in this region in China, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: back into the Bactria Margiana
archaeological complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine the level of knowledge
that the Vatican probably has about all of
[SPEAKER_06]: these sacraments?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was, of course, their mission
to replace all of those sacraments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at Dark Ages, you know, it's like,
you know, really that the whole period in
[SPEAKER_08]: the rise of Catholicism was basically
through the suppression of pagan and
[SPEAKER_08]: Gnostic cults that use cannabis and other
entheogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any plant based medicine they were
replacing with the blood of Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blood of Christ, yeah.
The wine.
[SPEAKER_08]: The wine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, you know, it's interesting,
like, there's this common belief that in
[SPEAKER_08]: 1484, one of the popes decreed cannabis a
devil's sacrament.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tom Hattes is a friend of mine who
speaks Latin and wrote a great book about
[SPEAKER_08]: witches' whiteness.
[SPEAKER_08]: He went back and looked at the Latin
documents.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes no reference to cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some other papal bowls where
they're, you know, against elixirs and
[SPEAKER_08]: potions associated with witchcraft.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis may have fallen into that
category.
[SPEAKER_08]: But cannabis isn't specifically mentioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's even a 12th century pope that
wrote about cannabis wine and prescribed
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis for a number of medical elements
in some treaties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although this pope was later accused of
witchcraft after he died, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an interesting relationship.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also this, like, I'm writing this
book right now about cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_08]: occult.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Cannabis Arcanum, Lieber 420.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the interesting things I found
out is there's this whole, in the 10th
[SPEAKER_08]: century, in England, there was this holy
oil that comes with all these prayers and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis was one of the ingredients in
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a 12th century magical text,
Sefer Raziel, which came originally from
[SPEAKER_08]: Jewish sources, but was very popular in
the medieval period in Europe,
[SPEAKER_08]: it has a recipe for a cannabis ointment
that's used for scrying in a mirror.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they would rub this cannabis-based
ointment with other herbal ingredients,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then they would look into a darkened
mirror until they saw a vision,
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of like looking in a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's interesting because right up
until the 19th century, there's these guys
[SPEAKER_08]: like Louis Halpon's Cahegnay and Dr.
Pascal Beverly Randolph and other
[SPEAKER_08]: occultists that were using cannabis in
exactly the same way as this 12th century
[SPEAKER_08]: reference to this cannabis ointment in the
Sefer Raziel.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's like 800 years of continued
use of this magical recipe of cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: that we know of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you consider that the agent
references to cannabis, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people have probably heard about,
where in fact Hebrew references to
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, then Moses becomes like a shaman
who ingests a psychoactive substance,
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis in this prayer, burns it on the
altar as an oil, and then he speaks to the
[SPEAKER_08]: Lord of the pillar of smoke over the
altar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an act of catenomancy,
which means to see visions in smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis was also used as that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would burn lots of cannabis,
along with frankincense and myrrh and
[SPEAKER_08]: other substances, and create this smoky
atmosphere that was both psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the smoke itself was the physical
element that the demons and stuff would
[SPEAKER_08]: take form in, like where they'd be able to
take shape in, where you'd be able to see
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: May have been just the effects of the
psychoactive properties mixed with the
[SPEAKER_08]: visuals of candles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all fits so well when you have
experienced psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've ever experienced a psychedelic,
and when I say a psychedelic, like for me
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really talking about like you took
an ecstasy pill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more along the lines of like,
you know, you obliterated your ego.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, you've eaten a quarter
ounce of mushrooms or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done some ayahuasca or smoked some
DMT or dropped some powerful LSD or
[SPEAKER_08]: something, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, ingested cannabis can be
really strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of these people were taking ingested
amounts that would knock you out even for
[SPEAKER_08]: a day or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heroic doses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they'd come back from that
experience with a vision and that would be
[SPEAKER_08]: considered reality, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Breeder Steve dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Breeder Steve dose, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he would take, do you remember his
friend Wayne?
[SPEAKER_08]: Way back, oh no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember they had a film container full
of just trikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wouldn't have been like 99% heads
because they didn't have access back then,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it probably would have been like,
you know, at least 30 or 40% heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a film container, so it was
many, many grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he just cooked it, put it into
brownies and him and Wayne shared the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they definitely like, Steve I think
lost 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or one of them was 27, one of them was 36,
like just unconscious.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember Kirsty telling me like,
she was like, had to check to see if Steve
[SPEAKER_06]: was breathing because he was just like not
moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have read a number of accounts of people
putting into a death-like coma through
[SPEAKER_08]: powerful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Extracts to the point that they've been
thought dead.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this book written in the 19th
century by this Dr. James Braid and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: trance and human hibernation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes to India and he sees factors
and they say, okay, I'm going to die and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be buried in the ground and
I'm going to be dug up in a few days from
[SPEAKER_08]: now and I'm going to come back to life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said that they were doing this by
taking powerful cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like this famous fact here trick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just knocked them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Knocked them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And your body, like William O'Shaughnessy,
writes about putting people into a state
[SPEAKER_08]: of catalepsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can actually move something and
it'll just stay like there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they got rigor mortis or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that he knows all the terms for
these words.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first anesthesia was in fact a
preparation of cannabis and wine in China
[SPEAKER_08]: about 100 AD.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that guy was performing operations and
stuff by knocking people out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yeah, you know, it's pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Goes to show you the power of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a friend who ate too much one time
and he was in the bathroom just having a
[SPEAKER_06]: bad trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was coming out of the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't even going to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just coming out of the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he got stuck in this position and he
was like, I can't move my arms.
[SPEAKER_06]: His arms were even up a little more or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember him like not being,
like even us trying to like push his arms
[SPEAKER_06]: down seemed like he was made of freaking
concrete.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually really not a good
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, it terrified him for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of freaked us out for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like that I would say for close to
an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'll show you this video later.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this video of this kid, Novus kid,
takes dabs with all his buddies,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he freezes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, he's frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, and then they go in there
and mess with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally they start tugging him and
then he starts to come.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, whoa, this isn't good,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was frozen in time.
[SPEAKER_08]: He totally freaks out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as he's freaking out,
he starts going back into it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, hey, he's doing it
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's totally legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it's funny because one of
the most amazing things about cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: when you first use it is this sense of
time distortion.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it seems like a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they're literally like freezing in
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I kind of think that there may
be some total relation with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: the conception of time because the grim
reaper, he holds a scythe.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ancient Scythian tool used for
harvesting cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And time kind of begins with agricultural
time when the seasons are growing and
[SPEAKER_08]: following that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's this whole time shift.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the pygmies in Africa, they say that
they've been cultivating cannabis since
[SPEAKER_08]: the dawn of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's more likely means their
conception of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the ways you can kind of
perceive of time is having the experience
[SPEAKER_08]: of differentiation in time where a second
seems like a minute or you know what I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would kind of help you
conceptualize the idea of time,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, just that kind of stone thought,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think the Congolese came from the
Pygmies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was and I also heard the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard Al the Alchemist tell the story
that it was it was it was meant to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: gift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Congolese was meant to be a gift.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got it, gift it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Pygmies say that God gave them
cannabis so that they would be healthy and
[SPEAKER_08]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we're all appreciative of
that gift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to try a dab of the bubble
hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm so high off that last one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll probably have to wait a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got pretty high off that last one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got really strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I kind of got mellowed out by the
second one.
[SPEAKER_06]: But here, I'll take this bubble hash one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I pop cannabis all day, vaporize
generally.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, I'm probably not like what
you call a heavy user.
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably go through about a gram and a
half a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if I'm at work smoking joints,
I smoke a couple of big joints or
[SPEAKER_06]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I definitely see that you puff
nonstop throughout your day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I spread it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to keep a good kind of stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I make my coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of keep that level of stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I find the dabs, you know, man,
it can just knock me out of commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good for an in-depth conversation
about what you love and what you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: though, because you've been doing some
pretty good rambles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been enjoying it myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to show you some other stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always appreciate all the stuff you show
and all the things you talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I admit, I know a lot about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the things maybe that I know
the most about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know almost anything about
everything you talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is a really interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got this for myself after I completed my
last book, Cannabis and the Soma Solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is, I had it made into a
necklace, is about a third century A.D.
[SPEAKER_08]: gold coin from Northern England.
[SPEAKER_08]: Northern India.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a Scythian gold coin because the
Scythians dominated in Northern India from
[SPEAKER_08]: about third century, third century B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: to the fourth century A.D.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on this side, it's a Scythian king and
he's all dressed up like Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the trident, he's got dreadlocks,
got a serpent there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's got his like, you know,
Shiva carries around his drug jar there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got his little basket there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Scythians actually embraced Shiva
when they showed up in India.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Shiva, of course, and they had the
love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Shiva, of course, is the lord of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shiva is thought to be an indigenous god
to India like Kali as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the Indian pantheon,
Krishna, Brahma, Vishnu, all these types
[SPEAKER_08]: of figures came with the Aryans who came
in and wrote the Vedas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And brought the best religion,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then these guys were adopted,
is the idea, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's interesting because those Stone
Age images of Shiva where he's like in
[SPEAKER_08]: lotus position and all the animals around,
I forget what it's called, but it looks
[SPEAKER_08]: like Stone Age images of Shiva.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have, there's one scholar who's
been comparing that to the Celtic stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: like the goose drop cauldron where there's
that Cyrano figure with the horns.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's got all the animals around him
and stuff and saying that this is all part
[SPEAKER_08]: of this same cultural complex.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with this recent news of the spread of
our Indo-European spread of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: which they're calling in the press the
birth of Western civilization through
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis culture and the first
agricultural cash crop cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: opening up the whole trade routes,
saying basically that the Silk Road was
[SPEAKER_08]: more of a hemp and highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes back thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that is true, then we're talking about
something so old, a religious kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: sacrament and herb that's just so old,
it goes right back.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like they're saying,
this spread happened about 5,000 years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago, Indo-European spread.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have examples of cannabis at Celtic
and Druidic sites and also up in China
[SPEAKER_08]: with Indo-Europeans there and in
Afghanistan and the Bactria Margiana,
[SPEAKER_08]: we have the evidence and then into India
with Soma that this is all just so old and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's so special that in this time we're
just kind of figuring it out as we're
[SPEAKER_08]: finding out about all these medical
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden this agent history is
starting to rise up and archaeologists and
[SPEAKER_08]: anthropologists are going that Western
civilization grew out of civilization.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Pearl Sagan said that cannabis was
likely our first agricultural crop and
[SPEAKER_08]: culture grew out of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dr. David Allen said that probably
the first human suckling on a brass was
[SPEAKER_06]: induced by that munchy effect that
cannabinoids produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like everywhere that we went when we
started cultivating this plant,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was growing in night soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Night soil is human waste and it literally
drew in our piss and shit and we were
[SPEAKER_08]: putting ourself back in that soil and it's
growing there and it's taking in all that
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff that's been through us and we're
ingesting it and then putting it back in
[SPEAKER_08]: the soil and you've got to think that
there's some sort of biological
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship here that's like,
you're calling some modern diseases
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like the more you study
pharmaceutical drugs, you realize that
[SPEAKER_06]: most of them are trying to do the job that
your endocannabinoid system would do
[SPEAKER_06]: naturally with essential amino acids and
cannabinoids, whether endogenously
[SPEAKER_06]: produced or inhaled through
phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, those get the job done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always said why when people are like,
oh, I saw that little girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was having all these seizures and then
they put the oil under her tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always say it really wasn't a miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an endocannabinoid deficiency and
then the cannabinoids are obviously
[SPEAKER_06]: very...
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if all your system did was put
your immune system and your central
[SPEAKER_06]: nervous system in homeostasis,
if that's all it did, that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible in its own right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything else that's going on and
all that we will learn in the next 10 and
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years of actually being able to study
the science of this while simultaneously
[SPEAKER_06]: uncovering the rich historical past.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like building a jigsaw
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_06]: From our perspectives, Chris and I have
been in the cannabis activism world for 20
[SPEAKER_06]: to 25 years, maybe Chris longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's like a better portion of our
lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more than half of our lives that
we've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to see this jigsaw puzzle that almost
started with just one little piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like whatever it was that made
us believe in that piece that made,
[SPEAKER_06]: even through all the propaganda before
Jack's book and before the learning and
[SPEAKER_06]: when people were telling us it was bad and
believing it, but feeling that it was
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: The feeling that there was something
intrinsically good in this... I would go
[SPEAKER_06]: out and hide in my shed in my backyard in
the freezing cold weather, 15 years old
[SPEAKER_06]: and smoke joints and just be like,
the feeling that it gave me and that
[SPEAKER_06]: connection that it gave me was so
important to my wellbeing and to the
[SPEAKER_06]: choices that I would later on make in life
that I can't even... Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the forbidden fruit syndrome.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that you're told in the garden,
don't eat that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you go eat it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, whoa, your eyes become open and
you kind of start to see the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: This fruit is so special.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like just any old fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that any old fruit is any old fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I started around 89, 90,
and I just have to say just how much it
[SPEAKER_08]: has proved itself over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each new medical discovery, each new
industrial use, and then all this history
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of starting to rise to the surface
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel blessed to have been a part of the
whole rising of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put this herb up into the mainstream
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like it's been a one-way street,
no matter what they try to throw at us to
[SPEAKER_06]: make it look like a 180, like we're going
the other direction, no matter what they
[SPEAKER_06]: throw at us from the 14th century Cairo
Sufis that had their teeth ripped out in
[SPEAKER_06]: the square for eating hashish to the
California grower in 1999, who he got
[SPEAKER_06]: busted three times, but he's going to keep
doing it because he believes in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just can't be stopped.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you pour concrete down,
and then it grows through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the highway to hell is paved,
it's one thing that's going to break its
[SPEAKER_08]: way through the pavement, and that's a
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an opportunity on so many levels for
humanity to go back that greener route
[SPEAKER_08]: because we can replace fossil fuels with
hemp fuels.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can make batteries out of this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can make all our clothes out of it and
move away from soil depleting cotton.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Paints and oils and all these other stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Consume it as a whole food.
[SPEAKER_08]: We make it more environmentally friendly
and biodegradable through the use of these
[SPEAKER_08]: plastics.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's endless paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: We cut down 50% of our trees for paper
these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to ask for our futures,
as Jello Biafra would say when he gave his
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp grant years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it's like this medicinal qualities of
it and everything we're just finding out
[SPEAKER_08]: about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Curing these little poor children of apple
up sea.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was thought to be demonic possession
back in the ancient world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis actually appears in ancient
recipes for the relief of what was
[SPEAKER_08]: believed to have been after the hand of
ghosts and other things it was called.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just so incredible to watch that
happen and see these parents who are
[SPEAKER_08]: losing their kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to die from all the
medications, and then they're living and
[SPEAKER_06]: starting to thrive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's heart wrenching for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also that then you get to the point
where you don't only help the sick people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually use it as a preventative
and prevent people from maybe having no
[SPEAKER_06]: seizures or having later on in life heart
disease and diabetes and stroke.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that consuming
cannabinoids can help prevent as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you get into that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we haven't even really touched on the
spiritual aspect of how it makes you feel
[SPEAKER_06]: and how it seems to connect you with
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I hear people call cannabis an
escape, I just think, wow, it really
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a circle naturally forms when
you pass a joint around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You light up the herbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: What other things do people pass from hand
to hand?
[SPEAKER_08]: That takes place.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's different ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: For Sufis and Sadhus, I think a lot of the
drive to using cannabis almost increases
[SPEAKER_08]: your attention to a level that's
meditative.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you can start to blow away your ego
and just get down to that common essence
[SPEAKER_08]: of us all and all the thoughts can drift
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could get lost staring at the
wallpaper for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually like a form of a trance.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all how you direct that energy
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Intense is everything with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're smoking blunts and dope and
listening to gangster hip hop,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're not really going to be getting the
same effect as a Sadhu who's partaking of
[SPEAKER_08]: his Chilam on the river Ganges.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can definitely say I've done both and
they are very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not putting anything, making any
judgment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not putting one over the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly saying that you will get very
different experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a magnifier.
[SPEAKER_08]: It magnifies wherever you're in and set
and setting and intent and all these
[SPEAKER_08]: things pay a role.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that I think if you take the
time to find out about the religious
[SPEAKER_08]: history of cannabis and the history of
this incredible plant, that will become
[SPEAKER_08]: part of your intent because everything you
know is what creates your intent.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you find out about this
incredibly magical spiritual tree of life,
[SPEAKER_08]: Soma, Haoma, the holy ganja of Shiva,
whatever you want to call it, the plant of
[SPEAKER_08]: immortality, the Chinese, the more it
cloaks itself in the magic and myth of our
[SPEAKER_08]: ancestors.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a good dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just loving it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's poetic, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking as Chris was on that last
end of his speech there that we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be doing some boosted boarding later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right after this, actually, we're going to
get on these boosted boards or maybe,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris has so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be able to do this, talk about this
plant that we love, the history of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: share it with you guys, but then go and do
a nice beautiful nature ride on an
[SPEAKER_06]: electric skateboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my meditation, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You inspire me, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be on these boards if it wasn't
for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're definitely ... Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad at 54 I'm still rocking stuff
like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a blessing and I think herb keeps you
young at heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: People tell me all the time, you look
young, you act young, you seem like a
[SPEAKER_06]: younger person.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, it's just take care of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, I'll show you these 19th century
chillums and a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, take care of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay attention to your diet, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you're eating the best quality
food that you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are 19th century chillums and in the
center there's a sadu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes these sadus will do things to
show ... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sadistic, but they'll do things like
hold their arm up to show the power of
[SPEAKER_08]: their will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I met a guy like that at the Kumbh
Mela.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy's arm has a trophy in this
position, but there he is with a chillum.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an old postcard.
[SPEAKER_08]: How old is that though, do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is probably like 1920s or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, because that's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to go through my pictures
because the picture of the guy I met at
[SPEAKER_06]: the Maha Kumbh Mela had been holding his
arm up for some insane amount of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be wild if it was him,
90 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he looked like he was more like 60,
but that's India too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got all these really great 19th
century books as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is called Keefe, A Life Story in Nine
Phases.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a story of a guy, the astral travels
well on cannabis and starts having an
[SPEAKER_08]: affair with another man's wife on the
astral plane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: The illustrations from it are just
fabulous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I have a couple of them printed up
here, but I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a really fascinating little book
and it's got great illustrations of people
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here they are puffing down before they get
off on the astral plane there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've got all sorts of cool books
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been researching a lot about magic
and cannabis and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuffed by this guy, Pascal Beverly
Randolph, who was the first huge
[SPEAKER_08]: commercial importer of hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been an interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an impressive title.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_08]: First big commercial importer of hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got all these old advertisements for
his hashish and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Roja Krushan, which is a kind of secret
society, alchemical occult secret society.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were using cannabis in a lot of those
secret societies back then, particularly
[SPEAKER_08]: Roja Krushan groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Randolph, he had two extracts he was
making from really good hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the sounds of it, it almost sounds
like one was more of a CBD type of thing
[SPEAKER_08]: and one was more of a THC thing because
they had different properties and effects
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He spread a lot of cannabis around up
until about 1875.
[SPEAKER_08]: A really fascinating guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another guy, Pascal Beverly Randolph,
has this book, Sanctuary of Spiritualism.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got 15 first-hand accounts of people
ingesting three grams of hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do it in Turkish coffee in order to
stir it in, real gooey hashish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drink it down and then they'd have these
super powerful experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: The person afterwards would write down
their experience and this makes up this
[SPEAKER_08]: book.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 15 first-hand accounts.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just really interesting visions and some
of the ideas that they're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: that were coming to them in these states
really parallels ideas like quantum
[SPEAKER_08]: physics and other things that we're
finding out in science.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting just how deep a knowledge
you can get from that sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: introspection and even more so sometimes
with the use of substances like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm inspired.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready to go ride Boosted Boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to bring my camera so
you guys can catch a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_06]: vibes on the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't bring my GoPro, but I'll hold my
video camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me over, Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a pleasure, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for watching and stick
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to go Boosted Boarding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are out in front of Chris' place.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the electric boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one you got there?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Evolve Bustin' Deck.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great board.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I like about these boards is they've
got the double bushing trucks like the old
[SPEAKER_08]: Gullwings, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're really carby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dual bushings.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it gets a lot of range just when I get
about 15 miles on, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: if it's pretty steady terrain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, nice flexy deck, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this one beside me is the
Boosted.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had it on here before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really solid build.
[SPEAKER_08]: They got a really nice, tight electronics
and brakes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The brakes are just a little looser.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not as carby, but better for high speeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say this is my main commuter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm driving in the city,
it's the board I drive to work on and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that because it can stop really
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It stops late.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got a lot of torque for going up
the hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: Real limited range.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably about four or five miles for a
guy my weight 200 pounds, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's got its limitations.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, it's all about the carve for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to carve it out when I'm going down
a hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really nice and light and you can
really melt some range out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Downside, the way they got the motor set
up, these motor plates have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_08]: snap.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got to take it careful over any
brakes in the cement.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want real smooth cement for this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've also got an all-terrain setup and
the all-terrain setups great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Air tires and handles gravel roads,
bumps and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got their latest version coming soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got dual motor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will be a dual motor, all-terrain
skateboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's great for driving right over
train tracks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And still got a lot of speed and a lot of
range.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm ready to hit the road if you
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, me too man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble man, set up the machine.
