[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so what is this I have is this
barb or hay oma?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hay oma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, is this the one I cleaned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks really nice just on the rim
here greased right out though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You looking for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Two dabbers right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the ceramic disc.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's on the dabber right in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it'll be almost cold now that ceramics
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting it out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry sift cleaned the fuck up on the
ceramic dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ready where you are man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready.
Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this room is all the Kanatonic CBD high
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got Afghani, Digweed, Warlock,
and Renee in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them we have multiple
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's have a look at them and you can
see which one you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here sits the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got a short Christmas tree,
Indica, all the way, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to create a high CBD version.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we crossed it with the Kanatonic they
saw upstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have two phenotypes here of the
Afghani crossed with the Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Afghani Kanatonic number
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Afghani Kanatonic number six.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see this one's a little bit more
short.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bed structure is similar to the bed
structure of the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas this one shows, this one shows,
you know, side branching out sort of the
[SPEAKER_04]: main stock and more of the Kanatonic
traits that like we saw upstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when choosing, you know, which one is
going to be the Afghani Kanatonic or CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani, right now our bet is right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting and that's just from how it
looks and how it grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the final one will be sort of how
it smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure that it smokes similar to
the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as long as it does, then sort of
the CBD Afghani will be born.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we know it already does.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it was choose and we're down to
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started with 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like them right side by side too.
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones are definitely a little bit
taller and have that more pronounced cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these we haven't topped,
but some of them we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one we never topped, this one we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see this one has four large
tops or this one that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: In another room, I'll show you a top
versus non-top experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in this room has been topped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them haven't been topped.
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole table hasn't really been
topped.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a good experiment in the other
room to show it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the difference in the color of the
leaves there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The light green.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of the intensity off of the
adjuster wings.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be two strips that go down where
it's just, it gets enough of the crossover
[SPEAKER_04]: light that that strip requires a little
bit more nutrient than say down the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: strip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried everything to raising the
lights, lowering the lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can raise the lights within the
adjuster wings.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can squeeze the adjuster wings in and
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always end up with those two strips,
but oh well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we really get the advantage of
the adjuster wings because the adjuster
[SPEAKER_04]: wing hits the adjacent table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas normally you would have a wall
here to get the light to come here and
[SPEAKER_04]: bounce and come back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well here it bounces off of that and comes
over here and this one bounces and comes
[SPEAKER_04]: over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a great experiment to sort of
show how many tables you can do and sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of gain light by adding tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got our Afghanis and we've got
our Afghani Kanatonix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got our Diggweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the Diggweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is the Diggweed?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Diggweed is a sweet tooth cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a member of the Vancouver
Anticapacit Society.
[SPEAKER_04]: He started up a couple sweet tooth seeds
and he ended up getting two really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One ended up becoming the Pochi,
which is a very popular strain at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he ended up giving us the other
one and we loved it just because of its
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor and its structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super thick stalks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can really hold its weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up taking that sweet tooth and
then crossing it with that Afghani that
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys saw over there to try to give it
a little bit more of that Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_04]: structure and strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it got its name because Diggweed
the cat, it's his favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a famous cat that's known to trim
buds and he has a good old time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is his strain, Diggweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we crossed that with the
Kanatonix to get some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is the only phenotype that made
it all the way through the gauntlet to the
[SPEAKER_04]: end.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, you know, looking like Diggweed,
finishing, growing, everything that sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of Diggweed is and has the CBD marker in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the Diggweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a little extra Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we come down here,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have the CBD Warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually the phenotype that I
don't particularly like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really have the Warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that sort of diesel-y gasoline
petroleum sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so greasy and it's such an amazing
flavor and taste and feel to have a CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: Warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really has to have all these traits to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have another one that's not here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at another room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit better, but it's,
it still has, you smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still has that, it has the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not, it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on this table, we have the Renee,
the end of the Renee project.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely gonna be stoked on Renee as
always.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have Renee number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Renee number seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one isn't, this one doesn't have the
CBD marker for it, but it's, it was such a
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful plant that we had to keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have the CBD marker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it doesn't have the CBD marker,
but it's such a beautiful cross between
[SPEAKER_04]: the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we just had to keep the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see, you can see how beastly it
is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is the RC 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: RC 11?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see, so if you zoom in,
if you sort of zoom in on those tops,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll see that, you know, they're not
very small and the hairs don't really
[SPEAKER_04]: extend like I want them to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now if you come over to like this one,
this one's the seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how it has that sort of
snowball effect to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even, and then even the number two,
the number two, it's not, it's not as good
[SPEAKER_04]: as the, or as the number seven,
but it's just, it's the way that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: stacked and the healthiness of the plant
compared to the 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are both Renee's?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both Renee's and they're both high
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just got to figure out which one's
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Renee sure has an amazing terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, this room will finish up in the
next four weeks and then I guess we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or John Conroy will, or Kurt Tusa,
the great lawyers in our community will
[SPEAKER_04]: get the injunction and get us our personal
grow rights back because, because look at
[SPEAKER_05]: all the great work you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll actually take, say those two
Afghanis and we'll give them to the
[SPEAKER_04]: members of the club and let them choose,
let them choose which one's best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they want to tell you that you
can't grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked your analogy earlier of,
uh, you know, you can't, you can't make
[SPEAKER_05]: food at home anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's illegal to make food.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's illegal to make food at your home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have to go buy it in a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the analogy to what the MMAR
cancellation is, is you can't buy food
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore or you can't make food at home
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use your stove at home anymore
because your stove is a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the capabilities of burning your
house down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to burn the community down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go out and you have to take
your family to a restaurant every single
[SPEAKER_04]: night and eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single day, every single breakfast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a little more expensive,
but, uh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be safer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safer for the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great, that's a great,
that's a great, uh, plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta, I gotta say, I feel pretty safe
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in this garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: The house of the great gardener can't go
away and nor can any of the other Canadian
[SPEAKER_05]: growers who have licenses and are licensed
to either grow for themselves or friends,
[SPEAKER_05]: family, loved ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have these rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be able to access this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, we need to have it
be an open gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can't corral it into such a
small amount of companies because you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: inevitably turn the gene pool into a,
into a bit of a trailer park.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you just regulate the clubs,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The clubs that are existing already
service tens of thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, why are you not just regulating the
clubs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just, you're just a ridiculous
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, the only people that can
access it are people that have millions
[SPEAKER_04]: and tens of millions of dollars that could
build these super sophisticated systems to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow a plant that's already been helping
people for millennia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you need to really, you need to
really grow it in a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, these aren't pharmaceutical
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you grow your tomatoes in a super
sterile lab?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then irradiate them and then send them
back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grind them into pulp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make your own alcohol?
[SPEAKER_04]: Make that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make that at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make beer at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make, you know, why, why can't,
why can't people just grow their own
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why we, why, why do you allow people to
grow medicine for 12 years and then all of
[SPEAKER_04]: a sudden say, man, you can't do that
anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the bottom line is it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to fight it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's going to allow this to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government has to sort of give their
head a shake and realize that it's fine to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring in licensed producers, but not at
the expense of personal production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not at the expense of personal
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for walking us through this,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, uh, I got my fingers crossed for,
well, for all of us, but for you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you get to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: One country or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it's Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can meet up in Uruguay if it worst
comes to the worst.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard something go click.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a can of tonic room coming,
waking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This room is full of experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first two tables have been topped and
then the second two tables were left
[SPEAKER_04]: alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the second table we've gone
through and sort of moved buds around to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure they're all the same height.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of using the screen, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: As right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see how it's just like,
Oh, it's four.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nugget.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clickety click.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have things like this in here,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just messing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you hit the whole, took the whole bud
and tilted over like that one over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting all the side buds disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that one over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the side buds turn up and be
their own.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one's even nicer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stair casing nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Versus those ones where we just left them
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Left them natural way, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all can of tonic again?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem is that this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get the stakes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stake them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure looks nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: All this Nug.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, it just seems like I was in here just
a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many more weeks left in here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting to fat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another four weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another four weeks, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll take us to like March 25th or 26th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're going to roll it all up in
kitty litter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to demo how to destroy
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do a demo like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people though.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you take your cannabis and grind it
up, put it in water and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get the exact sort of slurry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get the right slurry up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you take it down to the police
station and you ask them what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do with it now?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just give it to them and you think
it's a dangerous product.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be a great protest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is how ridiculous that it all
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it with shake though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it with like stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How ridiculous, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut down April 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get rid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: March 31st you're allowed your three month
supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1st you're only allowed to have 150
grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're supposed to destroy all your
medicine that you grew and then buy it at
[SPEAKER_04]: five to 12 dollars a gram from an LP.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like almost cruel to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cruelty to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day they.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not almost cruel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sadistic and it's sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: To give you a memo that tells you the
process of taking cat litter and mixing it
[SPEAKER_04]: with water and mixing your cannabis in
with that and destroy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whose job was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That must have been a sad day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know another way of destroying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should go try some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go smoke some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah let's go destroy some cannabis resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt and I are going to show you how to
properly destroy your medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: The great gardener and bubble man way.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the way that we rock when we're doing
nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the natural high that the UTH brings.
The real thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the way that we rock.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the natural high that the UTH brings.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the way that we rock when we're doing
nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the natural high that the UTH brings.
It's the way that we rock when we're doing
nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the natural high that the UTH brings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back with the great gardener and we're
about to lift up the dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a little bit of hay oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been running for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy look at this sift stuck on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a seed run.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great smell though.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have run it for the 10 minute and
the 1 hour run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get all the seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we have all the seed out of it then
we throw all the plant material back in
[SPEAKER_04]: here for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: What grade comes out of here we use for
medibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just turn that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh there's a green.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hay oma.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hay oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hay oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: The name comes from Chris Bennett's new
book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hay oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of the hay oma, soma cults or tribes
of ancient times comes from sort of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Tien Shin mountain range.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This image here is actually a cave
painting in the Tien Shin mountain range
[SPEAKER_04]: that comes from the soma hay oma tribes
which are some believe are the original
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis farmers that made the potent
strata.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see they're not wasting any
parts of the plant here at the house of
[SPEAKER_05]: the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything right down to the last little
bit is used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collecting seed, collecting resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here with Matt the great gardener
and some of his secret private reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you tell us what's going on here
Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we have everything in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mostly our fresh frozen
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannotonic Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find things like microplane versus
sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find things like sweet skunk
99.9% gland heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find barber bud and JT15 and
hay oma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got MP5.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the microplane?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, MP for microplane, the size,
the date should be on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: JT15.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be microplained.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the new ones I'll mark either
sieve or the dark that one is,
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other one that's dark like
that, the JT.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the early sieve techniques where
there was a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still trapped in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went really dark compared to... Just
let me go grab the sweet skunk ones.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice big bags of sieve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here comes some sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming through, coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet skunk, it's the wrong section.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it should be, sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this one, because we waited a
little longer for our patties to dry
[SPEAKER_04]: before we sifted them, I just want to find
the same size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sift 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking for, 90?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plain 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whereas the other one, the sieve was
darker, we've got it to a point where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the microplane is a little bit
lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not such a dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one looks nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate both their textures and their
colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know this, when I look at a hash up
close like this and I want to smoke it,
[SPEAKER_05]: then everything's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's smoke some, shall we?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't be right next to a freezer full
of hash this nice and not just smoke a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get back to a bunch of
puffing and we'll catch you in a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventy-three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventy-three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that the 73 with the 90 bag or the
aka real 73 pre-90 bag?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before I added the 90 micron bag,
all the 90 micron hash used to go into the
[SPEAKER_05]: 73 bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of us that used to make it
back in the day, that now the 90 came
[SPEAKER_05]: along and it really lobbed the 73 of a lot
of what made it special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically we call the 73 that's
pre-90 micron bag, we call it the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's got all that 90 in it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a hint of the 90 and the 73 and
that's the real 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like we pulled sweet skunk 73
microplained out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very light color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just put it next to the dry sifts
here to show you kind of the different
[SPEAKER_05]: colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, two dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Haoma 99.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Haoma 99 and this one is Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's an Afghani Haoma mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely have more of a yellowish look
to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, these never were exposed
to water and they were never frozen for
[SPEAKER_05]: that matter either.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was both, this was made with water
and also frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically kept in the freezer after
probably out on cardboard for what,
[SPEAKER_05]: a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's dab it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Checking out a little Barbara.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is some Christeny shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Barb right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All Barb right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Afghani in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani cross with the John D seed in it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to change my, my white
balance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go white balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty, frosty trikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big fat nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sort of main cola.

[SPEAKER_04]: And how did you fem these?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_04]: STS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just brushed it on?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I sprayed it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sprayed it on through liquid?
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of weeks before flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or actually I'll spray it on, throw that
plant into flowering for a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: and then flower the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ready.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are white rhino.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are made in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: The oldest seed I ever held, I was at
Skunkman Sam's house and he came out and
[SPEAKER_05]: he put this little jar, like a little jar
like that, in my hand and basically it was
[SPEAKER_05]: the seeds from that mummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the 4,000 year old seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you feel like you have a lot of
power almost in the seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, man, it's all right there,
the genetic lineage of so many different
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
