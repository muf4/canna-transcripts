[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Remo, the urban grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for having me over once
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a beautiful platter of awesome
variety here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six varieties, three on top, three on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All killer and lucky me today I brought my
Trippy Stick herbal unit so I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: able to try out each one of these herbs
which I believe you grew with your new
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all grown with Ramo nutrients and
we've had some fantastic results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well I have to say it looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to dip in for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite excited to try the two that I
passed your way but also I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to try that headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, that's my new favorite and
I think this stuff could win a cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually that's probably going to be my
entry into any cups I enter this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it, it's kind of got a
silver kind of tone to it, lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, unbelievable flavor,
unbelievable smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the best producer in the world but
potency-wise pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it kicks you in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's saying a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Ramo's saying that it kicks you in the
face, that means it's definitely a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an ex-broker's perspective,
it looks like that herb that you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that was always a pleasure to
have a Hollywood herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looky here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that, you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I have to put my hand in the
background to get it to clear out like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well why don't you pick the
first one that we're going to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's right for the favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll only need a tiny little bit so maybe
put a tiny little bit in the grinder for
[SPEAKER_01]: me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here I'll let you take a hit and
I'll throw the rest in the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean it fits a decent amount but
nothing compared to the giant fat joint
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ramo's about to roll, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it easy today because I got to
do all these six and probably in a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like a sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they have it with wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a name for this though.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smorgasbord.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smorgasbord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should have a sneeze guard out and a
little basket of every kind of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, buffet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently lit with some fluorescent light so
you can examine the buds before smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to just stuff it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going, trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really, well, many, many people
will see this video and say, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble man, you're smoking herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never smoke herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not smoke herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that I don't love herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love herb because it brings me the resin
and how I choose most of the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire that resin is through the
mechanical separation using strings or
[SPEAKER_01]: through the ice water extraction method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is merely a third method of
extracting resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hot air extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll one, two, three, four the button.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hold it down for four seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light goes on and she starts climbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can you get one of these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trippy Sticks sells them on their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also starting to carry them at
bubblebag.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a new vaporizer company that
I'm absolutely, not a company,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, but there's a company that is
selling vaporizers from many different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe they carry it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe their name is Wizard,
Wizard Bros or Wizard Puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know in the near future
because they've sent me a couple of units
[SPEAKER_01]: that they want me to do reviews for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got this from Emilio down in LA,
the owner of Trippy Sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been supporting these guys for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what, particularly to me,
because it's not like when you have a big
[SPEAKER_01]: joint of something awesome, it's not that
I don't want to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I don't smoke that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: More for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I really want to try
all these different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the trippy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like immediate strong Kush flavors,
but something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just hangs on the lips,
the vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed both of us are getting slightly
different experiences from him smoking the
[SPEAKER_01]: joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene profile, the cannabinoid
profile is going to be different for him
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is for me through the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet we're both hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hitting the same string.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff kind of takes my breath away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're smoking this and while you're
vaping, which one do you want to try next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's go right over to the kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give my boys Don and Aaron a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's where these seeds originated
from, DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was just a standard pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you'd have to smoke this weed to
see how good it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't believe how it produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my top producing strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a message to Aaron today from DNA
when Remo was telling me a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about his harvest from the kosher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron was stoked, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was sorry that he missed Remo while he
was here in BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo was over at Sunbeaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, next year, if we do it again,
we'll make sure we all go to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll rip up some slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rip it up, I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of different levels of skiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave had never been skiing ever in his
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim was a pretty good snowboarder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron was a pretty good skier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both Matt and Sarah were pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all able to stay in a group and
not really like separate too badly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the fun times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, such good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hitting the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing about going skiing is
the chairlift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I go up the chairlift,
I smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think skiing and snowboarding are
definitely stoners for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Designed for you, almost, when you really
think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, designed for our people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally, I have to admit,
I am also very guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, sometimes when it's a more
miserable day, you've got a real storm
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go down to Mid Station just to get
on the Gandhi so we can have a session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gonjola, we like to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the gonjola.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, of course, the excuse that Ross
was able to use, Ross Rebliati,
[SPEAKER_01]: when he was stripped of his gold medal in
Japan in 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was the secondhand smoke from the
gonjola.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he blamed, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to smell this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got some unique turpentines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, almost, I don't know,
it's a sweet, sharp smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's throw some of that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, how'd you like the first one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a very strong, surprisingly,
for vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, keep in mind, for me, vapor,
sure, after I sit here and chain vapor for
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour with Remo through six to 10
varieties, I'll have the kind of high that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I often get that in just a couple of
rips of dry sift or wet wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I consider vaporizing, especially out
of a smaller unit like this, more for
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, for the enjoyment of the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I literally, after one session on
that, feel pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, no, that is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is medicine in the sense that
you could tell that that is a pain
[SPEAKER_01]: reliever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we go on the kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it up for a rip, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the kosher has a more earthy taste,
if I could explain the two kush tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This first one, when I tasted it,
for whatever reason, when I was tasting
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the word platinum came to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, oh, this is like platinum
kush or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just so, such a nice, silky,
silvery, this one here is deeper in its
[SPEAKER_01]: earth tones, through the vapor,
at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the difference would be
through smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's got a sweet taste to it when
you smoke it, but it's very complex at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got other flavors in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vapor changed a little bit as well as,
of course, what you'll notice with a
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer like this, particularly when
you're using herb like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Remo has not dried this herb out to
bone dry because that would be very
[SPEAKER_01]: unenjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke a bone dry herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harsh and terrible, falls apart,
you lose resin glands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the moisture content
is, but it's nice and marshmallowy and
[SPEAKER_01]: well-cured for smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she's snapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure she's snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put this by the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't mean that it's wet in
any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean generally when you're... Oh,
you don't want it crispy, crispy,
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: For smoking, whereas for dry sifting and
for vaporizing... Making hash would be
[SPEAKER_01]: good, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, having it pretty dry is not such a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the trichomes would fall off a lot
easier when it's crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn up the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just turned down on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back up you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back up you go a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot does that thing get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never set it up past just 400
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC seems to vaporize around 300 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 387 or 390 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: 406 I haven't set at Fahrenheit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at 454 it actually ignites and
lights on the fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see me dump this, it won't even
be very discolored because I keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature a little bit lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like that Mexican we used to
get in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That color there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except there would be a shitload of seeds
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, sun dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it doesn't fall out good,
then there's still more to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to light up the next joint,
otherwise I'm not going to be able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: up with you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt that will ever be a reality,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that thing consumes faster than
this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because you're consuming much more
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each joint for you is probably four or
five of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting in a pinner's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've smoked like two grams since we set
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be ready for lunch after we're done
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you are going to be ready for lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be... Black Sheep Pub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the cheesesteak
sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, American cheesesteak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to steal Panther.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little 80s metal for you in the year 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seen them six times before they kicked
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good fun, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I haven't been to a
concert in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get out more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like going to the Commodore,
and this is the number one reason I like
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Commodore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually blaze in there and they leave
you alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Commodore's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an amazing situation there for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend worked for Sirius XM Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: The front booth at the Commodore next to
the stage, right in front of the backstage
[SPEAKER_01]: door, was their booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sponsored it, so it was their booth
for every show of every day of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it had a little thing around it,
and so my friend, who basically was in
[SPEAKER_01]: charge of getting those tickets,
she got six tickets, which was one seat at
[SPEAKER_01]: each seat in the booth, for every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every month, she got hundreds of
tickets to the Commodore, and she'd just
[SPEAKER_01]: show me the list, and I'd be like,
oh, Lee Scratch Perry, I'll go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Franti, I'll go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unbelievable, for the longest time,
the Commodore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you know this about the
Commodore, you know that showing up really
[SPEAKER_01]: late, unless you've got a group of friends
and you know where they are, is a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in the ass at the Commodore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those places that you show up
early, you roll in with a crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: you sit down, you get your table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you clean your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clean your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move around at that point,
but you have your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the home base at the
Commodore, man, the place gets packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can roll in at 11.30 at night,
walk up to that booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just say to the security guard,
hey, can you open that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a bank thing, with a little
red velvet rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in we go with a pile of people,
free tickets, you know, 50, 60,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even sometimes $80 concert tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd give me six of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like the Commodore was my living
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about two and a half years,
it felt like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, those cushions were nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the most beautiful flavor of both of
them right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back of my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both of those I consider to be
completely top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, on this whole plate,
those might be my two favorite flavors on
[SPEAKER_00]: this plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would believe that, you know,
even if someone were to ask me what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think Remo would like out of these three,
I would literally write right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_01]: go these three right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You picked the... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my three favorites out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are all star cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want me to be wrong, but this
medicates me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these have a little bit... Well,
I don't know about this one, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an unknown to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these two in general are a much more
euphoric and almost a head high in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the sweet skunk here,
and you've got the C99, the Cinderella 99,
[SPEAKER_01]: which produces that racy effect of the
Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of a kind of get-your-mind spinning
than a get-your-back at ease, which I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: it with both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting you're talking about
these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are a lot more floral in aroma
than these three here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very cush-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that very dank, cush smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, especially the silent sweet
skunk, it stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is stinky stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just said it right there, and we'll
learn in the future, and I guarantee you
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's not this exact thing, it'll be
very close to it, that that smell that
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo's describing, that musty cushy
dankness that we get, that is literally
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is whatever terpene profile that is,
or cannabinoid terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the smell of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems as though these more
florally, more like exotic sativa ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a whole other variety of
benefits that they offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that they get my mind racing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really ... Oh, they're definitely
speedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love that smell of the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was grown with an LED light too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you were saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which LED light did you use for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, originally the LED light was called
Sunlight LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I have one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it a big, crazy thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big black thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the company changed their name to
... Was it in a lawsuit or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if there's a lawsuit,
but they changed the name of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veggie was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tried to do is grow a big
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy warned me, don't get this
light closer than two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because the plant kept growing,
I kind of had to push the plant off the
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: That big black one that goes out like
this, did it touch the light and get
[SPEAKER_01]: burned?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it got, I don't know, at the end,
maybe eight, 10 inches away, and still
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't burning or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying, because that light
to me feels very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like comparably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to the other LEDs in the
market, it's got a great color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was white light, which is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're doing another test with one that
came from Lush Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that one as well, the XL Dominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I went to Seattle, to the
Seattle Cannabis Cup, and I met this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: from Christian Farms, and he smoked some
weed that was growing with Lush Light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could definitely grow good buds
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it with my own eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got one of these lights,
and we're putting it to the test right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a veg with them, beautiful veg,
and now we're making buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this video will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can check out Remo's channel for
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not miss that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to do the same thing with my
Lush Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do Lush on one side,
HPS on the other, have three plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same three plants under each light,
and then have the same three plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: between both lights capturing both lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that would be a really neat way
to capture what the LED light did,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the HPS light did, and what the
combination of them did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because constantly in all of these reviews
and comparatives, people are always
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, oh, I'd rather do this than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to a point in my life where I
prefer a quiver over a single arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best, greatest way to do it,
the best light bulb, the best this,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, who doesn't want a quiver?
[SPEAKER_01]: A variety of... I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I look at it is like being a
mechanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have all the tools and all
the latest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A variety of tools is definitely
essential, you know, to get a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: variety such as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one do you want to try next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess we'll just go right along
the way to the Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit this one last because
it's the one I'm most anxious for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the stinkiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real favorite of a lot of people
that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lemony smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the Congo, but...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't disappointed, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Skunk is great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the density of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put those two side by side,
I'd say the Sweet Skunk might even have
[SPEAKER_01]: that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, definitely not in density,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Skunk, they're a little bit of an
airy-fairy bud, but I had stuff like buds
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as they are of a Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely doesn't grow like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see those G13 buds there at Week
6?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting some, what do we call them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana swords?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, swords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swords we do battle with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely club-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis swords.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is the Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grind it up, it's kind of got an
interesting smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of sour in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it a little bit of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of reminds me of wheat from Europe,
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: European.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a lot of the European strains kind
of have that... It sure has a white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: ...has that tone to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the lime green, broken up like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get just giant, big, frosty buds on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe the size of the buds
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of reminds me of that Jamaican strain
that was around a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jack, the Jamaican, Sugar Bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many names does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons!
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it fool's gold because it used to
grow these giant buds, but you get immune
[SPEAKER_00]: to this weed almost right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had lots of trichomes on it,
but it just was not strong weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can grow buds the size of your
head, but that's why I prefer the cushions
[SPEAKER_00]: to make big buds, but it kicks your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really interested in what produces
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in what works the best for
myself anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key difference for yourself
because a lot of people that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to grow big buds, if they don't
have that head space of requiring real
[SPEAKER_01]: strength to ease their pain or whatever it
is for them that they get out of using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whether it's a recreational or a
preventative or a medicinal, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the potency like this,
generally most people that look to find
[SPEAKER_01]: these big giant plants that you can grow,
throughout my history anyway, tons of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are just not potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You break the mold on that because you're
not just looking to grow big buds to ship
[SPEAKER_01]: them off into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing for yourself and it's not
like you don't want just a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You require a heavy narcotic pain relief
and that's what those cushions really
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not as strong as the Headband
or the Kosher Kush or even that OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd say if I had to give it a mark of
maybe a 6.8, maybe not quite a 7,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are 9s and 10s I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice hit to the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good amount came out right away too,
which always tells me a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: the resin that's on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what would be interesting is
actually to test all these strains and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how much THC they actually have and what
the cannabinoid profile is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much CBDs, CBNs, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you know what, I bet you the two of
us, between testing the resin and you
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the plant matter and resin,
that we could pretty much nail it down
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least where the strongest lay and where
the sort of weakest lay and where the
[SPEAKER_01]: smelly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's simple things that we can do
through our bioassay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well these two right here, these are the
strongest, actually these three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your power hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice, it's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, it's very full smoke when
you have it combusted like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a complete flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've smelled quite a few whiffs from
your smoke as opposed to the taste of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor and it's an interesting way to add
to the palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes better than it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean, I'm not saying that
in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had strains that smell better than
they taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the air, you know, had this amazing,
crazy, beautiful, like exotic flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like spicy flavor and it's like,
I can't taste that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to taste that flavor, not just
smell it in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stuff here actually burns pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say the flame, or not the
flame, the color of the smoke with the
[SPEAKER_01]: light behind you is... Very dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's dark, but it's got that blue,
which I always sort of look for in a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis smoke, you know, as opposed to
that grayish smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope you guys are puffing tough
with us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that often that I get to come
over to Remo's and literally just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: puff tough video.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while he's smoking that joint,
I'm going to clear my palate with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a full melt dry sift that we made
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys went over to his channel
to check that out because that stuff's
[SPEAKER_01]: insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the shit that you're
literally using right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What better, easier way for you to acquire
your medicine than the spliffs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to take with you, they're not
connected to anything, you can walk around
[SPEAKER_01]: and have them anywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, you don't see me with my
D-nail up on the chairlift up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon there will be a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just give some stoner a little bit of
time and they'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stoner out there is working on it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like those Vietnam soldiers,
remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For their communication devices,
their two-way radio was a big backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got these little cell phones
that are this big that are computers that
[SPEAKER_00]: can get GPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weigh like six ounces.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a nice clear of my palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hitting dry sift that is like so
many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost had a bit of a fruity flavor in
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should hit that stuff again because it
will give you a chance to catch up on this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking big joints now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo, I'm taking little vapor hits,
you know, like a quarter of a gram to a
[SPEAKER_01]: half a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smoking like a gram and a half plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not going to complete these
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have the best half,
which is the first half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like wine tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be spitting into the bucket right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to smoke those down to
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will spark those up later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we'll be here forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, this audience loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do got to go to my office today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd love to take them along and give
a little look-see at whatever we can look
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the new warehouse, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty exciting times in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys like Remo are making moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting, you know, he's started
his own nutrient company and I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling it's going to be even more than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than just a nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we actually, we're going to expand,
hopefully, into medibles and maybe even to
[SPEAKER_00]: paraphernalia pipes, bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it open, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to see local people in
our community doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Remo does well, then many,
many, many people in the community do well
[SPEAKER_01]: because of course, you know, Remo hires
local people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully one day we'll be able to,
you know, employ maybe a hundred or more
[SPEAKER_00]: people here from Maple Ridge to work at
our warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dreaming big, but you got to think
big, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No reason to dream small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Dane Cook who said,
dream it, you fucking dreamer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic Dane Cook comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way he says it in the comedy skit,
he's like, if I'm dreaming, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a house and it's going to have
motes and it's going to have like lakes
[SPEAKER_01]: that go, like he's just going off on it
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why not, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what, that's basically the
metaphor is if you're going to dream
[SPEAKER_01]: something up for yourself, then why not
dream it as big and as good as you
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially, double especially when it's
something like what you just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: to hire a hundred people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've hit the headband kush, the kosher
kush, the Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now let's go back into some potency
for the OG kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this down, went and talked on the
phone, came back and look, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: burning beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have to relight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's definitely impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have chemi schwaggy food in your
herb, that definitely right there does not
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're doing this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every puff you're taking, you're lighting,
you're doing the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes me back to high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel how hard that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I already squeezed the tip of this
nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could smash a window with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smash this with a hammer and it
wouldn't flatten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, that was never,
that was hung dry too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually when you hang dry a plant,
it dries a little bit looser, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it just produces such rock hard
indica buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think OG kush is just like
one of those old school favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old gardener, I tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always excited to hit a little OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to get into the astro
boy and the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, probably have a couple of rips of
this dry sift in between and just be like
[SPEAKER_01]: super thankful to be able to chill here
with Remo, blaze through his varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke his dry sift, photograph his garden
and get to share his company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this has the bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better take some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These OGs man, I'll tell you, they really
were game changers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first it was the diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when someone came up with
that New York city diesel and it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I grew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made beautiful big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow short plants with super giant coals
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I guess there's been so many game
changers over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really the original game changer
would probably be a skunk man,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam's skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The skunk number one is the reason I
started growing cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that basically changed
everything here on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changed everything in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really responsible for a lot
that happened in Amsterdam and why I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's coincidence that the fact that
he was there with his strain, that
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam blew up in the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of the coffee shops in the late
eighties and the early nineties were that
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very, very, very pronounced
strain in every, and if it wasn't and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were calling it something else,
it would, you'd smell it and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's some skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember our choices back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go get some brown Mexican weed
that they called Cambodian or Thai weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you knew it was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was full of C's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking mid eighties, early
nineties?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking mid eighties, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid eighties, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had this stuff they called
BC red hair, which was a bunch of outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just didn't have any names for us
and they called it red hairs because it
[SPEAKER_00]: had lots of stigma hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came the skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skunk weed there, I remember it came
around and they were charging $40 an
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth and it was wet, sticky weed,
but it smelled like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd smoke it and get you way higher
than any of that stuff put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I couldn't really justify
paying $40 for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, that's kind of
what made me consider growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the roadkill skunk is different from
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one day I'll, I'll do a show on it
or something because I also remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my herbal unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a habit.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never be sorry for handing me a joint,
my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, there's some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm falling behind again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get this OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just enjoying that cookies though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoked it down almost down to a roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's OG without a shadow of a
doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I don't know, smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got very, the turpenides are very
floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sure taste them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sure can taste them after when you hit
the vapor on your lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should try a little tiny hit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been loving all your flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste on the lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be able to, like for me to be able
to taste all these varieties and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice head space on them and experience the
profiles wirelessly without like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I'm really just stoked on
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked on all these companies right
now that are producing all these great
[SPEAKER_01]: little units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a touch with Volcano recently and
they've got new little wireless units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have one of those coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called the Mighty and I'll be
doing a review on that soon to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically what I'm looking for in
a unit is obviously many, many pulls,
[SPEAKER_01]: an easy charge that it's, you know,
easy to handle and hold and doesn't break
[SPEAKER_01]: easy, but also that there's no plastic or
rubber or any type of that taste in the
[SPEAKER_01]: herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause to me, that's like a game ender.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's got a weird taste where it's like,
Oh, well they used a strange component or
[SPEAKER_01]: the rubber wasn't the highest end rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like, you know, the little rubber
containers that a lot of people were using
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to affect the taste and
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gassing some sort of weird toxin
into your body as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that nice tastier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how portable this unit is and I
like how portable, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: letting medicating becomes cause you can
be on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be out dirt biking and doing this
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a situation where I could
see this working for Remo in a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, he's at a concert or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smoking a joint and for whatever
reason, the guy, the security guard says,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you can't do that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he just puts the joint down and
pulls this out of his pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep blazing my joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you do, but it would be a nice
backup, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess for backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an investor's meeting, maybe that would
be the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not down with you whipping up big
bags of weed and roll up joints in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of those meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be because that's really what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I've been to Bay street
now and, uh, well, the whole, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about the whole weed industry and
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having Bay street and
legitimate investors get involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will help legalize and make it
legitimate for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of the things when your company
really has this exponential growth that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's going to have, and you guys
have your lab and your scientists working
[SPEAKER_01]: for different, you know, to tweak the
nutrients in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that one of the things that you
guys do is figuring out a way to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say manipulate,
but say increase or make more available,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is that the plant requires to
produce the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could figure out a way to tune
nutrients to resin growth and phenol and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene production inside the gland head
before cannabinoids are even cooked into
[SPEAKER_01]: existence, I think the advantage there
will be enormous, tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really see that I, I, I get excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking that, you know, someone like you
could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, we have to, you know,
do research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of learning,
but I think so as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that focusing on the
vegetative structure of the plant is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce the best medicine in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we'll have to focus our,
our focus on or change our focus onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm focused on is a resin and
definitely a lot of trichomes on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's cause you're an end user and
that's the best thing that, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that no matter what, like companies
like yours and mine and many other,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, I always sort of saw that
respect in a guy like Breeder Steve,
[SPEAKER_01]: who he was a real smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew what potency was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, he loved all the extracts and the
hashes, joints and bomb rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the guy covered the whole gamut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always respected that he was a Breeder
because I thought, well, he really knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have just smoked about five,
five or six grams of cannabis now since
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good day for Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good day for Bolloman.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room we're in is super smoky too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the air out already once too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hot boxing here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I'm almost done on this OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm halfway done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one's Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Boy from TGA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me one sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta find out the name of this LED
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LED light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll maybe grind up a little,
uh, a little Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is she empty?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo doesn't need her, but his grinder
after rolling a joint would highly doubt
[SPEAKER_01]: such a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be the ultimate person to test
the grinder, wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it through the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a lot of, uh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a lot of doobies here in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new name of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new name of the company is Spectrum
King.
[SPEAKER_01]: SpectrumKingLED.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check them out guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the light that Remo and I were both
talking about that we, uh, I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: bloomed with, but he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, these are the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got that nice Astro Boy smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me put a little of this in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to hit the Astro Boy grown by
Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've been growing a long time,
haven't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have you been growing,
uh, under the MMR program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 2001 or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, I was like patient number 70
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had this thing even before the
MMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a thing called a section six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they still have them actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the more potent of the two,
of the licenses actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Section 56, I believe allows for research
and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing research right here,
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My trippy stick pen is still, uh,
the herbal unit here is just going strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I blazed through four different kinds
so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to hit my fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unit's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit warm in the center here,
but otherwise pretty, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just excited to hit that Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, what I like to do is hit it as
it's just heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that low temperature vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those really, really volatile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, is that a nice ring in the smoke that
was, it was almost like a galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not stoned at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I find those low temperature, uh,
vape be very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can just taste that the terpene
has literally been like gently evaporated
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than like almost semi-combusted or
sublimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We photographed your plants with the macro
lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a couple videos inside the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a great video on these six
buds, which really, I hope that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: watch his video first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll save it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll even leave a link to go watch the
video of him showing with the camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo showing all the different buds and
explaining them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be the video you watch first and
then you can come back and watch this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a variety of videos today
that you'll have to watch in a hopscotch
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll have links the other way too,
to your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Urban Grower, Urban Grower is the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an Urban Ramo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urban Ramo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Ramo channel is now way bigger than
the Urban Grower channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably my Urban Grower channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of copyright infringements
and I got a lot of trouble on that
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were new at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just started another channel and did
the same thing and holy crap, I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: almost up to 90,000K.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw recently you were very close to
90,000K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Urban Ramo on YouTube for the
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some killer videos actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see Bubble Man in some of the
videos as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo was actually one of my big
inspirations on doing my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed me what camera to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just showed me a little bit of tips and
just from watching his videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to sort of be like,
all right, I can probably do a channel
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your channel's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of good information and if
you're a real hash connoisseur,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to be checking out Bubble Man's
world for sure or be part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that Astro Boy has a real
nice taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astro Boy, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally different high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up here in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first one that I felt really
strong in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really smooth too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost got a, you know, when you
inhale first, it's almost like a cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that could be your
dessert joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you're sitting down for
your three course meal, you might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: serving of headband and a serving of OG
with a side order of kosher kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then for dessert, you're going to
order up that Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it really is that C99 because
here the Apollo 13 and the Ortega are both
[SPEAKER_01]: very like strong, very much like these
three.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the C99 is that sativa dominant,
racy kind of fruity flavor that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be the salad course then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the salad course, of course,
would be the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweet skunk is so light and enjoyable
that people that don't even smoke pot can
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like if you dislike fish,
but someone says, oh, here, try this
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian candy, which is the maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we have to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even people that don't like salmon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll eat that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll eat that stuff and be like,
this isn't fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think of the sweet skunk as that very
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Indian candy of cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't enjoy pot, I've never
seen it produce an anxiety as high in
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women like this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women love this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife who barely ever, well,
she doesn't smoke at all anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she barely uses cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does use essential amino acids and she
produces her own endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she doesn't use cannabis in a smoking
or a recreational manner very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when she wants to relax, this is the
sweet skunk that she, I'm actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, I was going to say if I could grab one
little bud, not a big bud like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a little bud for the wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when Steve Cubby was around?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of his favorites too,
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that because if he was
able to smoke it, Steve smoked an unruly
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of cannabis, just an impressive
amount, much like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at least an ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember at one point it was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big long joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like two plus ounces a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of like, man, that's like,
that's too much smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he went and got his lungs tested
at this big facility down in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said his lungs were that of like
a young athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this was when he was 48 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty impressed that sort of
proof was in the pudding that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in my own mind, thinking that that
much smoke couldn't be bad, it still
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't bad for Steve Cubby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, Steve Cubby has a very rare
form of adrenal gland cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has tumors that are growing on his
adrenaline gland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pump adrenaline into his
bloodstream constantly, 24-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people that have this disease,
like a huge percentage most, they pass
[SPEAKER_01]: away at an early age from either a heart
attack or a stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because imagine having that acid running
through your veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just erode your, what's the word
I'm looking for, arteries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would erode your arteries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what ends up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strokes and heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Steve is one of the oldest surviving
victims of that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's even on some medical books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever get the chance to go skiing
with him?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went skiing with him a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had these really super long skis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started a ski magazine in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ski West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the 80s or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't doubt that Steve is a great
skier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Steve got me into skiing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ski for a decade because after my
accident, I figured I was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, oh no, there's people out
there with no legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crippled people with one leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go out there and do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senior citizens do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got me a set of skis,
solid scramblers for Christmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and made me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, just take it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before long, because I skied a lot when I
was young, me and Steve were ripping it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, I actually started skiing
with my son every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was he living back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun Peaks Resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was living at Sun Peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're ripping it up with your
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been skiing for 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's a video of him on 710
Riders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went skiing recently with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went down the mountain together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my helmet on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like skiing without a helmet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got a great video of my son doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 Riders on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally always ride with a helmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally paranormal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like one good smack on the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like you have to learn how to
walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like Sonny Bono.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smoked a tree pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a helmet and you hit a tree,
you could still die very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, Swan?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have one flavor left in our six
flavor platter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running the gauntlet today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're about halfway done your Astro Boy
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just break off a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little snap of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's your rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got that airy, airy sort of
wonderful sweet scum smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a huge fan, personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite sativas,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our dessert for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the dessert, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I better put in enough so you can roll
yourself the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're grinding that up, I should show
off this chunk of hash brown I found
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a Christmas present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ball of hash for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas hash we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your Christmas hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll break it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe at the end we'll try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-stop trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-stop rock here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can smell the lemony on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you really can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that I've learned recently
that there's a fair amount of terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that have that orangey sort of smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemony even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrusy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's myrcine and there's, myrcine not
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that's in mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's valencia or valencine,
soria, which is found in valencine
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, d-limonene,
which is very, I wouldn't say popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the one that you find a larger amount
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most common?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the most common one in standard
oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what Horatio is using in
his extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: In his extract he extracts limonene,
d-limonene from orange rinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Separates it out and then uses that
terpene as a solvent to strip resin off of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've tried some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had some of that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes his way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also doing dry sifting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's learned a couple of tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Johnny B came over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always got some of Horatio's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first person to introduce me to
Horatio, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good extract,
that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top shelf all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really conscious of what he's doing
and aware and wants to make sure things
[SPEAKER_01]: are done to the utmost of safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: His limonene extract was really a reply to
the butane culture that was the VHO guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that were all making a lot of butane oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He felt that it was fairly dangerous on a
multitude of levels, both for the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants that were potentially oil
soluble being trapped in the resin from
[SPEAKER_01]: the solvents and then put into the body,
but then of course the more simpler,
[SPEAKER_01]: completely unarguable explosions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids blowing themselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burning some fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, burning themselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was his sort of reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can produce something that still
allows them to dab, that's still an oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's still potent, but just doesn't use
this hydrocarbon to do the extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really cool of him to
come up with that and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he was the originator by any
means, but he definitely was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people here in British Columbia
doing it on a conscious level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it will inspire others to do the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a VHO thing where you just
go online and are like, oh, I can do this
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he's doing with d-limonene is serious
chemistry that you would really require.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even just having a conversation with him
about it, if you don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry, this can be somewhat over your
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found anyway because I'm no chemist
myself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk ripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've almost got the sweet skunk joint
rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cheers, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been an absolute pleasure hitting
this platter with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been ripper, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more joint to go for Remo as he sits
here and, I don't know, smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six joints, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six big joints, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's a two gram joint or a one
and a half gram joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some cannabis in there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to smoke cannabis,
you may as well smoke big joints of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The song is smoke two joints, not one
joint, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if it was your song, it might be
like ... Smoke six?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it might even be more ridiculous like,
smoke 112 joints in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke 112 joints in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a lot of dedication to rolling
joints and be stuck home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I saw your ashtray for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to fool me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that was yesterday's ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, this is Remo's ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Swan's going to bring it over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll embed it into the video so it shows
the nice backyard with the ... This is
[SPEAKER_01]: post noon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post noon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post noon roach collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get an intern surviving on ... Oh,
there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was about my fourth or fifth rip and
I just got the strong sweet skunk flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: come out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do some catching up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the salad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good vegetable matter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice one to finish it off with
having all these heavy, heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy cushions and then going into the
fruity astro boy and then the really light
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic sort of lemony sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No complaints there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's been quite the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I'll have somebody to help smoke
these joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I think it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling that people will be very
inspired to sit down and watch you smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: six joints like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My most popular video is, and this is once
again, you're like, oh, just my
[SPEAKER_01]: supercharged joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I did the pure hash joint video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The video has almost half a million views
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just from smoking one gram of hash,
but you just smoked like maybe about the
[SPEAKER_01]: same amount, one to one and a half grams
of hash in like six fat joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably, you know, eight to 12
grams of herb you just consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that eight to 12 grams of herb,
there's probably like one to two grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of hash, can we finish this thing
off maybe with one of those dabs like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the camera, can you see
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got pictures of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show that to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will get a nice dab prepped for
remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you have this brand new little
brush that you just happen to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you're a stoner when?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, dude, you just have
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, do you have any parchment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, you might have to only smoke on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the grand finale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get this six joints and a rip of
full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffing with you as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're going to wind it down,
maybe go have a tea or a little drink of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some water right here actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just puffed it tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need food.
[SPEAKER_01]: More cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure coming to visit
Remo, the urban grower, and stay tuned to

See you guys soon.
See you there.
