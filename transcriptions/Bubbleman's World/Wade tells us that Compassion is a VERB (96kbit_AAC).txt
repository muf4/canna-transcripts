[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanna throw this out there and
then I promise I'm gonna stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been thinking about what is
compassion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think compassion is a verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an action word.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can feel empathy for another person's
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we grow our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we grow our understanding of
who we are and where we are in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compassion comes into play when you do
something about the suffering of another
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, compassion is a verb.
