[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick little shot today,
a shout out actually, that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: give to TGA Genetics, Subcool and Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Subcool and Jill for 10 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill, even probably closer to the 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 year mark where I used to speak with
her on True Stoners back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went Toxic and Was Toe Guy and
Steppenwolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole crew we used to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the first kind of chats that
I'd ever been on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made friends and I stayed friends
with Jill throughout her breakup with Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: and through her getting together with Sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was one of the best
things that ever happened to her was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting together with Sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub and her have done great things in
their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community, if you watch their
Twitter feeds or their Instagram or
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook feeds, they're constantly feeding
the poor and giving away toys and things
[SPEAKER_00]: to kids with lack of opportunity or
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really just generally really good
people and basically recently they sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me this t-shirt which I was very
happy to see that it was at least 50% hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as organic cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sent me three sets of seeds
which I'm actually quite excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a 10 pack Subcool seeds,
the science of dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular strain is the Space
Bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, pretty excited to try out the
Space Bomb and read a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really too sure on the background
of a lot of these particular newer
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he sent me the Space Bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me the Time Wreck which I'm
actually really excited to try as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me the Jack Skellington which
is a Killer Queen cross with a JTR Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper I'm going to go out on a limb
and say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super excited about trying all three of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be cracking these in the next
couple of days, Sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you sent them out quite some time
ago but I only just received them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say thank you both to you
and Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an Astro Boy sitting right here
just for the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought when I do a video for Sub and
Jill, I really want to have that Astro Boy
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the background there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was also going to do a nice rip
because, well, that's what we do in this
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a 120 micron full melt
watermelon as I bang the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going into the D-Nail, hitting at
about 750 degrees into quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I for one am very excited to get
these seeds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep you all posted with macro
photographs and video updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be collecting specific phenos
in the female range but I'm also going to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect the males and save that pollen and
who knows what we will see one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's fun to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to play with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract those resin glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate them into microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment with how you use them,
whether you use them internally or
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaling through smoke or vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just such a great, wonderful
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the whole purpose of this video
today was just for me to tell everyone how
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful I am that I get to call Sub,
Cool and Jill my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful for what they offer to our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just really want to say thanks,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys fucking rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble on.
