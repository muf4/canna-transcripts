[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to welcome the people into
the room that came in, which was Remo and
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff and Ramon and Rick and is that
correct that maybe even the skunk man is
[SPEAKER_06]: off camera in the house at Hashchurch
episode 52?
[SPEAKER_10]: If I talk, do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, I hear you!
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome, guys!
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, welcome!
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, so can we ask Sam the origin of
Hayes, please?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hi Todd.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure you can ask me much that you
don't already know, but you can try.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a really good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell us a secret on how you make
such great dry sift?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, but you'll have to come out over to
my house so I can shoot you afterwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're doing well, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like you're keeping busy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am, brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Sam, let's for sure, could you for
sure talk a little about Skunk One and the
[SPEAKER_05]: impact, obviously, that it made on indoor
growing for us all?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some of us sitting in the room
obviously know the story but it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: really nice to hear you talk about Skunk
Number One.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what people want to hear,
but it was one of the first Indica sativa
[SPEAKER_10]: hybrids, but what was more unusual about
it was that it was fairly stabilized so
[SPEAKER_10]: that when you grew it and you made seeds
from it then you pretty much got what you
[SPEAKER_10]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of the other Indica sativa hybrids,
and there weren't a lot of them around
[SPEAKER_10]: back in the mid-70s once Skunk was
created.
[SPEAKER_10]: It helped change, but also a lot of people
complained that it was too stinky.
[SPEAKER_10]: What it was stinky from, of course,
was terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't win.
[SPEAKER_10]: The best stuff is stinky.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like the stinky.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was something you put together in
the mid-70s?
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk One really started in the mid-70s?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was started in the mid-70s,
correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was already available by, I think,
1978 at the latest Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: When was it introduced to the Dutch scene?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously there are no skunks
involved.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not until 1984, and then 1985,
seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, and it became a staple in the
breeding lines of almost everybody doing
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds as soon as you introduced it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was one of the easiest plants to
hybridize and get predictable results
[SPEAKER_10]: with, and often the hybrids were better
than either parent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, people liked it for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: When did you decide you didn't like that
dank, Afghani part of the Skunk?
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much from the beginning,
Aaron.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I had was I had hazes at the time,
which I loved.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really what I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I would smoke the Skunk, it was
strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It gave good blood structure, da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it also had that kind of high,
which is what I call kind of narcotic
[SPEAKER_10]: couch lock.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not really what I like.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I found out that the sweeter ones were
more turns I want.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for almost 10 years, I selected away
from the skunkier ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I brought it to the Netherlands and
did really large grow-outs of 20,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: What that allowed is selection of plants,
which were really super, the best of the
[SPEAKER_10]: best.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I selected 10 of those girls,
10 boys from those grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they grew out to the progeny and was
able to just determine which combined the
[SPEAKER_10]: best, produced the best progeny really
easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, easy after I selected another large
group of plants, thousands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, from all of us seed breeders who are
out here in the world, senior Sam the
[SPEAKER_09]: skunk man, thank you very much for your
contribution into making our industry what
[SPEAKER_09]: it is today, too, Rob.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really happy that I helped tip the
balance to what it is today, which is
[SPEAKER_10]: really unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_10]: The world governments have not admitted
that they've been defeated, but the truth
[SPEAKER_10]: of it is, of course, that the war on
cannabis is completely lost.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just punching it out a few places.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say ditto from the hash makers,
Mr. Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also appreciate all that you've
done to severely tip the scales.
[SPEAKER_06]: I give you props all the time and being
one of the people that 100% inspired me
[SPEAKER_06]: into water hash and into dry sift for
certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you never know what it would be like
without you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I appreciate that we don't have to
wonder.
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to the day when anybody who
wants to smoke a legal cannabis product
[SPEAKER_10]: can get dry sift that's 90 to even better
99.9% resonance of their favorite
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: That day is already reachable by a few of
us and will soon be reachable by anybody
[SPEAKER_10]: who wishes it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you please talk about the Strain
Haze and its origin?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorites as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Haze was really started by a friend of
mine up in the hills of Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_10]: A friend of Rob Clark's was also involved
in helping the guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: What it was was a combination of a punta
rojas, also a green columbian and a raw
[SPEAKER_10]: columbian.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those three were combined to create what
was called the original haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then some South Indian and Thai genetics
that I gave was added.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was not really the original haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the later haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would what you're describing as the later
haze be what some of us become known as
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that Neville was putting out,
the NL5 by haze?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if he got stuff that had Thai
and or South Indian genetics in it or if
[SPEAKER_10]: he got stuff that was just plain
columbian.
[SPEAKER_10]: The columbian expressed green,
lime, goldish, purple and the silver
[SPEAKER_10]: blues.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were all coming from just columbian
genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: After Philo checks genetic materials,
we might have some of these answers
[SPEAKER_10]: whether or not there's Thai or South
Indian genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many distinctly different varieties of
cannabis, Sam, do you think there are?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Traditional is what I would consider a
variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was hundreds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in South America, there might have
been a hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in India, there might have been a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: A few hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: What it really boils down to is most of
them have only THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the terpene plus the THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe a few other cannabinoids,
but those aren't really making it
[SPEAKER_10]: recreationally better, but they might be
useful for some other purposes.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people like medical varieties
with CBD in them, for example.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the terpenes in cannabis unique to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 140 terpenes identified in cannabis so
far are also found in all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_10]: plants, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that the 140 that have been
identified in cannabis so far might
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially be modifying THC in the other
cannabinoids, whereas other ones found
[SPEAKER_10]: other places that are not found in
cannabis are much less likely to be having
[SPEAKER_10]: anything to do with modifying
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, anybody else?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep being the one to ask questions,
but I could ask Sam questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're such a bullguard, Todd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd's bullguarding the Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a question for Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time and time again, I always go back to
thinking about how you were able to select
[SPEAKER_03]: and thinking about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it critical for anyone who really wants
to break ground in breeding to have that
[SPEAKER_03]: skill?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I think about selecting between
20,000, I'm like, when you smell it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you may be really, really far away from
base camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a gift that you have for being
able to do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just thinking about all the people who
fail and thinking about going through a
[SPEAKER_03]: field of 20,000 outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems insane unless you had an innate
gift for that ability.
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, I also did have a colleague,
Rob Clark, who helped me with a lot of my
[SPEAKER_10]: large field breeding or large scale
greenhouse breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob Clark helped me do the selection
processes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That right there cuts the numbers in half.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to evaluate cannabis,
I suggest you need to grow large plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have to be in the ground,
but it's easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were those numbers around 20,000 for you,
Sam, or were you planting more than that?
[SPEAKER_10]: 20,000 was the number that I was able to
grow at that moment at that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends on the variety and what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_10]: The larger the numbers you work with,
the better your results are going to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if tissue culture or
molecular biology is that important to
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis breeding at this moment,
but it is the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know how to do it,
you may need to have a team that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: working with that assists you in those
aspects that you aren't able to do
[SPEAKER_10]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you always travel during the known
harvest season so that when you went to
[SPEAKER_03]: India, you knew this is coming down,
so I'm going to be able to smell?
[SPEAKER_10]: We tried to, but it wasn't always
possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I had to pick it from dried
buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I had to get seeds from people
and not even see the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what I preferred.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in the air, carry it and that's
all you can get.
[SPEAKER_10]: Other times I had to use second parties
like Rob Clark connecting for me in
[SPEAKER_10]: Yunnan, China, or many other places,
since we've had a very long relationship.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that dry sift?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some sleet stack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it dry sift?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's actually some great water hash
sleet stack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you like it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it just as much as the day we were
smoking it sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Sam, we got dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite is usually dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would be all over this shit,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as it's not dank, I'm sure it'll
... Yeah, boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like Terp City right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I still have memories of that sleet
stack dry sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about to turn California out on
sleet stack here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I have to say when I first saw ...
Was it a sleet stack or was it a sleet
[SPEAKER_06]: stack skunk one cross that was the dry
sift?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was pure sleet stack, Aaron,
the first stuff you saw.
[SPEAKER_10]: My question to you, Aaron, is has any of
that sleet stack been analyzed for
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoid and terpene contact?
[SPEAKER_10]: That stuff really is unusual the way it's
so ... As long as you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_10]: it won't keep you up for long periods of
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's creative and energetic.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, the sleet stack is what really
brought us all together.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a friend in Amsterdam by the name
of Matt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in Alabama, I think, right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had some dry sift sleet stack and it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't even really cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have already met Sam the Skunk Man years
before this at our mutual friend Adam's
[SPEAKER_09]: birthday from TH Seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt's like, I got to show this dry sift
to Sam the Skunk Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he can clean it up and make it the
best.
[SPEAKER_09]: He takes this jar, this nice jar of sleet
stack, takes it over to him, and then we
[SPEAKER_09]: get a phone call.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, hey, you got to come over to
Sam's house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam's like, yeah, I really couldn't clean
it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: To a hash maker, that's like music to your
ears.
[SPEAKER_09]: When the legend can't do much to your
material, and it's just as good,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's like winning a cannabis cup for your
first time or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, you're recognized by a
legend.
[SPEAKER_09]: He fell in love with the strain,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even more impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we are, just a little experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You bred something and you did it,
and here's a little bit of first dry sift
[SPEAKER_09]: that came out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're sitting at a legend's house,
smoking your hard work at the legend's
[SPEAKER_09]: house.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a dream.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a dream come true.
[SPEAKER_09]: To have them like it so much and to have
them want to play with it and use it and
[SPEAKER_09]: grow it and do experiments with it is
truly an honor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure really fucking thankful that I
created sleet stack.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a little experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those little experiments turned out to be
something very special later on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for enjoying my work,
because I've enjoyed your work since I was
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: I absolutely enjoy smoking sleet stack dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob Clark might enjoy it slightly better
than me, because he's really a creative
[SPEAKER_10]: writing person, and that stuff he swears
is the greatest for creative writing,
[SPEAKER_10]: because it keeps you up all day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think it's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have the terpene and cannabinoid
profile?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything in there besides THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done anything with it yet,
but I can tell you this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be in the greenhouse,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just tell you that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get the whole expression
here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was always blown away that when that
sleet stack dry sift showed up,
[SPEAKER_06]: because I was also a big fan of it and I
was lucky enough to get to smoke a good
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had such a great high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could keep you up until four in the
morning, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really thought that it would be
something we just saw from that day on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was so special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it was all of a sudden that sleet
stack disappeared, and it was like BHO,
[SPEAKER_06]: BHO, BHO for the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see any killer amazing
off-the-chain dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd would have been happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's all over the BHO, but man,
I've missed the DNA.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry, Todd.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've missed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is amazing for certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a question for Ramon and Rick and
Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that freeze-dried hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is the fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I like it, and the effect,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, it seems like the THC level might
be a little bit less than some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: other ones, but I like the effect in a way
better.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish it was even stronger.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting tasting and
effecting.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I like about Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the different turkeys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not hard to find strong THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to find THC with the turkeys
that you like for a particular taste or
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: 837 people watching, and I've decided I'm
going to write a song called, I'm in love
[SPEAKER_06]: with the turpines.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll sing the chorus with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the main character in the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just singing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that we've reached the level of
understanding that we have, even if we
[SPEAKER_10]: just scratched the surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask, Sam, what were some of the
original strains that were being passed
[SPEAKER_05]: around in the 80s by the first seed
companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the first seed company?
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a great question to start
with, and what were some of the strains
[SPEAKER_05]: they offered?
[SPEAKER_10]: The first seed company, of course,
was Sacred Seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was 1976 in Santa Cruz, California.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know because I started it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were your original offerings?
[SPEAKER_10]: We had Hayes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Skunk, I think, was the next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we had Afghani No.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1, which I got from Jim Goodwin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Hindukush,
[SPEAKER_10]: South Indian Kerala, and Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of land races, and they were all
true breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my focus at the time for the
first few years I was in the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one are you talking about,
Horatio?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you asking about the unknown American
that showed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the unknown American question that
we always have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to ask Neville because Sam
can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, me and Rob saw Neville about,
I don't know, maybe five or ten days after
[SPEAKER_10]: the American who had been staying with
Neville for the weekend or something left.
[SPEAKER_10]: Neville showed us what the guy showed us,
showed him, which was grinding it up like
[SPEAKER_10]: in a coffee bean grinder type device,
and then putting water in it and stirring
[SPEAKER_10]: it again, and then letting it settle out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe under hypnosis I could.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: One day we'll hit up Neville.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll appear again.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll show up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was with me, but he doesn't remember
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you guys were smoking that amnesia
sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we weren't.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Neville mostly smoked cannabis with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one time I was all excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had met him before, actually,
but one time I ended up upstairs at
[SPEAKER_06]: Arian's apartment above the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard Marks was there, and Neville was
there, and I was with Breeder Steve,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was like, yeah, man, this is what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to talk to the old school dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they all literally accept Arian,
like Steve and Neville.
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard all rolled up a hash in tobacco,
and I literally was just like,
[SPEAKER_06]: aw.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one of those experiences where
you think, it's why I tell people don't
[SPEAKER_06]: get excited about meeting your favorite
band, because they probably won't be who
[SPEAKER_06]: you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could honestly say I've accidentally
taken one or two puffs of tobacco in my
[SPEAKER_10]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have loved to have seen the mean
mug, and you gave the guy who passed you a
[SPEAKER_06]: joint with tobacco in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: One time it was a Simsey, so it was a
Chinese Simsey, but you see, Keith in
[SPEAKER_10]: Morocco is hashish.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's marijuana flowers mixed with black
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's not really what we're
looking for, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't do the tobacco for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in India, where we're smoking
chillums on the side of the Ganges River,
[SPEAKER_06]: and everyone's like, no, no, you must put
tobacco in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you know, I must not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to smoke it with ganja instead of
tobacco, and hash, and then like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, an interesting note on the
terpenes ratio is someone in LA stopped me
[SPEAKER_05]: at an early cannabis industry meeting,
and he thought I was responsible for OG,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I directed him, but he had gotten a
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew it was for me back when I got out
of prison, pretty much, in 0405,
[SPEAKER_05]: 06, and he basically told me when he was
doing terpene tests that it was coming
[SPEAKER_05]: back with a very wide panel, and he
likened it to like a box of Crayola
[SPEAKER_05]: crayons.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, once you get your hands on a
box of 64 colors in the box, you never
[SPEAKER_05]: want to go back to eight, and what he
thought was is that even though the
[SPEAKER_05]: crayons weren't full, like there wasn't,
you know, complete terpenes profiles,
[SPEAKER_05]: like if you will, really rich ones of
each, he goes, there was a little of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything in OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, and what he thought the reason
why OG became so popular is because there
[SPEAKER_05]: was a terpene for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you look in a box of 64 colors,
almost everyone's going to find a color
[SPEAKER_05]: that they really like, but if they look in
a little box of eight, they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: meh, you know, and I thought that was an
interesting comparison for what it's
[SPEAKER_05]: worth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Todd.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question for Josh.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Sam, Josh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, okay, you got the clone
from some folks in Florida, I believe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they breed it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they just grow some seeds and find it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they get the clone from somebody else?
[SPEAKER_08]: The story as I know it is they got the
seed out of a bag that they purchased.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that the Grateful Dead thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a thing that comes from these two
guys in Orlando in around 92, 93 that are
[SPEAKER_08]: friends with Bubba, that are friends with,
I think, some of his buddies, and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: how it ended up in their hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were already breeding at this point,
and those seeds, I believe, that's where
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a couple other varieties that
they've come up with that even made it to
[SPEAKER_08]: Los Angeles, and I'm not sure where that
variety is now, but the original genetics
[SPEAKER_08]: is something to be found out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the reason I even came out and
started doing this is I have a long story
[SPEAKER_08]: in history with this, but there is a
history before it, and it's just super
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting to find out what that is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and maybe if we're lucky,
the phylos work might allow us to discover
[SPEAKER_10]: it, but there's no guarantee that we will,
because, for example, if you take an
[SPEAKER_10]: Afghan and a Colombian and a Mexican,
and then you breed it to itself on a
[SPEAKER_10]: population level for ten generations,
it's going to come out with a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: different ratios depending on what seeds
you're using at the end there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You understand what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some will be almost totally sativa,
some will have more Afghans, some will be
[SPEAKER_10]: more...
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's just no predicting what
ten self-generations will do.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone is interested in doing some
project with the cut that I have,
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm down for... Sure, send me an
email, Mark can tell you how, and what you
[SPEAKER_10]: can do also is... Where are you,
on the East Coast or the West Coast?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in Washington, up in the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so it's real easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can turn it into one of the labs in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll send it right to phylos for DNA
analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just really in land races,
but anything else is interesting also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam, are you able to maybe explain to the
audience as well what that is you're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about, because I don't think they
all know about the project, and we almost
[SPEAKER_10]: have 900 people listening right now,
so... Okay, I'll give it a real short
[SPEAKER_10]: rundown.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the greatest world speaker,
but here, basically what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_10]: we're extracting the DNA from either seeds
or leaves, which will allow us to conduct
[SPEAKER_10]: or create a family tree for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will show both relationships and
evolution.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might be able to say that everything
evolved from this variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: I doubt we will, but that's theoretically
possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we'll be able to say that this variety
is related to this variety and this
[SPEAKER_10]: variety, meaning that all the cannabis in
Africa originally came from India,
[SPEAKER_10]: or originally came from Asia, or it came
from... And the same thing, all the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis in Jamaica, it had to come from
someplace, Africa, India.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in a few years, we might be able to
answer most of these questions with DNA
[SPEAKER_10]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not trying to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not trying to make some sort of
living DNA library where the genetics
[SPEAKER_10]: could be stolen in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have interest in any of that kind of
GMO craft.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am interested in the relationships
and the evolution of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone had a question for Sam about the
Durban.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's asking if he came to South
Africa to collect the Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not only did I not go to South Africa.
[SPEAKER_10]: My daughter's been there, but I've never
been there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But where I got the seeds for South
African were from Jim Goodwin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he got them from Ed Rosenthal,
who got them from a coffee shop in
[SPEAKER_10]: Amsterdam called the Transke.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I grew them at my greenhouse in
Santa Cruz County, the plants that it gave
[SPEAKER_10]: were all hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to select out the one or two that
were the least hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was interesting dough.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I did was I selected out the few
that were the least, made seeds from
[SPEAKER_10]: those, grew those next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did that for about four,
maybe even five years, but at least four.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what I had was a variety that was
hardly hermaphrodite at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was my Durban plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Poison South African.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did get the seeds from somebody else,
but I did all the work to clean them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, at the time, it was the earliest
thing that people could grow in Canada,
[SPEAKER_10]: for example, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they appreciate the answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy from South Africa is giving you a
shout out saying that whether you know it
[SPEAKER_06]: or not, you changed the game down there.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing about South Africa is I've
grown several other South African
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties that were not as early as that
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one really is early.
[SPEAKER_10]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as long as it's good, that should
be the goal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything else is secondary to quality
for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, you've always pretty much from
I don't know if it's been from day one or
[SPEAKER_06]: not, but maybe you could answer this.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it became prevalent or when you
became aware that you would be breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: for hashish, not for cannabis to be rolled
into joints and smoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've done this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done it a bit, but nowhere near as
much as we'd like because some varieties
[SPEAKER_10]: like skunk and sleet stack also very much
so.
[SPEAKER_10]: When it's dried and cured a little bit,
the resin can be knocked off much,
[SPEAKER_10]: much easier than many varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some varieties like haze, it's difficult
to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the resin is stickier or
if the adhesion layer is different.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the exact mechanics are,
but in the future, also too, you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: want hashish that when you harvest it,
it falls off.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't want it when it's hanging
and drying, it falls off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a fine line between convenience
and stupidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I had another kind of good question I
just thought of in regards to whether you
[SPEAKER_06]: think that oil, whether it's butane oil or
propane oil, or ether oil, or alcohol oil,
[SPEAKER_06]: or even rosin, whether you consider those
to be hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then part B to that question would be,
what do you think about this rosin thing
[SPEAKER_06]: that's taking everyone by storm?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have zero against rosin, or rosin,
however it's pronounced.
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, it's hashish.
[SPEAKER_10]: No solvents are being used.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being heated, that's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in fact, that could have been done in
the 60s or 70s if you wrapped hash in
[SPEAKER_10]: cellophane and squeezed it hot and hard
enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd get a little bit of rosin,
but nobody was manufacturing it by the
[SPEAKER_10]: large amount, but now they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what makes its difference is solvents.
[SPEAKER_10]: And water's not a solvent, it's used as a
suspension agent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just like air for dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_10]: But a solvent, whether it be petroleum
ether, or butane, or propane, or ethyl
[SPEAKER_10]: alcohol, or whatever, even CO2,
that's fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying they can't make a totally
clean, safe product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying it's not really hash,
it's more in the direction of an oil or a
[SPEAKER_10]: glass turned out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to me, it's fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I understand that I'm arbitrarily
drawing a line in the sand, but luckily I
[SPEAKER_10]: have people like you that pretty much feel
the same way I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's about polyfloids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought I had one back in 1997.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a plant that when cannabis grows,
it pops two stems out and then grows a
[SPEAKER_05]: little higher and pops two stems out in
the opposite direction and does it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one went up, popped four stems
up, went up, popped four stems up,
[SPEAKER_05]: went up, popped four.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just posted a photo of it privately
in our little Facebook message thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll post it publicly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to ask Sam, what was the
plant I had, and then again, what is a
[SPEAKER_05]: polyfloid?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll explain it to you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you're mixing up is what's called
world phylotoxin.
[SPEAKER_10]: World phylotoxin means that the internodes
do what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Polyfloid, you can't tell if a plant is
polyfloid by physically looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you have to do is test the chromosome
to see whether it has two sets or three or
[SPEAKER_10]: four or whatever you think it is,
whether it's a triploid or tetraploid or
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, does it make a difference when
growing or breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're both, me and Todd, we're both
looking at this article where this guy's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on about different strains being
really tetraploid or diploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has so much theory that it becomes
way too much to read.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look in nature, all you find is
diploid.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe a few people have made
tetraploid varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a little bit of experiments with it,
but none of the varieties out there are
[SPEAKER_10]: tetraploid unless somebody's making one.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then they'd probably be advertising
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a guy up in Canada, what's his
name, Billy Budd?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly who we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big push.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, well, test it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Send a leaf to Phylos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to buy his clones, and they have
a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I strongly suspect that I have not
tested it, so I cannot say absolutely that
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ken, just to clarify, we had an echo
when you said it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the effect that the plant I had
or I saw I had with four stems instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: two at each intersection?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that's from a phenomenon called rural
phylotoxy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can read about it in Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rural phylotoxy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you think it had that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: My 20-year-old Jamaican seed came up with
that exact thing, producing the extra,
[SPEAKER_06]: the third instead of the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it can make two, four, three,
whatever, something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the sake of conversation,
how do you spell this wonderful new word
[SPEAKER_05]: to my vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, world.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how to spell world.
[SPEAKER_10]: W-H-O-R-L-E-D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Horl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Horl.
[SPEAKER_10]: And phylotoxy, P-H-Y-L-O-T-A-X-Y,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, I'm the world's worst speller.
[SPEAKER_10]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe T-O-X-Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that genetic subject, though,
I had a question for you.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look on the surface of a leaf,
and you look very closely, at the
[SPEAKER_01]: formation on a grid level of the trichome
heads that are forming, you actually see
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those strains tend to be really good
hash strains, for obvious reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're spread out with bigger
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes, in a very strange
variation or expression in the gene or
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you'll see that same surface area,
and the stalks fight for the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The surface area that's there,
creating almost like a chaotic expression
[SPEAKER_01]: of stalks trying to get in every little
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they produce heads as well,
maybe not as big, but it creates a very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to wash or extract type of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what kind of genetic expression would
that be linked to in this poly or tr-?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure it has anything to do with
polyploid.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's more likely it's just a
different variety of resin stem type,
[SPEAKER_10]: because there's so many different types.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you've seen it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are types of resin that,
quite literally, even after you've dried
[SPEAKER_10]: it for two weeks, you cannot touch it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just smear.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's other resin which is like
sleet stack, which after two weeks,
[SPEAKER_10]: or two weeks dry, it falls off like golden
sand.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't gotten to that level yet where
we understand the DNA and the genetics of
[SPEAKER_10]: this.
[SPEAKER_10]: But eventually, I'm sure people will.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only that, they'll use it to use DNA
assisted breeding so that they can screen
[SPEAKER_10]: thousands of little tiny seedlings and
only grow the plants that have what it is
[SPEAKER_10]: that they're after.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that is the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Dutch police put out scratch and sniff
cards so that informant neighborhood
[SPEAKER_10]: police type people could smell what
cannabis smelled like and call the police
[SPEAKER_10]: if they smelled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the cards smell like skunk number one?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, what strain do you think they like?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure it was candy kush,
so it's pretty much your fault.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, they got that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what variety it was,
but it was terpenes commonly found in drug
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they used.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a scratch and sniff.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also send out this little card and
say, hey, if you see this on your
[SPEAKER_09]: neighbor's building, and in the wintertime
it snows, but there's some rooftops that
[SPEAKER_09]: look like, yeah, for some reason the snow
has melted in the certain spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a little tiny portable battery
operated helicopter that flew around with
[SPEAKER_10]: a sensor that could sense terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they looked for cannabis terpenes from
the air, but only at suspected houses.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't do the general entire city.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would go to a place that was under
suspect.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they would sniff it and say,
yep, it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about taking a good idea and using it
for bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can tell you right now that
somebody's back of their phone or
[SPEAKER_01]: something got some of my, I'm trying to
think what terpene it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have been lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But went out of the country, didn't have
any cannabis on him at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had the presence of terpenes and had
another dog basically come at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog was across the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bolted right for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, whoa!
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just terpenes being on him.
[SPEAKER_10]: They train dogs internationally with
teriophiline.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe other ones also.
[SPEAKER_10]: But teriophiline they use to train.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we got so many growers in the room,
people ask me a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now people have used teas, like even
blueberry tea, to feed their plants during
[SPEAKER_03]: the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, how much do you find nutrients can
sway or carry over into the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it be a fish hydrolysate,
which has its own fish as terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or using flavored teas to impregnate the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how far does it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people used to different nutrients and
their taste?
[SPEAKER_07]: You could totally affect the taste of your
cannabis with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever tried turpinator?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we get this turpinator flavor?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else want to chime in?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what I find affects cannabis taste
the most is growing your plants
[SPEAKER_10]: organically to their full potential with
lots and lots of tiny roots and big
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that said, I'm sure that some
different organic foods must have slightly
[SPEAKER_10]: different.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not sure about feeding it molasses
to make it taste like molasses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or blueberry tea to make it taste like
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's going a bit far.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you ever use too much bat guano,
your weed gets a bat guano taste to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can overkill it with some of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nutrients totally play an effect of how
the antibiotics are going to taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was talking not in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I meant that as long as you can
organically grow great, great,
[SPEAKER_10]: fine, tiny roots, and lots of them,
then your cannabis is probably going to
[SPEAKER_10]: taste pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we ask you, Sam, what's your feeling
on flushing cannabis in the end of its
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle of flowering?
[SPEAKER_10]: I primarily grow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I grow them big, 10 feet tall,
three kilos plus, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't flush them.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I plow the ground in the springtime
before I plant, I use organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I time it so that it'll be pretty much
sucked dry by the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I plow it again next spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen, like when you've done
flushing experiments, do you find out what
[SPEAKER_03]: would be the difference in your case?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're going at it organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from the start, a lot of people will
say, well, then it should be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But does it affect the smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it affect the sift?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people depleting the plants of
something critical?
[SPEAKER_10]: I find that plants taste better when you
feed the soil so that the soil can feed
[SPEAKER_10]: the roots, feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you force feed the plants,
I think you can get higher yields.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think you get a better taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know anybody who force feeds
tomatoes to get a better tasting tomato
[SPEAKER_10]: than is grown from heirloom varieties of
tomatoes grown for taste organically.
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe it's more personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fertilizers definitely alter yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, that's the whole thing about
modern technology, was the advent of
[SPEAKER_07]: fertilizer to get higher yields with food
crops for farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the whole point of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, higher yields is important.
[SPEAKER_10]: But higher quality is more important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get some pretty good high quality
off of what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, what I do isn't entirely
organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a vegan program, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find giving my plants vegan stuff
actually gives it a nice clean flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get, look at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice ash at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free burning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tastes great.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it works for you, then I'm sure it must
be good.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, I don't smoke marijuana at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm strictly a resin smoker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not against dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry sift rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably smoke less herbal cannabis than
Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mark pretty much avoids it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't smoke it at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I tried to do less than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheers to you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheers to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not that I am against marijuana
for people that like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's their choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the main thing with me is,
to me, marijuana is strictly the
[SPEAKER_10]: messenger.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hashish is the message.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to smoke some SleeStack.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever you do get SleeStack analyzed for
both cannabinoid and terpene content,
[SPEAKER_10]: preferably the original mother,
not just from seeds from it, but the
[SPEAKER_10]: original mother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am really curious, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, I guess I got another question while
we've got another gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to indoors, because
obviously even though you have the lucky
[SPEAKER_03]: luxury of being able to perfect the
outdoor grow, when it comes to indoors,
[SPEAKER_03]: how far does light go in affecting
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen these crazy, you know when the
guy has 50, 25 watt fluorescent bulbs and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's wrapped the plant in it like a
maniac.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look and I'm like, he seems to be
getting a result.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how often do you see lights playing a
critical factor in directing the way the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics express themselves?
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I might be the wrong person
to ask.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've grown primarily outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in greenhouses with natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the right guy to answer about
lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have little crop experience with lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've maintained plants with artificial
lights for long periods of time at cold
[SPEAKER_10]: temperatures for suspended animation.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but you get, I assume everyone
brings you their bud to smell and then
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully convert to hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you basically get anything,
like your strains back and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: when do you basically go, this indoor
shit, there's a reason why you don't fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know it in your nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say indoor stuff that's grown
under lights, that I would like the clone
[SPEAKER_10]: of grown outdoors in the ground
organically, can be really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: The trouble is a lot of it's grown
chemically and it's force fed to try to
[SPEAKER_10]: maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're really interested in really
fast results rather than the highest of
[SPEAKER_10]: the highest of the highest quality like
you would want to make for your own
[SPEAKER_10]: grandmother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Horatio, people don't just bring Sam stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't usually work that way,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume you guys obviously get to assay
way more terp profiles than at least I
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of why I'm like, well if every
year in Amsterdam for your whole life is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best of the best being brought out,
you do eventually get a sense of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see OG over and over and over again
and then go, man nothing smells like 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it about that guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, it's not really true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one is, when people come and visit
me, as a rule I didn't make hash out of
[SPEAKER_10]: their weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: A few times maybe Aaron might have brought
some pretty clean resin which I either was
[SPEAKER_10]: able to clean up a little bit more or in a
few cases like he mentioned, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_10]: even clean it up more because it was so
good.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got cleverer and cleverer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if nobody else flushes in fruits and
harvesting, then what are we really
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about in a sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the plant doesn't have salts in
the buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: You better remember that when people
traditionally grew cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: hydroponically, they pumped it up to get
very fast growth.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would use carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would use all kinds of extra
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: They wanted to pump it up and get it
through wham bam thank you ma'am.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then in that situation, maybe you do
need to flush it at the end because you've
[SPEAKER_10]: had it on such a high level in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas organic, what you're doing is
you're feeding the soil and then the soil
[SPEAKER_10]: microorganisms are breaking down and the
roots are picking it up from there so it's
[SPEAKER_10]: indirectly and you're not forced feeding
them unless you've got incredibly high
[SPEAKER_10]: nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: But most organic farmers are aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's asking about Sam and if you've
ever heard of the black African was an old
[SPEAKER_06]: strain, heard some things of, would take
an old head to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as far as I know, black African was
because it was either compressed like corn
[SPEAKER_10]: cobs or buried under the ground.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it may or may not have been affected
by various microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_10]: It may or may not be still healthy for
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So true black African, there might also be
weed that's black too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen Colombian that's black.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen Vietnamese that was black.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen other satitas that were
almost black.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be either.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: You talking to us, Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was talking to these two amigos
sitting here next to me who were handing
[SPEAKER_10]: me various assorted rosins and I told them
I was going to smoke them all tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've always known some pretty cool
amigos, haven't you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how many years ago did you meet the
infamous Hayes brothers?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the original Hayes brother was doing
work up in the hills in the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_10]: I met them in 72, but one of them lived
across the street from me and one of them
[SPEAKER_10]: lived down the street from me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were both there because the first
Hayes brother did it alone for a couple of
[SPEAKER_10]: years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he was working with the other Hayes
brother who actually lived close to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: 72.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all the work was done by the first
Hayes brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was the second brother who were not
really brothers but just friends who added
[SPEAKER_10]: South Indian and Thai for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exotic flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a huge Hayes fan myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no secret that my son's middle name
is Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like super stoked on the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always made me happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like literally just the smell of that sort
of spicy exotic flavor that the Hayes
[SPEAKER_06]: often would give you in the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Hayes is hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm giddy that you came on, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Rick and Ramon, for bringing Sam
into the... You're very welcome,
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know that I love Hashtag Church and I
love what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kind of a shy guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, off camera, anytime you are welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate hearing from you and your
stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that this is going to be the
Hashtag Church that gets the most views
[SPEAKER_06]: and the most people talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big thanks to you coming in for
certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Josh and Bubba for
coming in and Todd for setting that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great to hear your guys' history.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great to hear your guys'
perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the way you share it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciated you coming on to Hashtag
Church and I'm sure we'll have you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: back on again one day as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pleasure having you both on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, thank Club Zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully Club Zero can do something on
the regular on Sundays and have a
[SPEAKER_06]: gathering with people coming in and make
them a little bit more of a part of what's
[SPEAKER_06]: going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it'll be regular old people who
haven't had a chance to speak on the panel
[SPEAKER_06]: to come up to the camera and say a few
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having you guys out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're trying to do something
weekly here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people here just kicking
it if you check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everybody, say hi to Hashtag Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're trying to get it on the big
screen next time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff posted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That right there is the inhalation station
of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio, always a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming on and sharing your
questions and your knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that are no longer with us,
we thank Dredd for coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony, as always, was kind of hilarious
today with his terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just absolutely ridiculous how
many flavors he dropped on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thank you for your unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Nurse Heather on with us earlier
and a whole variety of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank D420K for being with me today.
[SPEAKER_11]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pressing up the rosin, filling up dry
sift, bringing me glasses of water,
[SPEAKER_06]: a true friend, D420K, the dry sift
general.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam, you would love D420K's hash,
I can attest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone, thanks for coming out to Hashtag
Church 52.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope to see you guys next week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace, everybody.
