[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if our sound is improved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you let me know in the chat how the
sound is?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm going to send out the link to some
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so just copying and pasting the link.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now to the Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you sound good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can get everyone back in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so the sound is better now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we'll just wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: If everyone could just share.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if the link is updated since
I changed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, yeah, as we were saying,
thanks again last week for everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: watching and sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think getting our view count,
we're almost up to 8,000 on our women's
[SPEAKER_04]: episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I was just giving a shout
out again to some of the women who came
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hillary was co-hosting with me and Dr.
Marcia Gilman.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had Sarah Russo from Project CBD,
Wendy Turner, who's Colton Turner's mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been on a few episodes before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited her to come on today to join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see if she can pop on to say
hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had Andrea Herman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also invited her back again.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a lot of knowledge, especially
with just hemp and nutrition and even
[SPEAKER_04]: animal nutrition and different ways of
activating our endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just with the cannabis plant,
but with other herbs and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she always has a lot to contribute to
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had Rosie Mondin, who also owns
and CEO of Quadrant Extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we also had Nisha Whitley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Author of Chronic Relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: She also had a lot to contribute to the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: She had some interesting stories to share
about her mother who had lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a nice conversation came up about
using cannabis not only for medical
[SPEAKER_04]: purposes, but also for end of life
purposes and to help people die with
[SPEAKER_04]: dignity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what inspired Nisha to write
her book, which is the full title is
[SPEAKER_04]: Chronic Relief, A Guide to Cannabis for
the Terminally and Chronically Ill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And check out her book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't personally read the whole book,
but I've looked through the whole syllabus
[SPEAKER_04]: and overview of the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she does a really nice job of giving
an overview of the medical applications of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It breaks it down into really easy to use
and really to understand way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a book I suggested my parents check
out who are new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also recently suggested it to someone
who contacted me about more information
[SPEAKER_04]: about cannabis for cancer because she
includes a lot of recipes, simple ways to
[SPEAKER_04]: prepare cannabis, different ways to apply
it, including edible, topical,
[SPEAKER_04]: suppositories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's just a really nice
overview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Ethan Russo wrote the intro,
and he's the person who actually
[SPEAKER_04]: introduced me to Nisha.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out her book.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had Natasha Ray on.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was also a great addition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I like it because we have
similar names, Natasha Riz and Natasha
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's not to like about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had Amanda Sievert.
[SPEAKER_04]: The journalist for Georgia Straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she is their official cannabis
journalist here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was great to have on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also invited her back because,
I mean, it's always nice to have and also
[SPEAKER_04]: people to who are excited to cover what
we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we also had well, Dr. Michelle
Ross, PhD.
[SPEAKER_04]: She popped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read her bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, she had some tech
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll try to get her back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how are you, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me and you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's basically us just having a
date.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's so nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because after you sent me a
little, hey, nice, nice episode message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave and I were saying, hey, we need to
have a catch up with Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, didn't didn't expect it to
be live.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, greetings from one and only New York
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here seeing a bunch of fish shows
over the next wonderful days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few shout outs to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: People keep on coming up to me and like,
hey, Dr. Mark from Ash Church,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always like to see me out having
a good time with the folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just completely blissed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been following this?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, tell me more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're there with your family,
with the crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my wife and my daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just up for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Fish, the band Fish with the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that band usually plays like a summer
tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this summer out east here,
they decided to do a 13 show residency at
[SPEAKER_01]: Madison Square Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably most haloed rock venue in New
York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 13 shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're calling it the Baker's dozen,
which is kind of cool because I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: Baker's would always throw in the 13th
donut to make the so-called Baker's dozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, to cover their ass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make sure that they were getting
getting good products out to their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess even back to medieval times,
they talked about the Baker's dozen being
[SPEAKER_01]: a very, very important thing that enabled
loyalty to the throne somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each night they have a different
flavored donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first night opening night that
the flavored donut was coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they covered the Schmielson tune,
put the lime in the coconut and drink it
[SPEAKER_01]: all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every coconut theme song,
they try to fill their whole set with
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut theme songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night, it was strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strawberry donuts was the theme last
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got what was that name that tune
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry Letter 23, Strawberry Letter 23
and Strawberry Fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They opened up with the Beatles Strawberry
Fields playing at acapella.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about the no hash content here,
but just telling you like what we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: here in New York and it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each night there's a new donut and
what they do the band just as a creative
[SPEAKER_01]: vortex has been taking the theme of that
donut and putting it back into the set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for tight, the donut is a red velvet
donut with cream cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of speculation that
there'll be some velvet underground covers
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the velvet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish has got a song called Waiting in the
Velvet Sea, so we'll certainly hear a
[SPEAKER_01]: velvet sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each night is a different donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're thinking like the Boston
cream donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll play some Boston covers,
you know, or maybe for the powdered donut
[SPEAKER_01]: they would do, God knows, you know,
Neil Young powder finger or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each theme, each night is a different
theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives us something to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they give donuts away too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And donuts are notably the most wonderful
food that Canada has brought to the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your on your end?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a little bit of an echo,
but that's just cause Sam I think is not
[SPEAKER_11]: muting his mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got everyone muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And did we get Brian from VITAL invited?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got him the email.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says he hasn't received it either as
Dragonfly Medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll send it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'll try sending it one more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: One moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the floor and I'll resend them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, tell us what you're up to and
I'll work on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we are here in Montego Bay,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had our products registered with the
Minister of Health recently here in
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaica, the Prana CBD products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so today we are training the doctors
and the pharmacists who will be
[SPEAKER_11]: prescribing this medicine in the upcoming
months here in the Caribbean and Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are a lot of, they're obviously
educated doctors, but they don't have a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of education in the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have a lot of education when it
comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you talk to the majority of them,
they seem to be a lot from the sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: NIDA standpoint, you know, the majority of
things I think they've seen over the years
[SPEAKER_11]: have been negative, you know, a lot of
them believe that cannabis is addictive,
[SPEAKER_11]: that if you smoke cannabis in the morning,
you're addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sort of, there's, there's a little bit
of that sort of NIDA mentality,
[SPEAKER_11]: but at the same time, when you talk to
them, they're very receptive and open to
[SPEAKER_11]: education, to proper information and
they're, they're intelligent people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's going to be a pretty
exciting day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony has built an absolutely stunning
deck.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about 65 pages long, going through
the entire mission of our company from
[SPEAKER_11]: John Berfellows patient story.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy right here, yeah, that's the guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: To the processing history of our company,
to the history of, of even the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the, the master breeder himself,
you know, everyone's represented.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to build a pretty cool little
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're just getting that much closer to
making Jamaica a reality where our company
[SPEAKER_11]: can be here and actually be, be producing,
be producing wealth for the country and
[SPEAKER_11]: for the company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, welcome Brian from VITAL.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry it took me a minute to click in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always technical issues here with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what, when I'm in Jamaica,
it's always technical information.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm literally sitting above four
blenders right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, look at these guys are like blending
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a blend party over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to set up the dab bar for real.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope my background noise isn't too loud.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to keep my mic muted as often as
possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, same here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I changed headphones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully these ones don't have the
feedback like last time.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you sound good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't, but that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a rhyme when I was speaking when
Natasha opened up the first church.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to start over again by
absolutely thanking all the women who came
[SPEAKER_11]: into hash church last week and just
crushed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned a lot from watching the ladies
interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always felt like any type of pause is
like not good and we shouldn't have them.
[SPEAKER_11]: But after watching the ladies and having,
they will talk and then they would all
[SPEAKER_11]: stop and there'd be like, I just thought
it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was something that we could
learn from that particular experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved the information that the women
shared.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved how they consistently kept the
panel full for the entire show.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really impressive and just great
job organizing and moderating Natasha as
[SPEAKER_11]: well as Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys both did a stand up bang up job
and everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, I can't even name them all,
but it really was an impressive church and
[SPEAKER_11]: we're definitely going to get more of
those women back.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll try to do some more all women
panels because I think it's just good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's unique.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not into segregating.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not into, you know, keeping certain
people out, but I think that the woman
[SPEAKER_11]: panel, the all women panel really,
it impressed me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, it was fun to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said on, on Facebook,
like thank you for trusting me to take
[SPEAKER_04]: over and thanks for, I mean, we put that
together in a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very even a last minute show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I threw it out to all my contacts
and yeah, for anyone who feels like they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't included, please, like we're going
to do this again.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was just a last minute show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last minute thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even really, I was overwhelmed with all
the women that could take part and yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, it's not about the women taking over
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about as Marcus said, us,
us joining you guys, us let's,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's do this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've even invited some more of the women
from last week to come join us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, let's just have conversations
about cannabis and I'll learn together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the conversations I was very
impressed, which Hilary opened up with,
[SPEAKER_11]: which was the sex and cannabis talk,
you know, it almost as though the men are
[SPEAKER_11]: too immature.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a conversation we've never even
breached because you can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even when we talk about
suppositories, it turns into ask church.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't help it, but it was nice and
refreshing to hear the women talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: the topic sex and cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just, I give you guys all thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a really, really nice conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a nice show.
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of our wives enjoy that email
and all around the world just saying about
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So apologies for taking 146 episodes to
make it happen, but we made it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to be able to hang out
probably only for another half an hour to
[SPEAKER_11]: an hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to go do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe we could get to get a little
bit more information from Brian.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people have been really enjoying
the greenhouse talks, the growing talks
[SPEAKER_11]: and what's going on in my garden supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in the epicenter of cannabis
growing in the entire world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I doubt that there's a larger cannabis
community, larger cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_11]: anywhere than in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Sam knows somewhere that I don't
know, but wouldn't you say California is
[SPEAKER_11]: the market, Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what about Morocco, Lebanon,
Afghanistan?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just seems like California just has that
purchasing power of buying a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how much of that hash ends up
down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, how about we start by giving a
wonderful happy birthday to his imperial
[SPEAKER_11]: majesty, the conquering lion of Judah,
Emperor Haile Selassie, born on July 23rd.
[SPEAKER_11]: God, what was it?
[SPEAKER_11]: 1868 or something?
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a long time ago for sure,
but props to all my Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Ja Rastafari Selassie and props to
all my Rastafari that use him as a guiding
[SPEAKER_11]: light in their lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are down in Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you able to hear me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I can hear you perfect,
Brian.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jamaica, you guys are having fun?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a good time in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went and visited a field the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went and visited a processing facility
and a packaging plant that will
[SPEAKER_11]: potentially be able to package up
medicines.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got this doctor conference,
which is going to be a big one and just
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of going forward from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as they say in Jamaica,
forward ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Backward never.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we're going for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, welcome Joshua.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey family.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on, Joshua?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi Kelly.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, how you doing, Brian?
[SPEAKER_11]: You from Dragonfly Medicine?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragonfly Medicine in the house?
[SPEAKER_09]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Representing.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little choppy, kind of can't hear you,
but I'm sure technical difficulties fixed
[SPEAKER_11]: here soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're kind of breaking up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just reading the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, I just want to let everyone
know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably hear you a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me, Natasha?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're not coming through.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't hear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can hear you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, where's Etienne?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's notoriously absent here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Etienne is traveling today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: John's wonderful headphones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you there, Natasha?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I can't hear anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry guys, I'm going to blouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, hopefully you can make it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that, he's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Natasha.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hosting for Marcus today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if we're all speaking, I'll just be
muting people's mics if we're all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't, just so you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then unmute and pop back in when you're
ready to talk so we don't get sound
[SPEAKER_04]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want, please tell us a little bit
about what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, who just jumped in?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you had a chance to say
anything yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joshua.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joshua and Kelly, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, is your sound working okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear us now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can hear you guys great.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelly and we're from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine and we own a inoculant company in
[SPEAKER_02]: both Canada and the US and also Europe,
but primarily we're 27 years cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers up here in BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just done a lot of education with
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And living off the land closed loop
systems, really learning how to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis without anything, without any
help other than other nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how that raises cannabinoid levels and
terpian levels so often, so often.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Canada, do you grow outdoors under
lights in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your setup?
[SPEAKER_09]: Primarily in interesting greenhouses and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've been growing in greenhouses for
25 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we used to do guerrilla grows way out
in the bush and we started growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses once I got our medical license
about seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've grown every way in the last
27 years kind of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: for 27 years, like the first garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we jumped out into big
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but yeah, so over the course of
time, we've lived on this land for 11
[SPEAKER_09]: years and made an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us more about the inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inoculants are basically made out of
different herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am a healthcare provider.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with women and children in the
third world as well as I'm a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a midwife as well as I have a
background in naturopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always gone to disaster relief
zones to help women and children out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like after Haiti, after the tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we utilize what's around the area to
help bring nutrition to the women and
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times when there's a cutoff or
you can't get supplies that you need in
[SPEAKER_02]: zones and areas, which is a lot like what
we're in in BC, we utilize the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs to get vitamins, minerals,
our trace minerals to help boost the
[SPEAKER_02]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our entire herbal inoculant is based
off of health and wellbeing for women
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pregnancy tea blend actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add different fungi and
bacteria to it, make a brew, voila.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happens to be amazing for cannabis
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And over the course of the years,
by working with women and pregnant women
[SPEAKER_09]: along with plants and herbalism and
mycology, you can see the placenta change.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the women change.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the health of the baby change.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're working with malnutrition,
human beings that live a third world life
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're giving them simple vitamins or
even just telling them to drink the
[SPEAKER_09]: moringa tree more or eat the tapioca
greens more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see how the placenta changes
and all of the vital signs change and
[SPEAKER_09]: everything's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're growing herbs and plants
the whole time to create the medicine for
[SPEAKER_09]: the women.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're starting to treat the
plants like the women.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we started realizing the beauty
of using plant medicine on plants and then
[SPEAKER_09]: watching the health of the plants change
due to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we lived far away in the
mountains up here, so it was a bit of a
[SPEAKER_09]: necessity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we just dropped out of society
essentially for a really long time and
[SPEAKER_09]: just did our work and did that work across
the world and here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we started our dragonfly earth
medicine 10 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So 10 years ago we made our first product,
which was Lush Roots, our mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_09]: inoculant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Based off Southern Oregon and the
monumental growing that happens down there
[SPEAKER_09]: and the mythical amazing families that
have been doing it forever, along with
[SPEAKER_09]: Northern California, the mycotes back in
the day were a big thing that jumped plant
[SPEAKER_09]: health a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we started on that level and then
started working with herbs and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been a long process, lots of
different steps, and to try and define
[SPEAKER_02]: health for soil primarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just so happened that it mimicked
health for women and children as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned you also put some other
herbs that were good for the immune
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in the immune system,
so can you tell me a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well for our vegetating plants,
that didn't work, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: For our vegetating plants, we do nettles,
horsetail, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We utilize wild yam because it's also a
natural stimulant for hormones as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, we've got burdock root in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with a wild turkey rhubarb root.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Comfrey, spirulina, raw cacao.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all sort of interblended in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add the bacteria, then you add it into
a brew or as a top dress into a soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then immediately the microbiology
starts to break down those herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, so it makes it readily
available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you choose your microbes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you choose microbes to be broad
spectrum, or did you choose some specifics
[SPEAKER_04]: for specific purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: We primarily chose them because they are
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The basis of our product is all definitely
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go all the way down the lines to try to
find out exactly where our herbs come
[SPEAKER_02]: from, whether it's wild crafted or we go
to the farm itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's human grade organic, not for use
in agriculture organic, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_09]: into later, being a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use a five different bacteria blend
that is grown off of non-GMO substrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's really the only organic one
that we can find in the industry that's
[SPEAKER_02]: readily available and that we know where
it comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the opportunity for a great
educational moment, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the plant relies on a healthy
microbial population to help fix nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: because nitrogen fixations have a very
high energy process, and bacteria have
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit figured out, man, for eons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't reinvent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything that kind of came after
on the food chain came based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria's ability to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're talking about is atomic
nitrogen, which is inert, an inert gas
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 79% of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it gets fixed, it gets put into
soluble form and a nitrogen molecule gets
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into an amine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amine are like the amino acids,
which are absolutely essential building
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks for proteins for all living
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, if you try to fight
bacteria, I mean, I'm not saying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, the guy who doesn't wash his hands
after using the lavatory or doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: good sanitary hygiene practices,
bacteria, there's a whole host of good
[SPEAKER_01]: ones and bad ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have to use this as an
educational moment to let people know that
[SPEAKER_01]: not all bacteria is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bacteria is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, you can't just use broad
spectrum antimicrobial biocides because it
[SPEAKER_01]: wipes out some of these lower rungs in the
food chain ladder that the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ladder relies on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you knock out the ability for
microbes to do nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to rely on nitrogen input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're talking about fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think what you're doing is
really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have to figure out a way
that we can use Mother Nature's chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: set, which has had the time course of
evolution to sort of unfold and reveal
[SPEAKER_01]: itself to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually what we're big on at VITAL
is combining microbes and NPK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, only organic forms of NPK.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're big on using compost teas and
microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game of pH, but it's also a game
of, you know, there's a whole host of
[SPEAKER_01]: things going on in there, some of which
I'm probably sure we still don't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we take lessons from Mother
Nature because she's had her chemistry set
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot longer than we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no scientist, but I have a lot of
experience growing and farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't know it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not accredited.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And definitely the microbes make the NPK
available to the plant so it can actually
[SPEAKER_08]: grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these people pounding their plants
with salts and feeding, feeding,
[SPEAKER_08]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant can only take so much,
especially if there's not a microbe to
[SPEAKER_08]: break it down and in salt form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and again, this is like we were
talking about this a couple of weeks ago
[SPEAKER_01]: about having roots in the ground,
you know, as opposed to roots in a kiddie
[SPEAKER_01]: pool or a tire or some flower pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when roots are in the ground,
you're now tapping into Mother Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: herself, which has a whole different biome
than recreated soil or hydroponics or
[SPEAKER_01]: rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a whole different game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of actors that are
involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: And because of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to like train themselves,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually seeing people like go from
container growing into ground or bed
[SPEAKER_08]: growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're realizing that they don't
have to water as much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like the food's in the soil and then
the microbes and the carbon and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mother Nature's breaking it all down
and making it available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has evolved underneath this
light spectrum for eons.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, we're just being disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_09]: To our own evolution.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just trying to be better than Mother
Nature at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we're all
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could take from Mother Nature what we
can learn and share it in venues like this
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can get people thinking at a higher
level of, you know, knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you talk about putting
plants in pots or, you know, in kiddie
[SPEAKER_02]: pools and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're really starting to realize
through observation is that cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: social plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to be planted next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to speak to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to share what's going on with
one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only in their upper leaf and canopy
section, but also in their roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this idea of separating root zones just
isn't really good for the health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is it not good for the soil,
the microbial breakdown, but it's not good
[SPEAKER_02]: for the plants as well as their uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing a tremendous amount of
research on CBG because it's the one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're really looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, CBG is that amazing catalyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot in our genetics here,
we find that CBG is going up higher with
[SPEAKER_02]: the same genetics, the same soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're planting the two plants next
to each other, we're realizing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where the roots can intermingle
and the roots can have communication that
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBG levels along with all the other
cannabinoids are going up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we do know for a fact that trees
communicate within different species.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like out of their own species,
they can get, a pine tree can get sugars
[SPEAKER_09]: from a birch tree or, you know,
I can come up with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_09]: trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why wouldn't a cannabis farm continue
communicating with all of the flowers and
[SPEAKER_09]: trees around it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's a beautiful
thing at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called quorum sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quorum sensing and chemical ecology is the
way by which bacteria sort of communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a language of chemistry,
which makes me really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microisol also is a good way for plants to
communicate through one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go back to a point you brought
up about high CBG strains or you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalence in high CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dial Sam into this discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sam, that basically means that they
have a down-regulated synthase that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: able to process the CBG into its
productive end use product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe more productive end use
products, THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if there's a mutant or a
variety somewhere that we could identify
[SPEAKER_01]: based on a loss of synthase expression
genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that says is that you're
backing up the cannabinoid pathway after
[SPEAKER_01]: that first crucial carbon-carbon bond
formation between allotelic acid and when
[SPEAKER_01]: it first gets preenlated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the formation of CBGA,
which happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a sort of the stem,
what they call the stem cell cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is funny, but why wouldn't
those, so are there mutations in those
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties where we can actually examine
why the synthase is not sort of keeping up
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce CBD and THC from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've now, there's technology
where they can actually do the CBG in
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast, which is scientifically an
extraordinarily achievement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you'd want to make CBD or
CBG in yeast, but maybe again,
[SPEAKER_01]: when cannabinoids get more accepted as
just mainstay vitamins and nutrients for
[SPEAKER_01]: the human diet, they'll be making CBG in
yeast, which can then go into a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: food and perhaps other products for human
consumption just to start to get CBG in
[SPEAKER_01]: the diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just want to get Sam's input
on the synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would those synthases sort of not,
I mean, could we look for like the same
[SPEAKER_01]: type of mutant that you see in SCUNK-1,
which has a dysfunctional CBD synthase?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I missed the other part of it because
I was in the other room looking up a
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria, which is prohibited from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I didn't hear the beginning part of
your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were just talking about high CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, growing it from yeast does not make
any economic sense when you can develop
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties which yield 10% by dry weight
and yeast yields less than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are not really doing it yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the whole point of cannabinoids
that they work together, what's the
[SPEAKER_09]: purpose of isolating one of the
cannabinoids without its whole family near
[SPEAKER_09]: it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can tell you one really positive
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you smoke THC with the right
terpenes, what other cannabinoids do you
[SPEAKER_06]: actually need?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get recreationally high
from cannabis, you want THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want any other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been THCV, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more interested in a little THCV mixed
with my THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you smoke CBD with THC, it delays
onset, reduces peak experience,
[SPEAKER_06]: and makes it last longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But who wants something to last longer
that's not as good?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, who says it's not as good?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it have to be potent to be good?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm pretty good at judging this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, when people say full
spectrum of cannabinoids, not for
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational use, maybe for some medical
use, but for recreational use,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational is medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's what you think, but it's
certainly not what I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the whole entire reason that we're
sitting here right now with the ability to
[SPEAKER_09]: talk out in the open is because of
medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the beauty of the cannabinoids in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why does it change when it's
recreational?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's making you feel good, why isn't
that medical?
[SPEAKER_02]: If all of a sudden I'm having a really
shitty day, I'm smoking a doobie because
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to think better thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't that medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're agonizing your CB1 receptors,
which is the most prevalent receptor in
[SPEAKER_01]: the human brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not a happy accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why we feel so good when
we enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fitting in the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just dumped a lot of keys and we
have a lot of locks.
[SPEAKER_06]: By any chance, have you guys, for
recreational purposes only, forget medical
[SPEAKER_06]: just for the moment?
[SPEAKER_06]: And for recreational purposes only,
have you ever smoked a pure THC and then
[SPEAKER_06]: added one by one the other cannabinoids
and seen what the difference is?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make THC better.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear the last part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never done what you had asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making these broad statements as
though you really understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure if we're necessarily
making broad statements as much as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just really trying to say that we feel
that recreational is medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to stick with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if it makes you feel good and
you're going to go about your day and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make you a better person because
you feel good, then I consider that
[SPEAKER_02]: medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that there's not one
recreational user out there that derives
[SPEAKER_06]: no medical benefit from it or is seeking
any medical benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not one in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where we're going right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess I'm a little confused where
we're headed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's just trying to say that for
recreational purposes what you need is THC
[SPEAKER_06]: and the correct terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't require the other cannabinoids
for recreational end use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's your perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's agree to disagree on that point
because I think you guys are coming at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with what Sam's saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some people who are consuming
cannabis purely for, as he's referring to,
[SPEAKER_04]: rec purposes, i.e.
[SPEAKER_04]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also agree that feeling good,
having that mood elevation, even that
[SPEAKER_01]: escape from... CB1 and agonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 agonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't stop it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I mean that to me I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that that is medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I don't think we need to
separate the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I get what you're saying that there
are purely...
[SPEAKER_04]: You could say it's recreational if
someone's just taking it with that
[SPEAKER_04]: intention in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: But why doesn't that also have a
medical... Okay, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: People drink alcohol and it makes them
feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that medical use of alcohol?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there can be medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't ever drink alcohol because I
consider it... Yeah, it's just not for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the beautiful thing about humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low amounts of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: But low amounts of alcohol are a very
potent anxiolytic and help reduce anxiety
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very effectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you don't consume alcohol that
often and you use a small amount,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can be very effective for reducing
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely can have medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you're talking about is when
people are consuming alcohol every day,
[SPEAKER_04]: often, of course it can have bad issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and cannabis consumed daily for
stress relaxation to help with anxiety
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't going to have the same additive
problems that something like alcohol can
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas alcohol once in a while can be
okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I absolutely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is not a toxic poison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alcohol is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can't deny that low doses of
alcohol do have medical applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, even alcohol topically,
alcohol for other things, it is a medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: also.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is a poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all in the dose, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the healing of the nation,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I'm always going to say people
should choose cannabis to relax over
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol because it's safer over the long
term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use alcohol even either,
but it takes all colors of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of different choices out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are making all different kinds
of choices when they go to light up that
[SPEAKER_02]: joint as to the reason why they're
lighting up that joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be that they've had a hard day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may also be just because they want to
get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's really hard to
separate it across the board, which each
[SPEAKER_02]: individual is utilizing it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mass produce swill from multibillion
dollar corporations looking to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis prohibited aren't the type of
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like my micro brew or I like a
single malt scotch or glass of wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally within reason to think that,
again, humans could have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Sam, we love your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, again, we all know that the
reason why we feel so good is because
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a biological action in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it you know, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also adding to the fact that
we're putting a lot of fat soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidants into our Oedipus tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's slowly released over time,
which gives a very prophylactic effect
[SPEAKER_01]: over reactive oxygen species, which often
form free radicals that can start causing
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations like cancer and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that you're basically
ingesting cannabinoids, which have an
[SPEAKER_01]: endogenous system within our body,
to regulate, I mean, think about it this
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body's pharmaceutical company is the
endocannabinoid system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of it is through health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this on church health
and also use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortifying those, you know,
immune systems that, again, have evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: over the time course of evolution in
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who are we to second guess it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals want to, you know,
give you a pill and yeah, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mentality is, oh, if I'm sick,
there's a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just take a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, I think cannabis
provides a different option to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether you think you're doing it
recreationally, well, yeah, I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationally right now because I'm in
New York and I'm hanging with my bros and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all recreational doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the fish show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to throw down and we're just,
we're all recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beautiful thing is while we're
being recreational, the molecules going
[SPEAKER_01]: into our bodies are protecting us from
cancer, are helping our bodies regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the immune system in the way our humans
were designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this all has to do with,
again, your own perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from San's perspective, hey,
humans are doing this recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to achieve something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether you're achieving that for that
reason or not, like it or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: your body is being flooded with molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are probably going to save you from
things like glioblastoma tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a friend pass away from
glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the aggressive form of brain cancer
that they just announced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think who's at John McCain, one of the
US senators anyway, came down with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, is that our prolonged
cannabis use has basically put CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: other antioxidants which are very,
very important molecules to regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do believe that a prolonged
cannabis use basically helps protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain over your lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your brain is an extremely important
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like your hard drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a brain, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically putting medicine in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're doing it for
recreational purposes, like I am in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York City having a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all recreational to doubt,
but I'm basically feeding my
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system with these very
beneficial molecules that will help me
[SPEAKER_01]: stay alive longer and be a little happier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most of us found cannabis in a
recreational form originally because most
[SPEAKER_08]: of us that have been around it so long,
it was prior to any sort of medical
[SPEAKER_08]: research or any of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's sort of a blessing that we fell
into the whole cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it cool that we know what we know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing like back in, you know,
pre any of these discussions before when
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone was still hiding behind closed
doors, you know, we were experimenting
[SPEAKER_08]: with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have this like platform to like
really expand and help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it that we're just rediscovering
what we already knew, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really interesting because I'm
really interested in autoimmune disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I've been interested
in for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm starting to do a lot of research
on MTHFR and realizing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: over half the population of Euro descent
have this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along with this particular type of
mutation, which a lot of us have and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even realize that we have if we're
producing things in our body that produce
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of toxins that come
along with stress that actually can turn
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular mutation that a tremendous
amount of people on the planet have right
[SPEAKER_02]: now can turn it right immediately into an
autoimmune disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of smoking cannabis or
utilizing cannabis can actually bring all
[SPEAKER_02]: of our levels down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings our cortisol levels down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings down all of the hormones in our
body, which actually help us have a
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger autoimmune system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Without it, I don't think I'd be able to
do what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm trying to do is point out that if
your main goal is getting high,
[SPEAKER_06]: then what you want is THC in the right
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of the other terpenes contribute to
making you higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD can delay onset, reduce peak
experience, make it last longer if that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's certainly not what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even going back to that feeling high
and even like when you're with your
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, when you're having fun,
when you're feeling connected,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're out of your ego mind,
when you're in the moment, when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: calm, all those things help relieve
stress, anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if you're going on a psychedelic
journey, that is still in my mind
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal because it's bringing you just
different knowledge, different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's separating you from your daily
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's giving you something different to
think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's giving you a change in perspective,
which I think is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think more people smoke CBD with
THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them say it's for medical
reasons, but a lot of them say that pure
[SPEAKER_06]: THC by itself when they smoke it gets them
high, paranoid, and they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's mixed with CBD, by reducing the
peak experience, by delaying the onset,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, they're able to handle it enjoyably.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want it for recreational
purposes, the majority of the people I
[SPEAKER_06]: know that are really into it, they don't
want no CBD with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I'm a big fan of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think THC has huge medical applications
also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think THC is just for rec
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are getting the CBD as a
bonus and they don't even realize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand that some people feel
it's a bonus, but you need to understand
[SPEAKER_06]: that some feel it's absolutely negative to
the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just saying all colors of the
rainbow because the truth of the matter
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is that we're growing a one-to-one
here and it's about a 12%, 12% CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I can't smoke it unless it's
time for bed because the CBD mixed with
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC in my particular body chemistry
makes me way more high than if I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: a 27% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really individual in how it is
that you're feeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need to be respectful to the
concoction of a hundred other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_09]: that are available in there and how it's
coming together.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a hundred other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there might be close to a hundred
that they've discovered in the last,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there was 70 or 80 for the longest
time, but they keep finding ones,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you can't help but wonder,
are they truly produced by the plant or is
[SPEAKER_06]: it a result of analysis?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a really good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it medicine when we don't know about
it?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it take science to bring light to us
so that we can actually understand it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that in our bodies, we're feeling
all these different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to say that you're smoking just THC or
just CBD is rarely ever the case unless
[SPEAKER_09]: it's an isolate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always going to be different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, after looking at reports in THC and
CBD levels of cannabis that I've been
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking for many years that I'm like
sometimes surprised to find that there's
[SPEAKER_08]: more CBD in it than I expected.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I think some of that goes back to
how it's grown and many other different
[SPEAKER_08]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sure, this conversation is kind of
getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also I wanted to mention one thing about
autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're saying that these other
cannabinoids are good for the immune
[SPEAKER_06]: system or whatever, hey, most of these
autoimmune diseases are caused by an
[SPEAKER_06]: overactive autoimmune system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the last thing you want to do is
stimulate your immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but there's a lot of the cannabinoids
and even terpenes that don't stimulate the
[SPEAKER_04]: immune response, but they suppress the
immune response.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for instance, CBD suppresses immune
cells in a good way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, they did early studies trying
to show that this immune suppression was
[SPEAKER_04]: dangerous and they tried to spin it that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for autoimmune diseases, I think the
way that it can modify the immune response
[SPEAKER_04]: is protective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure the other lady,
excuse me, I don't know your name,
[SPEAKER_06]: but she said that CBD strengthens your
immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well strengthens, yeah, but I mean,
strengthens can mean a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would say it balances,
it keeps it under control, it helps
[SPEAKER_04]: suppress overactive immune responses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, this has a lot of evidence
just in people who are using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly believe you're saying the exact
opposite of the other young lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, she's saying exactly the same
thing that what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't actually isolating CBD saying
that that's the only thing that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for as far as an immune response.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was saying is that feeling good
helps stimulate or suppress the immune
[SPEAKER_02]: system because feeling good in our
emotions is an adaptogenic emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether you're feeling good or whether
you're calm, these are things that can
[SPEAKER_02]: both help your immune system, whether it's
suppressing it or stimulating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: The immune system is very complex,
so we can't just say suppressing or
[SPEAKER_04]: increase is a good thing.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so like if we could be both
stimulating and suppressing the immune
[SPEAKER_04]: system, it depends which branch or which
cell we're talking about because there are
[SPEAKER_04]: certain early immune cells that are very
critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had something like an invading
pathogen or a microbe or something like a
[SPEAKER_04]: bad bacteria, you want those early immune
responses to be there and active.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabinoids sometimes can help clear
an infection by stimulating some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: early immune responses, whereas we want
our later immune responses like our T
[SPEAKER_04]: helper cells, our T cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want those more suppressed because when
those cells come in over time and don't
[SPEAKER_04]: get turned off appropriately, they can
start leading to chronic inflammation and
[SPEAKER_04]: can start leading to autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also have to consider what part of
the immune response we're increasing or
decreasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also have to consider that
there's some immune cells that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when we think of a neutrophil out
of control, it's basically like you can
[SPEAKER_04]: think of it like a soldier with a machine
gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just killing everything that great if
you have a serious infection.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that goes unchecked, it's causing a
lot of damage to surrounding tissues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that type of immune response,
you might want it increased early on,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then you want it quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have other immune cells like T
cells that secrete IL-10, and those are
[SPEAKER_04]: immunosuppressive cytokines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when those types of immune
responses are increased, they actually
[SPEAKER_04]: suppress the immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets very complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we have to be a little bit
careful what we mean when we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about how cannabinoids and these other
compounds can interact with their immune
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm living with a wife who suffers from an
autoimmune disease, PBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the end effect of it is that you
have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, for a while with her
medication, she was drinking grapefruit
[SPEAKER_06]: juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it turned out grapefruit juice
was making her medicines act wrongly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to be really, really careful
and just broadly saying that the other
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, what's PBC?
[SPEAKER_06]: Primary biliary cirrhosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring up the point with the grapefruit
juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bad enough that she had to give a
new liver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring fruit juice and even some other
citrus juices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's affecting your cytochrome P450
enzymes in the liver that break down
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so some of those compounds can
affect drug metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you're taking a new compound or a
new drug, you can't just assume that
[SPEAKER_04]: everything you eat and the plants and the
herbs that you're consuming don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions with your medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's important to look into
supplements and how they can interact with
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs, especially if you're taking high
amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what's also interesting,
I recently did a 23andMe where you get
[SPEAKER_04]: your genetic analysis done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one part that was really interesting
with this test is they show, depending on
[SPEAKER_04]: different genetic mutations that you have,
so they're called SNPs, single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_04]: polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it doesn't necessarily mean that
your expression of that gene will be
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong, but it might be altered in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what they do is they show you some
of these potential gene alterations you
[SPEAKER_04]: might have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually go into the system if
you know what you're doing and see,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can actually look up, you might
metabolize cannabis differently,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you might be breaking down your basic
endocannabinoids like anandamide
[SPEAKER_04]: differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can check out those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I found cool is they show you
what kind of drugs you might be at risk of
[SPEAKER_04]: not metabolizing appropriately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I found out that if I ever have to go
on proton pump inhibitors, due to my
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic makeup, there's a certain drug
that if I took, it actually wouldn't work
[SPEAKER_04]: for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I can show my doctor like,
hey, if I had to go on these types of
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs, this is the kind I should go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's only going to evolve as
we get more information, more data,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we can get a little more personalized
with how we're taking our medications and
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing safety to reduce harmful side
effects from a lot of these medications
[SPEAKER_04]: and harmful interactions, especially with
other compounds like you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, like grapefruit juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: SNPs are exactly what all of these DNA
cannabis companies are identifying.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not actually examining the entire
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they're doing is looking at 20,000,
30,000, 40,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about them in reference to
human genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just bringing up our favorite gal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask Joshua and Kelly to go a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought up a comment about organic
farming and how it can be done
[SPEAKER_04]: legitimately versus, I guess, when you're
just slapping on the organic label,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it doesn't necessarily mean you're
doing true organic practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering if you could speak a
little bit to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what we believe is that just
because it has an OMRI label on it or just
[SPEAKER_02]: because it has a USDA organic
certification, it doesn't mean that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: truly organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there's a big misnomer in
this industry as a whole, especially about
[SPEAKER_02]: what OMRI is.
[SPEAKER_02]: OMRI is a review board.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a materials review board,
which means that they can take a bag of
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa and they can say, yeah,
we're going to put an OMRI stamp on this
[SPEAKER_02]: because this bag of alfalfa can be used in
the production for organic use or it can
[SPEAKER_02]: be used for organic use production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that OMRI has gone all the
way down the list to find out exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: farm that that particular bag of alfalfa
came from to find out that it's organic
[SPEAKER_02]: and even actually find out if it's even
non-GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important for people to
know your farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to vital garden supply,
then ask the guys there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've probably gone all the way down the
list to know exactly where a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients or additions or microbiology
that you're putting into your soils or
[SPEAKER_02]: your teas or your brews, you've really got
to find out where it's coming from because
[SPEAKER_02]: certification isn't going to give you that
full proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Alex said from SC Labs,
the more that we get into testing,
[SPEAKER_09]: the more we're going to find things like
glyphosate and different things that come
[SPEAKER_09]: through to contaminate our flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it becomes increasingly important to
know exactly what you're putting in to
[SPEAKER_09]: your farms, into your teas, and into your
soils because we know that our plants are
[SPEAKER_09]: intelligent, thinking, feeling beings with
roots that go in and intelligently find
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients and transform it into medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when it's doing that, it needs to be
from a pure standpoint.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we've chosen to do a pure
certification type thing, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: utilizing testing and toxicity levels with
what you're inputting into your gardens to
[SPEAKER_09]: know that you're getting things as pure as
possible in a contaminated world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we realize nothing's perfect,
but we're trying to go the extra mile to
[SPEAKER_09]: not just take an OMRI certification as the
be all, end all of purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And encouraging people to really grow
their own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea if you really want to know
exactly where your nutrients are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from and you really want to know what it
is, then if you're keeping your farm as
[SPEAKER_02]: much closed loop as you possibly can,
then you know exactly where they're coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from and you know exactly what your inputs
are and exactly what's going into your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you recognize how easy it is to get
contaminated by your neighbor,
[SPEAKER_09]: which other large farms often get
contaminated by their neighbors and that's
[SPEAKER_09]: an overspray issue or a groundwater issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot to that, but did you
have something to say, Brian?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just reiterating what you guys
said about, you know, there's more than
[SPEAKER_08]: what's just in the label, but there's also
where the sources come from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is something that we really take
into consideration and make sure that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we have accountability with all
the raw materials that go into all of our
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's true, like the word compost
alone, like the word compost, most people
[SPEAKER_08]: think it's organic, but there's so much
compost out there that's full of
[SPEAKER_08]: glyphosate and other terrible things that
are definitely not going to help your
[SPEAKER_08]: plants or anything, help the environment
or any of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So accountability is really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this closed loop system that you guys
are always like huge on, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: developing and introducing people to is
also a great thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always like applaud people who go in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we do is we source products based
on cleanliness to help introduce them to
[SPEAKER_08]: organics and or provide them when it's on
a scale that they can't necessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: produce in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the combination of the combination of
what you guys do and what we do,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think is really helping propel people
make that switch because as you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of our customers both ours and
Dragonfly's have come from a background of
[SPEAKER_08]: learning about three part systems and
synthetic nutrients and sprays that take
[SPEAKER_08]: care of killing everything and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now they're changing a mindset.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really good to see like a lot,
a lot of even I'm seeing huge commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: farms looking for organic certification.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know the word certification scares
some people, but it is a step in the right
[SPEAKER_08]: direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is showing a sign of like
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that's a step in the right
direction because no, it's not a perfect
[SPEAKER_08]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I see some large cannabis farm like
going the extra mile and trying to get
[SPEAKER_08]: Envirocan certified or Clean Green or even
CDFA, that's California Department of Ag
[SPEAKER_08]: certification, that to me just shows
they're at least making effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this imperfect world, effort goes a
long way with me for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Intention goes a long way and we're
finding a lot of people are moving back to
[SPEAKER_09]: the land in this time of expansion of
cannabis gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people come to us that really
want to create systems that are more like
[SPEAKER_09]: an ecosystem garden rather than just a
monoculture crop garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's gonna be all things happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that there's gonna be Central
Valley, California, crazy blowout farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, it's no different than really
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can just look at food and take
that as an example or anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be about having a story,
being different, telling people how you're
[SPEAKER_09]: affecting the world and the earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a huge response from consumers
to find farms that are growing
[SPEAKER_09]: ecologically sound.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's a huge revelation to find
out that a lot of times, those cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: ratings are higher and we know farms that
have been on synthetic regimens or even
[SPEAKER_09]: organic ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditional organics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even traditional organic farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then started using more ferments and
started using more plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Compost teas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Medicines, more compost teas and started
realizing, whoa, when I built up my
[SPEAKER_09]: microbiology and my soil, I got higher
cannabinoid ratings on clones that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: been growing for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I have, we're talking three,
4% higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: Up to seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: Significant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's because of the plant vitality and
its ability to produce more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're trying to move more and more away
from the term MPK and moving more into
[SPEAKER_09]: just broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_09]: Full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't even put it, there's not enough
room on the page for those minerals and
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the more we put more of that in there,
the more of the plants responding by
[SPEAKER_09]: providing better medicine, more
cannabinoids, higher cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do firmly believe in biodynamic organic
gardening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was first exposed and trained by the
Alan Chadwick farm at UCSC back in 1973.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've grown organically, biodynamically
since that time for more than 40 years
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also know that it's not just belief
that I know that more and better and finer
[SPEAKER_06]: roots make healthier plants with more
terpenes, with higher percentages,
[SPEAKER_06]: and also it can increase cannabinoids a
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only used IPM with predators for more
than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I agree with really a lot of what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we can agree on some things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can agree on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we would agree on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just love THC, that's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just that the other
cannabinoids, if you have a medical reason
[SPEAKER_06]: for them, hey, more power to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was the one who created the
program to create varieties in extremely,
[SPEAKER_06]: like CBG that has 10%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a plant with hardly any other
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these were research tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that's the plant that
somebody wants, but you got to remember
[SPEAKER_06]: that when I started in this game 30 years
ago with medical cannabis, there was no
[SPEAKER_06]: source of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could not buy CBG.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could not buy THCB.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I created plants the natural way with
classical breeding that had them in very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very low to large amounts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is phenomenal, phenonominal,
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love that about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is what we're really
interested in as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people talk about isolates,
and isolates then goes into the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical and scientific world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our roots are in herbalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our roots are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our roots are in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really much more interested in the
plant as a whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the different concentrates that we
make, we're utilizing the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're utilizing the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves, the stalks, the flowers,
all of it to come up with the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I believe that as an herbalist
that the whole plant is offering
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we believe in using polypores and
mushrooms along with our cannabis too,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is just adding to the adaptogenic
abilities to go into our body so our body
[SPEAKER_09]: can make the right decision.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your body heals you the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chemotherapy doesn't necessarily kill
cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your body.
[SPEAKER_09]: That really kills it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chemo kills everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when it comes to just having the
ability to have more compounds and more
[SPEAKER_09]: abilities to flush, that's what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in British Columbia, it's frustrating
as a farmer to not have laboratories to
[SPEAKER_09]: work with.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like in California or Oregon or
Colorado or Washington where you can take
[SPEAKER_09]: a leaf and send it to a lab and
cannabinoid count out of a plant within
[SPEAKER_09]: four to six weeks or something in the
early stages.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're maybe around.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not common.
[SPEAKER_09]: People don't use them as much here in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as farmers and as observationalists for
the last 27 years working with this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant, we've had to use our
intuition and then study those plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been keeping around in our genetics
for that long and just being able to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I think that this is what's been
going on and this is what's been going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly enough, we were right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is something to intuition.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something to observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something to farming and then
also adding science as one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a full spectrum,
science is just one of the spectrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys can do analysis now if you
have an MMR or ACMPR licensing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband had his former MMR.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he has his ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can send, I think it changed in
the last year, patients can legally send
[SPEAKER_04]: their materials to have them tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Anandia, John Page's group at
UBC, they do testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll do cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll do terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it does get pricey, but
especially.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is totally new and awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really different than getting the
analysis from, say, Steep Hill or SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been able to just get more
information from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But UBC has been helpful to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have been really great.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a 19% CBD plant out of our
greenhouse two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought that it probably was.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to say something about the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble Man here for another few minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have had these conversations with
Steep Hill, with SC Labs, with Chimera.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that we really, I'm not trying to
shit on the labs that we do have.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we really need this sort of
cannabis-focused lab here in British
[SPEAKER_11]: Columbia, an SC-type experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked to those guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely been a conversation of
trying to sort of like, it would be,
[SPEAKER_11]: and Chimera obviously would be an amazing
lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an amazing person to be involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he knows a lot of the right people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully, it'll be a dialogue that
continues.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can get that, because I feel your
guys' pain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I forgot completely that you guys are
in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are in the Kootenays,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the Kootenays?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I can't hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're from the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_11]: From the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I love to see the Kootenays
representing all my brothers and sisters
[SPEAKER_11]: from the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_11]: From Caslow to Nelson.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I miss the Kootenays when I'm not
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll definitely make a point the next
time I come to the Kootenays to look you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome any time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing array of flavors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I muted?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing a mic check.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a little quiet, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still up it a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we can hear you better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I put these earbuds on that
have a mic in it, my computer then,
[SPEAKER_01]: once I disconnect the earbuds,
can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it basically mutes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'll keep them on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can hear you get there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved what you guys were saying about
the whole plant medicine and using the
[SPEAKER_11]: roots and the whole plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the triterpenoids that are in the
roots you're accessing and all these
[SPEAKER_11]: different things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the beautiful thing about cannabis
that I've really finally learned at 44
[SPEAKER_11]: years of age is that when I first got into
it and I got into water hash, I was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: water hash, water hash is the only,
it's got to be, it's got to be this,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I slowly learned certain things of
cannabis, and I think it was Irv,
[SPEAKER_11]: when Irv came on and talked about his
shitty Mississippi bunk weed that we were
[SPEAKER_11]: all like, oh, look, it kind of felt like
we knew.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he just said, guys, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So whatever the medicine that we prefer,
remember to never fight against the other
[SPEAKER_11]: options, particular medicine or whatever
it is, because there's so many people in
[SPEAKER_11]: this industry, in this community that can
use all of these different, sort of one of
[SPEAKER_11]: the new things I say is I don't ever fight
against anything we already have.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to fight for more.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't fight against access.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't fight against LPs or I don't fight
against dispensaries because they exist
[SPEAKER_11]: and we already have access points there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would I fight against those things?
[SPEAKER_11]: If I want something more, I can go out and
focus on that and create that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of people get lost in
sort of, well, I want dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how I do that is fight LPs with every
inch of my, well, that's not really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom gets Irv.
[SPEAKER_11]: Orders it for weed or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, people are like,
oh, no, no, I tweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, listen, just because you don't
like it, it's still an access point.
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this point, one thing we can all
agree on is that we need more access
[SPEAKER_11]: points, not less.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to just give you a lot of
respect for upholding ice water and full
[SPEAKER_09]: plant medicine over all the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been a big, huge proponent of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a really big deal as the
industry wants to jump into BHO and all
[SPEAKER_09]: these crazy oil extractions and whole
farms going into it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's BC Bubble Man doing all the
plant medicine, whole plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So big love to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Water and ice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Water and ice.
[SPEAKER_11]: People would always be like, my one big
thing that I would say is they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_11]: well, I like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm like, but would you drink it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: All life on Earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure water does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last time I checked.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of a new thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of my focuses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, water hash is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at this point in time, it was a
conversation that I had with Addison
[SPEAKER_11]: DeMora from Steep Hill a while ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he just says, I know you don't like
the BHO.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's a chemical.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's this, that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's like, man, I've seen this help.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's why I've sort of stopped my energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to fight against anything
that already exists.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love for it to be cleaner and
safer and better.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll focus on my solventless quit.
[SPEAKER_11]: My dry sift, my wet wash, and the rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, along with terpene extractions,
that'll be our little piece of pie that we
[SPEAKER_11]: can contribute.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's all these wonderful other
pieces of the pie when it comes to
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hemp is not just a plant that produces
50,000 commercial products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is a plant that produces an
infinite amount of medicines.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with 180 terpenes, or 140 that have
been categorized and 40 that have not,
[SPEAKER_11]: plus 85 plus cannabinoids, I think we can
all agree that we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I wanted to mention something,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need is an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess you don't need these days
really a degree in chemistry to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how to use these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty hands on and pretty easy to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have an HPLC, and I don't
know how many samples you have to send to
[SPEAKER_01]: lab before you really realize that,
hey, I could have spent all this money
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than a testing lab with my own
brand new equipment to measure these
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers myself and know what the plant
looks like myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLCs probably cost anywhere between
$35,000 used to maybe $40,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your testing costs are in the same
regime, you may want to consider,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than oh, you could still submit to
third party outside labs, but it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: great to have the instrumentation in house
so you can give your own numbers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the idea of actually just starting
a lab, like investing in a lab,
[SPEAKER_11]: getting together with Chimera and some
other people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe I invited SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, you guys have all this
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you guys come up to Canada?
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get an SC Labs going in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no P up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get the investment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can buy the machines.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get some people some jobs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought it was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started the conversation with Steve Hill
originally and then moved to labs and have
[SPEAKER_11]: had the conversation a few times with
Chimera.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something Vancouver desperately
needs.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a big cannabis community,
and it's just we're missing some really
[SPEAKER_11]: key components.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the same conversations,
not with Chimera, but with Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alec and SC Labs, and we were just
talking about how British Columbia over
[SPEAKER_09]: the years has done so much genetic
breeding and so many good things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would just be really nice to have
that backing to just even with tissue
[SPEAKER_09]: culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not of tissue culture of cloning,
but of being able to test leaf at a young
[SPEAKER_09]: plant life age so that you can start 500
seeds and know within six weeks which ones
[SPEAKER_09]: to go forward with.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, to progress our movement
forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's essential.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need this science background.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't cut it anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I got the Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the this, the that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like what are the cannabinoid
profiles and what are the terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: profiles?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me what the constituents are that
make up that name because people throw
[SPEAKER_11]: around names like it's going out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't tell you how many times in
this business I've seen this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crack some seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells like gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, I'm going to call it,
you know, such and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like name and name.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's this weird connection to like ego
where they're like they want to feel like
[SPEAKER_11]: they were a breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, just just let's let's
go straight forward with these.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first met Skunkman Sam,
when I first met him, God, it's been 20
[SPEAKER_11]: plus years now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said to me, he said, you know,
when I see when I see herb get tested,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was the GLC.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can confirm or not, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember if it was HPLC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or what it was, but he said he reckoned a
particular spike when when Skunk was in
[SPEAKER_11]: the hybrid, he would just be like,
yeah, there's number ones in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's that spike.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that was back in 97 or 99 or,
you know, 17 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was using a GC FID for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works better than HPLC for
cannabinoids, especially the acid forms.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need HPLC, but maybe MS.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what was FID again?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's at the tip of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Flame ionization detector.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does is as the stream of gas comes
off the chromatographic column.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think of a column is just like a
distillation column and things are
[SPEAKER_01]: separated based on their different
differences in boiling points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as those partition gases come
through at that point, they're sent
[SPEAKER_01]: through the flame ionization detector,
which basically just looks for any organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that's being burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when organic matter is being burned in
that stream, the flame ionization starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to receive a signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you just get an increase in the
peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a way of detecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use GC FID.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's pretty pretty common.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other people and I prefer something
called GC mass spec, where your that
[SPEAKER_01]: effluent as it comes off of the
chromatographic column goes right into an
[SPEAKER_01]: electron impact mass spectrometer,
which measures the molecular weight of the
[SPEAKER_01]: material that's coming off as it's eluding
from the column.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, what's the price difference between
GC MS and GC FID?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I can give you some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I'm not endorsing this system,
but I just recently for a client made a
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation on purchasing the shimazu
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the GC FID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And GC MS with a headspace measurements at
a headspace is an important measurement to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to measure the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good for terpene and also just
to confirm that there's no residual
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that instrument itself costs a
little over $100,000, I believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new from shimazu.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their GC MS with the headspace
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis analyzer, which is their HPLC
instrument, runs about 60 to $65,000 brand
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get a HPLC, you know,
for probably neighborhood of 20 to $25,000
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of pharmaceutical companies
who redeploy those things all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a considerable aftermarket for
slightly used HPLCs that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, just to plug out to,
you know, the farmers who want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: that information on their own,
even if they are mandated by regulation to
[SPEAKER_01]: do third party testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always great to have third party
testing when you have your own results to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare your third party results to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you see some anomalous data
point, you at least have a point of
[SPEAKER_01]: reference to go back to the testing
company and say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your results say this, but our results
done in this in such way calibrated on
[SPEAKER_01]: this instrument run by this trained person
gives us these results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's just more enabling to
the producer, especially if you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates to have HPLC in-house to be
able to measure the cannabinoids potency
[SPEAKER_01]: at each step along the way of from
extraction to the refinement of isolates
[SPEAKER_01]: to crystallization.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no better way to determine how
pure your cannabinoid acids are than to
[SPEAKER_01]: have an HPLC make that determination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also say that for terpenes GCFID or
GCMS, that is the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of the amounts of material
there, which is a lot less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're doing in the head space
measurement or what you're doing in the GC
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement is you are measuring the
volatiles that's coming off of a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, you're measuring basically the
vapor affluent that's coming off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just been you got to remember that
the GC injection port for a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols are anywhere between 200 to 250
degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly not nail temperature,
but injecting a cannabis extract that was
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps extracted under low temperature
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one that's going to change its
terpene content on heating up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been my thing is that when
you put a sample into the injection port
[SPEAKER_01]: of your GC, there's invariably some
chemistry that's going to happen with the
[SPEAKER_01]: most sensitive terpenes that are in there
at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't avoid that from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that that creates at the
injection port is sort of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, like a nail surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are any heavies or residuals in
your extracts, it will start to build up
[SPEAKER_01]: in your injection port.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's absolutely maintains one of the
things that you must do to maintain your
[SPEAKER_01]: GC is cleaning out that injection port to
make sure that there's no crap and you run
[SPEAKER_01]: blanks in between your replicates to make
sure that you're not seeing any residual
[SPEAKER_01]: from the from the previous injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you shoot a blank, you should get a
blank response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically what we do like a lot of
these things, Sam, is we like to add an
[SPEAKER_01]: internal standard, which we weigh out on
an analytical, very, very sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we add the analytical internal
standard to the sample, we know to the nth
[SPEAKER_01]: degree how much material is in there so we
could sort of correlate the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: material to the peak height.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that gives us a way of measuring
taking the internal peak heights from your
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatogram, which kind of looks like a
heartbeat kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's peaks and valleys and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those peaks represent all
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue, again, with chromatography
is you have to assume that each peak is a
[SPEAKER_01]: single compound and there's not multiple
peaks, but sometimes there's shoulders and
[SPEAKER_01]: these peaks aren't always symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's multiple peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple things that can be in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as with some of these terpenes,
when you heat them up, they form multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: isomeric products which can resolve on the
GC as individual peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not extraordinary to see,
you know, multiple more terpenes on
[SPEAKER_01]: heating them up than where they would be
at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working with a group in Fort
Collins, Colorado called Discover 64
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with the Colorado State
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using some very highly sensitive
multi-dimensional NMR techniques where we
[SPEAKER_01]: look at both proton and carbon signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do is I used to say this
was undressing the Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the painting of the Mona Lisa is
across the street from you, you can look
[SPEAKER_01]: out your window and you could say,
ah, yes, it's the painting of the Mona
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we look at the NMR spectrum of
a lot of cannabis extracts, what we see
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly is THCA, as we should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are highly bred for THC
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Sam, we're growing these things
to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we've looked at things that are
like the AJ cut of the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've actually looked at also some of
JJ's Nigerian haze, it's a textbook
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum for THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we can do in NMR is we can
basically undress the Mona Lisa and take
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mona Lisa out of the painting so we
could actually see the outfit she's
[SPEAKER_01]: wearing and everything else that's in the
painting that you sort of take for granted
[SPEAKER_01]: when you look across the street and
there's the Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that these things produce THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The factories producing THCA, according to
Sam and everything else, is the star of
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other supporting actors
in this movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA is like, winning the Oscar for the
best actor, that would be THCA,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be up for that role, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the supporting actor,
which is probably CBD, we could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other various, forget that analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, again, I think I wanted
to bring this back home to HPLC testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and the need to actually both look at the
cannabinoid acid profile at room
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, which you can't do by HPLC,
but we think we can do by
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-dimensional NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're sort of looking at this very
sort of systematically to try to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other components when we take THCA
out of the picture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we no longer see THCA,
we see everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing about the NMR is you
don't have to heat it up, which is unlike
[SPEAKER_01]: the GCF ID, which as soon as you heat it
up, you have chemistry at 250 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_11]: We only have 1% left.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just wanted to say hi to everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm with Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hiding in the bathroom because it's
air conditioned.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like 40 degrees outside Celsius right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just wanted to say goodbye to everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go do this doctor training
and hopefully we'll see you guys in the
[SPEAKER_11]: near future.
[SPEAKER_11]: Past churchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with this, Tony.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for doing that work down there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to see you Tony.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we're going to try to hopefully
develop a room temperature technique where
[SPEAKER_01]: we can look at terpene profiles that don't
have to go through an injection port at
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 and 250 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that this is going to be
something that's going to be coming to a
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab near you, but I think what we
can probably do is characterize this on a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of different examples and publish
this and make sure that this is widely
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to everybody so you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an interest in doing this
work, you can go to your local university
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got one of these machines and
perhaps recreate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, plug for NMR.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with NMR though is the sample
cost prep is too expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot more expensive than doing a GCF
ID prep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's more than just taking a sample
that you get submitted and putting it into
[SPEAKER_01]: your robotic arm, which just basically
takes a little squirt and shoots it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the injection port and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to basically sit down with a
group of very highly trained,
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated people to understand that
we're going to run this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we looking for and what are we
going to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can get the NMR spectrum and
it looks just like a mess to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been looking at these for,
oh God, how long has it been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 1982 I think when I first started
looking at NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I've learned to basically
see the forest through the trees and not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily scared by looking at mixtures
of compounds and be able to deconvolute
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very complex mixtures into their
individual components because we know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual components look like with
this type of measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, stay tuned, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not going to be something
again that's coming, that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard routine test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I do know of a couple labs now
that service the California market that
[SPEAKER_01]: will run an NMR for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why someone would submit a
sample for NMR analysis is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: unknown, but if you're making something
like crystalline THCA, it'd be really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good to make sure that the purity
is what the purity is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do run it by proton NMR,
it's strikingly pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like to me, at least the Mona
Lisa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I understand where you're coming
from and the point, but again,
[SPEAKER_07]: I go back to the same thing for a high
throughput lab where you're not screening
[SPEAKER_07]: one sample.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're screening through like for me,
I'm screening populations, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need to get the cannabinoid data and
the terpene data on like a thousand
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not economically viable to do that by
NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, we should, we should talk
offline buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I wanted to point out too
is I kind of, I was trying to log in,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I kind of got a little bit of the
conversation, but you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about, there's no labs in,
in, in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there are labs in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: John Page has an idea, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they've got a full, full set up for
all sorts of screening.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do screening for the LPs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and they can now legally, you know,
accept cannabis from patients,
[SPEAKER_07]: which wasn't the case about six months
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the things that was
updated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, wagon wheel was a company that tried
to set up and do dispensary testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're testing through dispensaries and
health Canada lost their fucking mind,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They, when they tried to go after them,
they tried to really make their life hell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not, it's not California.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, it's not Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we don't have that written into the
regulations the way that they are
[SPEAKER_07]: permitted down in, down in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it would be really tough for SC
labs to just roll into Canada and set up
[SPEAKER_07]: because they're operating outside of the
set of regulations that exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody buys their own GC or HPLC and
does their own in-house analysis,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that legal?
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have to get, again, you'd have to go
and get standards.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not, this is like pretty fancy
equipment for home growers to be playing
[SPEAKER_07]: with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and, and most people don't have the
skills.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to be, to really have the skills
to be able to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B who's one of our regular
panelists has got a GC over in his thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark, listen, no offense to Johnny B,
but his results are like all, but useless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not that's not it's about science.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like he yes, he gets peaks coming off
of his chromatograph, but great.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nothing It's he's not doing turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not accurately quantifying anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So It's yeah, anybody could do that But
again, what's the point of just having
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers on your on it's not about just
having numbers It's about having accurate
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's the whole point of the lab is
to have an accurate medicine measurement
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's in the medicine right and that's
why I like we've seen a lot of press
[SPEAKER_01]: lately about these handheld scanners and
we've talked about it on church before we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to go there but certainly a
order of magnitude less expensive than an
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC would be like one of these You know
sort of near IR measurements that claim
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can do cannabinoid and terpene
Profiles based on just holding a sample up
[SPEAKER_01]: to one of these things that you can buy in
a Pelican case I Think again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean if you're out in the bush and
You're like is this CBD is this THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again just to go back to I think what
Joshua was saying earlier Which is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: go on our instincts because we know these
plants and we have a connection with them
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's like one of the things that you
just You you sense, but it's also great to
[SPEAKER_01]: have something like Even as crude as it is
Johnny B's GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do a quick injection and say hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a THC Variety not a CBD variety and
just be able to make that kind of level
[SPEAKER_01]: determination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that quantitative?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, should that go on a label?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, is that going to substitute for an
analysis done at Steep Hill?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it's giving a grower an Extra set
of eyes to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, here's a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's maybe it's secondhand Maybe I only
got it for whatever and it's pieced
[SPEAKER_01]: together with a couple, you know flanges
with duct tape or whatever But maybe you
[SPEAKER_07]: can get that You can get that same kind of
qualitative information off of like $10
[SPEAKER_01]: TLC plate Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep we used to know see 30 years ago and
If all you want to do is get a finger to
[SPEAKER_06]: point in the right direction TLC works
fine, but for quantitative.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so fine Well, let's give props to
Kevin McCurn who's really taking this UPCR
[SPEAKER_07]: home thing and he started to add a whole
bunch of assays.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going back and forth with him over
the weekend and They were the two well
[SPEAKER_07]: test just a simple color color metric test
They can identify essentially they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing away with TLC now, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, she muted Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I accidentally sorry the muting police And
now I can't unmute him sorry Ryan I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know what I did there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry Ryan just turn on no worries Right
so for tip for a ten for a three dollar
[SPEAKER_07]: prep you can get like ten Assays out of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for three out of three of the wells You
can get the sex of the plant and whether
[SPEAKER_07]: what the chemo type is out of three wells
so out of three of ten You know wells on
[SPEAKER_07]: your prep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a lot of information to get for
three bucks Right, and it's definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: cheaper than TLC.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes less time than TLC Yeah,
I mean to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a p a pH paper I mean,
you know, I remember when we used to have
[SPEAKER_01]: she have like red and Blue litmus paper
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have these little pH strips that tell me
any range of pH no matter whether I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic or basic So yeah, these are just
constant innovations that help people
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Props off to Kevin sure that Kevin
was gonna join us Maybe Natasha Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, there was some issues with the link
some people were having problems if you
[SPEAKER_01]: see anyone who He's a family guy who
spends his weekend with families like
[SPEAKER_01]: probably most of us should but Minor just
crashed on the bed here Speaking of I
[SPEAKER_08]: think I'm about to dip out guys Well,
thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you Good seeing you guys Josh
and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad we got to see each other before
the Emerald Cup again this year Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: no kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice to be able to see you more
times than that It's always great seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: you and being with you Brian We love what
you do and we love who you are in this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry Same with you guys for sure big
supporter for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get together more often.
[SPEAKER_08]: See what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that We'd love to have you up here
for a little visit bring the family.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you're always welcome down here,
too Okay props Brian Thank you,
[SPEAKER_07]: I dropped a link in our chat maybe one of
the moderators can post that in the in the
[SPEAKER_07]: in the live chat feed so people could
everybody else can see it but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: essentially the cost breakdown and a
little a little kind of ad for for
[SPEAKER_07]: McCurnin's you PCR test
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to welcome Selena Wong to
the room Hi, Selena.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Selena was with us last week So yeah
Pretty good It's a beautiful Sunday here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so honored to be here again Thanks
again for the invite and I have to say the
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation has been so fascinating so
far on all fronts My mind is just
[SPEAKER_10]: absolutely blown.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I just go silent and just absorb
this around Excuse me And I also just
[SPEAKER_10]: wanted to mention Kelly just kudos for you
and catching babies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that work that you're doing
Yes, thank you and everybody else,
[SPEAKER_10]: of course but it was just a little a
little piece of the conversation that was
[SPEAKER_10]: just touched on and glossed over but
people understand how I believe birthing
[SPEAKER_10]: is such a huge a huge thing and the fact
that you're there facilitating women and
[SPEAKER_10]: empowering them to Reclaim their power and
their birthing and being there to really
[SPEAKER_10]: mirror that strength I think is really
beautiful and I love what you're doing
[SPEAKER_10]: both of you Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely take the birthing As
seriously as the first seed so we see it
[SPEAKER_02]: the same way You know that first breath is
just important as that first sprout and
[SPEAKER_09]: the health of a whole entire lifetime so
amazing using birth water to Sprout your
[SPEAKER_04]: first That's interesting so tell us more
about that So what is it just because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a nutrient-rich medium and so you're
finding the seed sprout faster Or what's
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the advantage to doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just think that you know,
if you're gonna empty a tub It's really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice to empty it in their flower garden or
in their garden because that's just so
[SPEAKER_02]: much nicer It's like sacred waters and
it's looked at, you know Baby was born in
[SPEAKER_02]: that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not put it in your flower garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually do hose extensions to get
it to the flower gardens Even it's in the
[SPEAKER_10]: middle of winter You guys are so dedicated
that's beautiful that's so beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: people don't realize like there's a whole
other world to understanding birthing then
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the hospital and Legs up in the
strips and the pushing and the screaming
[SPEAKER_10]: and the pain.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be something so beautiful Yes,
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully agree magical otherworldly So
tapped in multi-dimensional experience
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, have you had any experiences in your
just with what you do with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_10]: facilitating birthing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it definitely comes in and out,
you know for me I I think that the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: reason how we even got into where I'm at
now today is because of learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: health and human health and women's health
and Then learning about small babies
[SPEAKER_02]: health because then that just has so much
to do with the mother as well You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are one at that time and then
utilizing all of those herbs That we used
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow an entire baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do those herbs do to grow a whole
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so then I started to be able to see
and you know the ganja plant as a feminine
[SPEAKER_02]: plant because which we normally choose all
of the females and Then give those
[SPEAKER_02]: feminine herbs to the plant for growth and
health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just absolutely no difference to
me You know, even if we study it with
[SPEAKER_02]: science or we look at it, you know in all
of the different realms of spirituality or
[SPEAKER_02]: practicality No, it's a very similar
similar thing life is life and health is
[SPEAKER_09]: health and you could You know feed male
Hormonal herbs to your male plants,
[SPEAKER_09]: which you know, there's no we do not have
a scientific paper to back that but it
[SPEAKER_09]: makes all the sense in the world to use
Nettle root for example tea On your male
[SPEAKER_09]: plants to just put more male supporting
Hormones and compounds into the soil which
[SPEAKER_09]: will feed the micros which the micros will
feed the plant, of course So anyway,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's full circle
[SPEAKER_10]: Nature gives abundantly I find and and she
knows how to compliment just so perfectly
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll find these companion plants just
sprouting up naturally around I'm curious
[SPEAKER_10]: just specifically with the birthing
process.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you worked with cannabis to help
facilitate a shift in perception perhaps
[SPEAKER_10]: on behalf of the mother or the people
around has there been an integrative
[SPEAKER_10]: portion of ceremony Around that even post
birth.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious you have so much
experience and wisdom Well, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely utilized just like many of the
other herbs, you know, I'd say that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like eight herbs I'm just making
up that number that I utilize,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know front in during the birthing
process and then maybe postmenopausal as
[SPEAKER_02]: well I mean postpartum as well
postmenopausal maybe that's where I'm at
[SPEAKER_02]: now Not yet clothes it's getting there
feeling it But yeah to be able to utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant in birth itself is fantastic,
you know also Women in breastfeeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: helping them relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like hops is utilized, you know,
and if hops isn't working Immediately then
[SPEAKER_02]: we might go to a nice cannabis brew tea
and it helps so much for the mother's milk
[SPEAKER_02]: to come down She's relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's maybe in a place that Feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now she's ready to nourish her baby
after, you know an extreme You know
[SPEAKER_09]: birthing process and hops is part of the
same family as the canvas to begin with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah It's another adaptogen be working
them together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, also, you know during the birthing
process of the labor and everything is a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot about Mind space and stuff and and
cannabis had can definitely be used to
[SPEAKER_09]: change the perspective Absolutely
definitely happened and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: different ritual that's gone into some of
the births that we've done and Kelly has
[SPEAKER_09]: done too for sure with other plant
medicine as well but yeah cannabis as also
[SPEAKER_09]: part of the pregnancy tea because the
pregnancy tea is a Crucial part of being
[SPEAKER_09]: pregnant is to be able to drink herbs the
whole entire time of pregnancy to build
[SPEAKER_09]: the uterus and the The walls and all the
muscles that you're going to be utilizing
[SPEAKER_09]: to for the transformation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Cannabis is part of that along with
medicinal mushrooms Along with fungi along
[SPEAKER_09]: with that magical not magic but magical
Mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we really utilize all the
adaptogenic herbs and that's the reason
[SPEAKER_02]: why we even got into cannabis It just
makes sense, you know when you're somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: who has deep respect for nature and The
medicinal and spiritual powers of these
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing adaptogens that are here to serve
us and we're here to serve them You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's this beautiful symbiotic love
relationship that we have with these
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants and when we bring them together
full circle then we're able to have you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, a real healing process I have a
great story just super quick That a
[SPEAKER_02]: mother, you know was not releasing her
placenta after birth.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just holding on You know,
it was her third baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: She hadn't had any cannabis during her
whole pregnancy because of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever feelings that she had,
you know surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was back in the early 90s and Just
was going on for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't internally bleeding everything
was fine, but you know We're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a little bit worried and finally I
looked at her and I said do you need a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to just have a toke here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, she took one toke and the
placenta was born and everybody could go
[SPEAKER_02]: on about their business So what it did was
it allowed her to be in that place of
[SPEAKER_02]: normalcy that she is normally you know
that she wasn't during the pregnancy and
[SPEAKER_02]: Find that yeah acceptance and centering so
that you know She could move on and accept
[SPEAKER_04]: this birth That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're bringing up the concept of yeah
cannabis being not only used Again,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were having a discussion previous about
cannabis medical versus rec but using it
[SPEAKER_04]: to facilitate Shifts in birth or and I
wanted to bring it back to Selena.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's also started doing I don't know what
the proper word is but she facilitates
[SPEAKER_04]: marriages and she's incorporating cannabis
in that ceremony also and I thought that
[SPEAKER_04]: was a really Just beautiful thought of I
know personally my husband and I when we
[SPEAKER_04]: got married out in Dauphin, Manitoba We
even took pictures in the hemp fields that
[SPEAKER_04]: were growing around our area and just even
standing there and the plants and just
[SPEAKER_04]: even that was really Was actually my
favorite part of the wedding was normally
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't the picture part is kind of not
really our thing but The way our
[SPEAKER_04]: photographer helped us calm and it just
felt like a really nice little intimate
[SPEAKER_04]: moment where we could Be alone and we were
there kind of hidden under these huge hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so even just the presence of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, Selena, can you tell us a
little bit more about what do you do in
[SPEAKER_04]: these wedding ceremonies?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you incorporate cannabis or how
do you intend to do this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's so many ways So, okay,
we actually had our first pilot yesterday,
[SPEAKER_10]: which was really exciting For this wedding
it was really intimate small We ended up
[SPEAKER_10]: actually just doing the photos at the
farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just about to crop out which is
really exciting so everybody is just all
[SPEAKER_10]: the girls are just totally perked and
happy and Vibrant and glowing and just
[SPEAKER_10]: like so supercharged.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for them, they're pretty spiritual and
very grounded and their love is I Want to
[SPEAKER_10]: say pure but it's even more than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just so sweet and for them it was a
It was a really unique experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually got to go and meet the girls.
[SPEAKER_10]: I walked them around the greenhouse I
introduced them to a few different
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivars that were growing there We
smelled the different turbines and we had
[SPEAKER_10]: some fun just talking about Soil mediums
and then what we did is we had a really
[SPEAKER_10]: fun photo shoot and For them it was really
about connecting with the plants I think
[SPEAKER_10]: only one person in the wedding party had
ever been in A grow ever so it was a new
[SPEAKER_10]: experience for everybody and we had some
guests that were from Sweden So it was
[SPEAKER_10]: extra new and very taboo and very exciting
The ways that we're hoping to incorporate
[SPEAKER_10]: this in the next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Officially, we're not actually going to
be launching until 2018 we are booking now
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already got a couple of spots that
are booked which is exciting and it really
[SPEAKER_10]: depends on It really depends on the bride
and groom or the two people that are
[SPEAKER_10]: getting married and their comfort level
Some people want to participate with the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis by ingesting or vaporizing or
smoking which is great We're also mindful
[SPEAKER_10]: of people's tolerances and having a good
time I'm also mindful that alcohol is
[SPEAKER_10]: usually present at weddings So what we're
planning on doing is having like a
[SPEAKER_10]: precursory education piece where we really
get to know the couple and we really get
[SPEAKER_10]: to know What's exciting for them?
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be something as simple as having it
integrated into boutonnieres and beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: bouquets.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the idea Of actually having the the
buds in the bouquet and you Get to do like
[SPEAKER_10]: hang dry at the end and in a year instead
of having your frozen wedding cake You get
[SPEAKER_10]: to partake in your beautiful Bouquet which
should be so fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that There's lots of different ways
we How about the obvious party favors?
[SPEAKER_01]: For all these people who come from all
over Kingdom come just to come to your
[SPEAKER_01]: wedding and especially celebrate Your pre
you're a total, you know this day that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've put together you want to send them
back with a little bit of nuggets So it'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be great to have like a little little
parting gift of something I guess we're
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking about taking that the next step
further where as we interview the couple
[SPEAKER_10]: we're hoping to do it a year prior so we
can actually kind of get a vibe on What
[SPEAKER_10]: their cultivar would be and one of the
ideas that we're playing around with is
[SPEAKER_10]: actually growing a crop for that Couple
for their wedding something that they
[SPEAKER_10]: could give their guests That's just for
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So unique kind of like a beautiful vintage
wine.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of a kind and Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many different things you can
do with this You can go one step further
[SPEAKER_06]: and when you make little bouquets of
cannabis flowers make them with seeded
[SPEAKER_10]: buds You know what that's like such a
brilliant idea I was thinking about you
[SPEAKER_10]: know seed paper I've been to weddings
where we had this one mother.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was so dedicated She made seed paper
into little hearts and they scattered them
[SPEAKER_10]: all over the farm and it was it was the
parents farm So forever these seeds will
[SPEAKER_10]: be growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that idea of just having it as a
seeded bud lives on forever and just think
[SPEAKER_10]: about how much that would feed that couple
like one of the ideas that we're pairing
[SPEAKER_10]: with this is This concept that we call
farm to able which is growing your own
[SPEAKER_10]: food having your own food pharmacy in your
own backyard So being able to provide
[SPEAKER_10]: simple gardens for people right off the
hop and when people know how to see it
[SPEAKER_10]: save seed They have a garden forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: So integrating cannabis into that as well
So part of what we're gifting to the
[SPEAKER_10]: couples is a garden So that could be a
part of that which I think would be really
[SPEAKER_01]: fun So what if instead of throwing rice as
the couple exits the And if you're hungry
[SPEAKER_10]: you can like catch and just have a little
snack be so good It'll just basically feed
[SPEAKER_01]: all the birds in the area But it would be
interesting to come back in a few weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if any of those seeds sprouted
It's a little plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can guarantee it, you know Imagine
having the wedding down by the creek side
[SPEAKER_10]: that Creek would just be so pungent by the
fall.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be gorgeous Yeah, I would love that
and you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've noticed more and more people are so
open to it and really like it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_10]: to be like big smoke out fast It doesn't
have to you know, and it could be
[SPEAKER_10]: absolutely but it doesn't have to be you
know, sometimes grandmas are there and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not totally keen but the other
idea too is Like part of my other business
[SPEAKER_10]: is I produce cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just like Tash and her beautiful
topicals.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got her online and We're thinking
about having Just a beautiful gift to the
[SPEAKER_10]: bride The wedding party and of course the
mothers of the bride and groom so to prime
[SPEAKER_10]: their skin to get them comfortable We have
these really beautiful Obvious
[SPEAKER_10]: suppositories for women's health So having
that is something that could be in
[SPEAKER_10]: conjunction with you know The wedding
night to help her get primed and
[SPEAKER_10]: lubricated and plumped up and ready and
juicy and really excited to engage And
[SPEAKER_10]: also for him because they smell like
delicious chocolate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So You can go downtown and have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe I just saw that on hash
church But yeah, you know, like there's
[SPEAKER_10]: there's such a multifaceted Realm here
that we can explore with the weddings and
[SPEAKER_10]: I really think this is just the beginning
so I feel fortunate enough to live in an
[SPEAKER_10]: area where we work really closely with our
farmers and we've got some beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: locations that I've already been offered
up and Yeah, it just seems like a natural
[SPEAKER_10]: next step into a way to integrate sacred
sacred ceremony so the other part of what
[SPEAKER_10]: I do is I'm actually a Reverend so I do
perform ceremonies Mary Berry and baptized
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I love your happy dance because
that's how I feel inside which is pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: rad So what what we're hoping to do is
also you know to people that are open is
[SPEAKER_10]: incorporate a full cannabis ceremony in
with their wedding Which would be really
[SPEAKER_10]: rad Just to bring in the elements bring in
the the beautiful energies of Lady Canna
[SPEAKER_10]: Bay and having that blessing be a part of
it Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you can you hear us Marcus?
Yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus He's Dustin Bowles Dustin Bowles,
can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Marcus today, I guess All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see when he can hear us So,
you know, thank you for sharing all that
[SPEAKER_04]: that sounds all really exciting and Dave
and I might have to do a second wedding
[SPEAKER_04]: just to check out some of your services or
a ceremony or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah consider maybe You and Dave would
love to be our Our pilot couple where we
[SPEAKER_10]: could actually roll out a full ceremony
And you guys could be like our tester
[SPEAKER_10]: where you can let us know what you like
what you don't like What else we can
[SPEAKER_10]: integrate give us some feedback?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a yes because I would love that
Yeah, and if you guys want to like
[SPEAKER_10]: recreate some awesome wedding photos I
would love to bring you to some locations
[SPEAKER_04]: and and introduce you to some girls Very
cool So I want to bring the conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: back to something Joshua and Kelly
mentioned before About some of the how you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys were using the whole plants and I'm
really interested in the cannabis roots I
[SPEAKER_04]: have a review paper that was just accepted
for publication So it should be out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: next few months and we wrote it together
with dr Ethan Russo and we put together a
[SPEAKER_04]: summary of the historical use of the
cannabis roots in the medical applications
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of it is topicals for Arthritis
inflammation a lot of mentions of gout So
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I was curious what are you guys
doing with the roots?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you incorporating that into your
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: we do a Almost a couple different kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well we utilize it in almost every
application as much as we possibly can
[SPEAKER_02]: only because Whenever you're utilizing
herbs the idea Of utilizing the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: herb, you know the roots and also getting
it in different cycles of its life You
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you want to create a full spectrum
medicine of any type of a plant Then you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to maybe create a tincture that has
the spring shoots that has the spring
[SPEAKER_02]: roots that has the fall shoots That has
the flowers that has the seeds that has
[SPEAKER_02]: you know The full spectrum of the plant
and it's not that there's any science.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of you know, traditional
medicinal values You know that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah wise women as well as Chinese
medicine as well as are you better that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes back?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know well beyond anything that Western
medicine or science, you know today has to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer so there's some type of a value in
that But I believe that that's probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: real observational, you know things so we
do that in cannabis We do a slow cook oil
[SPEAKER_02]: that we actually put in a crock pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's on the lowest of the low heat
simmer simmer down Yeah, and we Utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots in there the flowers the leaves
the stalks We put maybe 11 different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of mushrooms in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put polypores like fomis fomentarius
the Iceman Amadou fungus the artist conch,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is the Ganoderma aplanitum and then
the red belt the fomis Fomitopsis
[SPEAKER_09]: pinnacola Fomis fomentarius.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the fomis fomentarius is the Chaga
which we can find in our forest here Those
[SPEAKER_09]: are the ones that are really available
like crazy and so we get it fresh slice it
[SPEAKER_09]: up and put the slices in the Sun and dry
it in the Sun to accumulate the vitamin D
[SPEAKER_09]: and Then we take those slices and utilize
them in the in the slow cook We can do
[SPEAKER_09]: different kinds of oils, but maybe a
coconut oil olive oil combination works
[SPEAKER_09]: good to Because of the consistency that it
comes out with in the end and then add a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of other herbs in there Having to do
with other adaptogens, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we utilize astragalus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We utilize fautee You know sort of
bringing in all of the different realms
[SPEAKER_02]: and every time we utilize those licorice
Yeah, those plants we make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the full spectrum of the plant
We're also utilizing the herbs and the
[SPEAKER_09]: leaves in those plants as well And then
you can use that oil and put it in gel
[SPEAKER_09]: caps and get a really easy To use oil or
use it topically or use it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a lot of course you can
use it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah with the The tincture is used
similarly I mean we put a similar blend
[SPEAKER_09]: into the into the tincture and we use
we'll use a homemade organic alcohol
[SPEAKER_09]: that's you know that we know exactly
what's went gone into a type thing to
[SPEAKER_09]: Break it down and then do a speed your
Type tincture with it where we burn the
[SPEAKER_09]: material afterwards and utilize the ash
And then you're bringing the whole cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: of life and death of the entire plant Into
the medicine which is what we consider
[SPEAKER_02]: full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with our Wow Incredible healing
incredible stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and also just to add Exactly what
we're talking about in our medicine is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way that we make our tea brews for
our plants So we utilize all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different herbs and the whole entire life
cycle of the plant to put back into The
[SPEAKER_02]: soil as well So there's really no
separation in the medicines and the teas
[SPEAKER_02]: that we give ourselves and the medicine
and the teas that we give our plants
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are serious I love how complex
your formulas are and that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: considering Not only what part of the
plant but the season the growth the even
[SPEAKER_04]: like you said the life and the death of
the plant and how Yeah, the whole profile
[SPEAKER_04]: of nutrients and functional properties
shift as the plant matures and changes
[SPEAKER_04]: When you guys were talking about what you
were doing with the roots one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting things that came up when we
were looking at the historical use and as
[SPEAKER_04]: you were saying I totally agree there's
value in these traditional ways of
[SPEAKER_04]: preparing herbs and Science hasn't caught
up to a lot of these ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean like even with a lot of the Plants
and herbs that I look at there might be
[SPEAKER_04]: basic test tube experiments or some animal
experiments kind of confirming some basic
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanisms, but We're not there yet with
what we know through firsthand experience
[SPEAKER_04]: versus having double-blind placebo
controlled trials to confirm these things
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know if we'll ever get them
because some of these plants are so
[SPEAKER_04]: Complicated and they work so broad
spectrum They don't just target one
[SPEAKER_04]: specific things like a lot of traditional
or not even traditional but pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: medications do but anyway what I wanted to
bring up with the roots One thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: kept coming up through history is They
used water to help extract A lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds in the roots and as we know a
lot of the most I mean all the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and the terpenes are fat
soluble Compounds and so usually we're
[SPEAKER_04]: using like coconut oils or other fats to
extract Things whereas with the roots it
[SPEAKER_04]: just kept coming up throughout history
that they were using water Extractions and
[SPEAKER_04]: so when we looked a little deeper into
some of the compounds that had been
[SPEAKER_04]: isolated from the roots there were some
unique alkaloids such as Cannabis sativine
[SPEAKER_04]: that was found in the roots and so I'm
wondering if maybe with Water extractions
[SPEAKER_04]: and when you're also doing the alcohol
extractions you'd be able to pull out some
[SPEAKER_04]: of those more water soluble type compounds
and maybe even Improving the effectiveness
[SPEAKER_04]: of your root Compounds with what you're
doing because one of the blinds we tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the blinds we tried was we
used and my husband has his MMR license
[SPEAKER_04]: and his ACM PR license as I said before so
He's been a grower and I've had access to
[SPEAKER_04]: plants to try out some of these basic
recipes and so my husband Dave was the one
[SPEAKER_04]: who first clued me into trying to work
with the roots and the recipe we found was
[SPEAKER_04]: basically a blend of Fat and water and in
a crock pot and they would use that to
[SPEAKER_04]: extract and then basically put it in the
freezer to separate pour off the water But
[SPEAKER_04]: you can even keep that water extract for
something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean you're more at risk for microbial
growth and other issues So it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have as long as a shelf life as the fat
soluble blends, but Be interesting to
[SPEAKER_04]: start working with those different
extracts and again, you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: additional compounds and that still need a
lot of work to be studied and clarified
[SPEAKER_02]: what exactly these compounds are yeah,
and it's really interesting what you bring
[SPEAKER_02]: up to because it really differentiates the
difference between the fresh herbs because
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that's water-soluble or you know
aqueous and an eye, you know in a water
[SPEAKER_02]: solution You want to be able to utilize
that fresh, you know, you could utilize it
[SPEAKER_02]: in your Juicing, you know the leaves are
not gonna be as good in anything when as
[SPEAKER_02]: soon as they're dried or they're utilized
in a in a water extraction or oil
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction the same way even a tincture
extraction it really does it changes the
[SPEAKER_02]: the properties of making like a beautiful
steeped tea or something that you press
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh and raw and That just goes into
access the ability for people to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow their own cannabis plants,
you know really easy So they can press
[SPEAKER_02]: them and they can drink the fresh juice
because there's nothing better than
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking the fresh juice from those roots
You can't even you know, no water
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: No tea solution and nothing can be quite
the same the same way with Fresh pressing
[SPEAKER_02]: any of your leaves, you know getting that
juice That's sort of a one-of-a-kind
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and that's utilizing fresh as
opposed to something that you keep
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term like say the oil and and and I
really I'm agreeing with you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's interesting that science is now
pairing up with traditions because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding and realizing that You know these
herbal remedies that you know that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: given us recipes for for a long time now
science is really proving and So it's
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, you're talking about herbs
and reading these papers and it's just
[SPEAKER_10]: really wonderful It's like it's finally
validating what we've known all along that
[SPEAKER_10]: we've seen throughout Human history,
you know these these ways have worked for
[SPEAKER_10]: eons and now are finally starting to catch
up with the knowledge scientifically,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is so Even having the ability to
catch up with the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like with education.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a separation of What's in a
like story knowledge becomes not valued in
[SPEAKER_09]: the same way in this modern time of
education when we can just say there's
[SPEAKER_09]: work there's places for education and
there's Places for science and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: extremely important and I would love to
see that both were valued equally We could
[SPEAKER_09]: be like here's the observationist family
group that have been doing it for a really
[SPEAKER_09]: long time This is what they're bringing to
the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the scientific aspect Here's all
they're bringing them together is the real
[SPEAKER_09]: strength, you know and not having full
spectrum judgment on one or the other just
[SPEAKER_09]: bring them together and just and and
seeing you know what makes sense because
[SPEAKER_09]: every situation is different every
person's different Having the ability to
[SPEAKER_09]: have different options.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think is our greatest Our greatest gift
right now is options.
[SPEAKER_10]: I Would say options and as you're
describing this I imagine hopefully maybe
[SPEAKER_10]: even within 10 years having schools where
kids are in these learning gardens and
[SPEAKER_10]: these educational gardens and they're
understanding how these beautiful plants
[SPEAKER_10]: are working biodynamically symbiotically
and then also being able to pair it up
[SPEAKER_10]: with Quantifiable research just to drive
that message home.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do see it coming and it is it is full
spectrum, which is really beautiful I
[SPEAKER_10]: think it's more of an integrative process
than than segregated for sure Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: thank you guys for doing the good work So
I wanted to bring the conversation back to
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam Sam are you are you there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you with us still?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe But what I wanted to ask Sam When we
were here, but microphone keeps going off
[SPEAKER_06]: so I keep turning it back on oh That's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep meeting you because we're getting
echoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not meaning for me because I I have my
own mic with a switch that I use
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly Okay, so I don't need to mute
use what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't get to if you're so motivated
Well, I don't want to keep you out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation I'm more just trying to keep
echo feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: But alright, but anyway what I want to ask
you is let's go back to the discussion on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis or THC as a wreck and You were
bringing up the interesting story of
[SPEAKER_04]: trying pure THC with different terpenes
and I'm curious what your experience was
[SPEAKER_04]: like so obviously you tried THC and
limonene and THC and linalool and THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: all these other different terpenes so from
your perspective and how it made you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think With THC what terpenes do you
think had the best?
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational feel like what There is no
best recreational terpene and THC
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody has a different preference,
but everybody that we tested we blind
[SPEAKER_06]: tested we we had a hundred question
organoleptic survey before and after and
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody agreed that the terpenes have
these effects which ones they preferred
[SPEAKER_06]: was really up to the individual So what
did you prefer?
[SPEAKER_06]: I?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like limonene mercy in a small amount
Small amounts of pining seem to be okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I like both the same modulate and
Potentiate and there's only a sample that
[SPEAKER_06]: potentiate THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many that modulate it
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but listen to what I'm telling you
I'm dyslexic I will say the same word
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong Time after time after time We know
what you mean, it's okay You know what
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene is to Sam limonene is to the rest
of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly It's probably the one I I
enjoyed the most with but I also agree you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't necessarily want a variety with one
terpene and THC That's very useful for you
[SPEAKER_06]: To determine the effects of it,
but you want the sweet of terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: you enjoy Sam if you're really thirsty and
you come off of a I don't know some
[SPEAKER_01]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a walk on a hot day through New
York City and you come up to a a smoothie
[SPEAKER_01]: vendor that has all different kinds of
fruits and flavors What kind of smoothie
[SPEAKER_01]: would you get would you get an orange?
[SPEAKER_06]: or a tangerine smoothie Well orange
smoothies have always been my favorite,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'd usually have it with orange banana
and a few more things thrown in Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: guess what orange has a lot of Go ahead
you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear you say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's it's got limonene or whatever
it whether I'm saying it But it also has
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the other Near a doll and some of
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely does I'm just just pulling
on your leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm used to myself And so we so for a fact
you said you liked limonene or limelene,
[SPEAKER_04]: however, you want to say it What was your
favorite smell when I smelt single notes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually the most surprised by
mercy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting it to have more of Like a
skanky smell, but it was actually really
[SPEAKER_04]: like fruity and soft I guess because it's
high and And sorry hops hops can contain
[SPEAKER_04]: about 50% mercy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was expecting it to have that smell Some
people really like the smell of mercy and
[SPEAKER_06]: they also really like the effects of it
with THC it's not my favorite cup of tea
[SPEAKER_06]: because in small amounts it it potentiates
THC but in large Amounts it makes you in
[SPEAKER_06]: other words in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a stimulant in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a couch lock Never trust
anyone interesting Yeah, that was our our
[SPEAKER_10]: joke mercy lovers I remember I was gonna
say just on the note of mercy and I
[SPEAKER_10]: remember somewhere in the ethers of my
education long ago something around the
[SPEAKER_10]: the idea that any Anything less than 0.5
percent nursing will give that Uplifting
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of quality and anything over 1% will
actually bring you down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone have any science?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that to some degree but you can't
just pick a number like that and
[SPEAKER_06]: arbitrarily say it with everybody and you
can't say it because there is no variety
[SPEAKER_06]: that only has 0.5 mercy or whatever level
of mercy without the other cannabinoids Of
[SPEAKER_10]: course, of course, it was just something
that I remember learning through the
[SPEAKER_10]: Medical Cannabis Institute years ago Just
wondering if anyone had any extra insight
[SPEAKER_04]: on that piece Well, it sounds similar to
what Sam was just saying in that low
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts have one effect whereas high
amounts have another effect So it's a bi
[SPEAKER_04]: phasic and I think a lot of different
Compounds and cannabis have bi phasic
[SPEAKER_04]: effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets complicated trying to give
specific dosing requirements for people
[SPEAKER_04]: and that and of course, we're all very
individualistic and how we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: respond not even if you're a novel or an
advanced user, but if Smoked mercy and THC
[SPEAKER_06]: mixed and They their eyes just like melted
with joy But that's what they said.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I love and I says I can't
stand it Anytime you're anytime you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at just one terpene, I mean you're
again missing The the orchestra by just
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing one of the instruments in the
orchestra, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole number of different things
that are playing To the human senses in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that doesn't have to do With just
the first violin but has to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire string section combined with the
brass section all of those background
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and very very very, you know
minor forms and again, I look at Mercy is
[SPEAKER_01]: being somewhat of the maybe I won't call
it a stem cell terpene, but it's some it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a terpene that could actually is a bridge
to a lot of other more advanced terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpene alcohols and terpene oids and
and so again that Paper that we keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: referencing around has she sheen showed a
plausible mechanism for the photolithic
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation Of of mercy to make this new
terpene called has she sheen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there might be a whole Host of
every time you combine mercy with another
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene you have the opportunity for a
synergistic Ensemble effect and now when
[SPEAKER_01]: you put Four terpenes together five
terpenes six terpenes the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes that are available in the plant
You're you're creating the music Of an
[SPEAKER_01]: orchestra not of just a single instrument
in the orchestra So that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a symphony really and exactly if you
just pull out that one little symphony It
[SPEAKER_10]: is the chemical symphony and that's where
we're talking about that full spectrum
[SPEAKER_10]: Effect it is and just as like a little
insight Just I know with people that are
[SPEAKER_10]: using aromatherapies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways when they're doing combinations it
is like music it's like notes in a song
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's Harmonics and those smells
harmonize with each other or they clash So
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to actually pair up the idea of
terpenes with music in another way of just
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing it That is an excellent point
Selena And that's how I always teach
[SPEAKER_04]: people even if you're new to essential
oils And you want to make even just a
[SPEAKER_04]: basic perfume You need to think of how
you're building it like you're making
[SPEAKER_04]: music and you're building a chord and
similar to music You can hear a chord or
[SPEAKER_04]: music and it just sounds right it feels
right or if you feel like a note is off It
[SPEAKER_04]: feels kind of like and it just gives you a
weird feeling when you smell and create
[SPEAKER_04]: blends like that It's the same thing when
you have it properly balanced and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting all those notes And so I like to
break it down into three notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your base note your mid note and
your top note so for instance in my little
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaporizer guy back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you what my stash is today,
but I can tell you what I have going for
[SPEAKER_04]: aromatherapy So I have basically I created
a chord we can say out of three aromas so
[SPEAKER_04]: I use A base blend with a little bit of
patchouli and so that's considered a base
[SPEAKER_04]: blend Because it's heavier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slower to evaporate and that the
aroma comes up later Whereas a mid note is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be more balancing and kind of
bring it all together So I used a lavender
[SPEAKER_04]: as my mid note and then the top note hits
the fastest It's mostly composed of mono
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes such as limonene menthol things
that hit and absorb and that really potent
[SPEAKER_04]: smell that comes off really fast Those are
the top notes so today I have a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of peppermint which is nice in the morning
because it wakes me up So when you
[SPEAKER_04]: properly combine those three essential
oils or plant oils these are steam
[SPEAKER_04]: distilled plants I'm using today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You create this Chord basically that is
like Selena was saying like music and when
[SPEAKER_04]: you smell it it smells balanced versus one
of those single compounds alone and when
[SPEAKER_04]: you look at even just an essential oil,
that's the full plant so like Something
[SPEAKER_04]: like sweet orange essential oil might be
97% Limonene, but it has all these other
[SPEAKER_04]: little minute compounds a little bit of
mercy and a little bit of linalool just
[SPEAKER_04]: very very small amounts, but together they
create this like unique aroma that is
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet orange whereas something like Lemon
also has a really high amount of limonene,
[SPEAKER_04]: but because of the little minute amounts
of other terpenes and other compounds It
[SPEAKER_04]: smells very different than orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's very relatable to music and
I find it it's easier for people to learn
[SPEAKER_04]: and Absorb that knowledge when they can
relate it to music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for bringing that up Selena I
like the smell of limes the best of the
[SPEAKER_04]: citrus My personal favorite is Neroli
blossom so that's the orange blossom It's
[SPEAKER_04]: very expensive, but oh my goodness once
you smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those things you're
like I must have this in my life at all
[SPEAKER_04]: Times because it has the little bits of
like sweet orange that really nice fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: smell But then it also has these really
strong floral notes that come in and if
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get the right Neroli blossom It is
heaven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seriously one of the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that you gifted me is my favorite
smell at the moment Honestly, I've never
[SPEAKER_10]: smelled anything like it I thought you
know the lime that really orange that
[SPEAKER_10]: sweet orange citrus was mine But the
Neroli just takes it to a whole other
[SPEAKER_10]: level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that It's not only like
good it's it's like Seductive it is it's
[SPEAKER_04]: sensual.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, whoa, you smell like this
beautiful like flower That's like open is
[SPEAKER_10]: just like at its peak, you know,
it's so gorgeous, but it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: overpowering It's no it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Did you see the poster at the last
ICRS presentation by Ethan Russo and Mark
[SPEAKER_04]: Lewis Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you like that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, they're they're doing some
phenomenal work and Ryan can talk a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit If I'm correct Ethan just helped write
it up correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely Yeah, yeah, Ethan
presented was helping present it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's absolutely Mark Lewis's
work And so yeah, it's a nice I got the
[SPEAKER_04]: overview from both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know you guys talked about it a
little bit on a previous episode but
[SPEAKER_04]: basically what they do is they're Making
plants cultivars with specific terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: ratios.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the one that was really interesting
that they are most people were really
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in was this Particular cultivar
they had bred to be specific for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it also had high linalool in it and
I can't remember what other terpenes that
[SPEAKER_04]: they were bringing up Yes beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have more to say about that Ryan?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what I can say about it It
was the whole it was the whole team at
[SPEAKER_07]: Napero that did the work and that was for
one of their clients It actually wasn't
[SPEAKER_07]: Napero that was breeding the plants,
but they guide the they guide the science
[SPEAKER_07]: there They guide their clients through the
science So because Napero is a service
[SPEAKER_07]: laboratory, so they're not actually
growing the plants But yeah, it's
[SPEAKER_07]: fantastic work it's There the Napero folks
are doing some really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the poster so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up in my living room wall One and a
half meters by two meters well for I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's this this is the It's the
same kind of it's the extension of the
[SPEAKER_07]: work that you started so long ago really
Sam That maybe that's why I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's you know, it's very
very simpatico and I you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we got to give Credit to the founding
fathers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think without your work and your
teachings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think a lot of the Napero work
even would be where it is, but You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, I'm glad I think Giants,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we all stand on Giants and I'm glad
they picked up the torch Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: they really have taken to the next level
though, there's some There's some more
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting things that are coming in the
pipeline So maybe we'll see that at next
[SPEAKER_02]: year's ICRS Yeah, we wanted to agree with
Ryan as well Sam Thank you so much for you
[SPEAKER_02]: know your foundation and getting us to
this point was probably a lot of rocky
[SPEAKER_02]: roads a lot of dark closets a lot of black
market industry Thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing it forward for all of us to learn
from Well Sam showed us that you can you
[SPEAKER_07]: can breach the The the legal side from the
dark side, you know, I mean but that is
[SPEAKER_07]: the future of cannabis is legal and
Everybody's got to be willing to be
[SPEAKER_07]: changed over You can't you can't keep
doing the same old things that everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: learned in the in the last 20 years
Everybody's got to you know come into the
[SPEAKER_10]: light as it were Well, thank you Sam for
illuminating that path Because I feel like
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of us wouldn't be here doing the
work that we're doing if it wasn't for you
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for pioneering through the dark
times and being the crazy one I'm sure to
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of people and finally as my goal 30
years ago was to bring science on to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and to bring cannabis back into
Western mainstream medicine and We've done
[SPEAKER_06]: it a lot And some of the companies are not
particularly loved that are leading the
[SPEAKER_06]: path like GW pharmaceuticals But they
allowed everybody to approach this with a
[SPEAKER_06]: science Proof that this is working And now
we actually get to have the conversations
[SPEAKER_10]: around it with some quantifiable evidence
and move forward which is huge So one of
[SPEAKER_10]: the things that I think people need to
recognize is in order for that research to
[SPEAKER_10]: happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do need funding So at least we've had
some people including yourself You know be
[SPEAKER_10]: there for the right reasons of doing that
research so we could be here so we can
[SPEAKER_10]: talk to the mom so we can talk to the
Doctors so we can continue to move forward
[SPEAKER_10]: instead of be stuck in Legislation or just
you know not having the money to do the
[SPEAKER_06]: research cost so much is Because when you
do research and development you research
[SPEAKER_06]: all these different ideas and issues and
what if you're lucky one out of ten comes
[SPEAKER_06]: to fruitation and leads to a path that is
economically viable so you have to spend
[SPEAKER_06]: so much money to get to that point that
you have no comprehension I've spent
[SPEAKER_06]: millions and millions and millions and and
I I didn't make that much in the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent it
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you Yeah, thank you Sam also for
still coming out every Sunday and also on
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd's new show every Saturday and
spreading your knowledge It's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important to carry this conversation on
and we really appreciate you Spending time
[SPEAKER_04]: with us and teaching us and listening to
us also and yeah It's it's it's an honor
[SPEAKER_04]: to be on the panel with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's more and more educated
cannabis folks and we all can learn from
[SPEAKER_06]: each other and Some issues I was first but
There's plenty of other issues where I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: just as amazed as all of you when I hear
about it That's the beauty of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_10]: and of itself is it's bridging it's it's
making those connections It's sharing that
[SPEAKER_10]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminds me in a way of like mycelium,
you know, it's this beautiful Network and
[SPEAKER_10]: we're at this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all reconnecting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really cool
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Marcus now that we need him?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on island time we don't we don't have
a Marcus but we have a mark Can I ask you
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam what was like one of the craziest
things that you've seen in your career On
[SPEAKER_06]: what aspect I've seen too many crazy
things in my life I see people jumping out
[SPEAKER_06]: of windows When somebody knocked on the
door, they just jumped right out the
[SPEAKER_06]: window.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: When was this and why the 60s because the
60s cannabis was fairly serious if the
[SPEAKER_06]: federal if the police came to your
Facility, but not facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean your home where you lived and found
cannabis they could basically trash your
[SPEAKER_06]: entire house all your property and your
Your persona also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god I Just it blows my minds It's
just such a contrast to what I feel is
[SPEAKER_10]: like right and now it's I just feel those
people must feel like such idiots for It's
[SPEAKER_10]: just misinformation like it just blows our
mind I think they were doing what was
[SPEAKER_06]: Perceived in their minds as their jobs,
which was you know stopping dangerous
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotics and cannabis was Officially one
of those yeah, I mean in the media anyways
[SPEAKER_10]: In your experience when was that turning
point like what shifted what started to
[SPEAKER_10]: bring that back?
[SPEAKER_06]: around to maybe we should read really look
the Medicalization of cannabis to to
[SPEAKER_06]: really change and also industrial helped
help to a lesser degree but once people
[SPEAKER_06]: Were and children were sick and being
helped by cannabis You just couldn't keep
[SPEAKER_06]: it down anymore It was you know,
but the whole war on cannabis took a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of issues to end I mean and Things
to make it impossible for the authorities
[SPEAKER_06]: to win number one might have been
artificial lights That made it impossible
[SPEAKER_06]: for the authorities to stop all cannabis
production The other thing might have been
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds and clones once clones were able to
be passed around Then you could grow the
[SPEAKER_06]: best of the best instead of just an
average version of cannabis and that made
[SPEAKER_06]: a big difference also, so You know clones
seeds Artificial lights made it so that
[SPEAKER_06]: the war on cannabis was impossible to win
But it still took another 30 35 40 years
[SPEAKER_02]: for them to really admit that I Have a
question that you know is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm looking into Historically
and also, you know at at the crossroads
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are at kev cannabis And we were
talking about bridging earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm just wondering how we can now that
it's coming into legalization and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational as a namesake You know,
there is going to be more funding that's
[SPEAKER_02]: put into science There is going to be more
isolates that are being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be able to look at it in a
really different way how can we bridge the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of You know people that have
been working with this plant for 40 years
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of their observational techniques
as well as their growing practices and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they've learned and then bridge it
with modern science it seems to me that in
[SPEAKER_02]: history, you know with health of humans or
or or and in modern medicine there just
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to be more of a separation of These
things, you know, there's the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: version and then there's oh that other,
you know ideology of traditional and I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like we have a wonderful opportunity
right now with cannabis to bridge those
[SPEAKER_02]: two and I'm just wondering how we're going
to be able to move forward because this
[SPEAKER_02]: this whole conversation is really is about
you know bridging Modern science with with
[SPEAKER_02]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah how How is that going to happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really exactly sure how to answer
a question like that because I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis has been used modestly for
thousands of years and I'm not exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean modern science also does is confirm
what we've been saying over and over and I
[SPEAKER_06]: believe I'm a ardent believer in modern
science, but it's it's really nice when
[SPEAKER_06]: they're able to prove what we've already
already known for me for 50 years and for
[SPEAKER_06]: many others for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I Think it just in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it really comes down to having
those conversations person-to-person So
[SPEAKER_10]: being brave enough to have that discussion
in the first place I think that's what
[SPEAKER_10]: breaks taboo and I also think it's what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Really just I don't like the term
normalizes, but at least makes it More
[SPEAKER_10]: acceptable so the more we hear about it,
you know, we're hearing about it in the
[SPEAKER_10]: media now a lot We're hearing about it
from people that are advocating We're also
[SPEAKER_10]: hearing about it from people like
Hillary's grandma, you know who's just had
[SPEAKER_10]: such an incredible experience with it that
she can't help but share and in just my
[SPEAKER_10]: humble opinion, I think That's really
what's gonna make the difference and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what's going to bridge those worlds
is continually talking about it engaging
[SPEAKER_10]: in that discourse exposing yourself in
ways just to be that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I I sound so cliche at this point,
but really like be the change be the
[SPEAKER_10]: person that Doesn't look like your your
stigmatized stoner that can have an
[SPEAKER_10]: intellectual conversation including
research alongside some beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: anecdotal evidence And some stories I find
that that's been the best Game-changer for
[SPEAKER_10]: me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's gotten me out of being arrested.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Just having that conversation talking
about my grandma for example with one of
[SPEAKER_10]: the local police officers were literally
handcuffed on the side of the road on
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanksgiving three years ago and The one
cop was like totally not feeling it and
[SPEAKER_10]: the other one we started talking about my
grandma I started talking about how I'm a
[SPEAKER_10]: medical patient that they can look at my
dispensary cards.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got my I've got a digital Endorsement
from a doctor and once we started talking
[SPEAKER_10]: about it I realized that not only are you
know authorities misinformed, but if they
[SPEAKER_10]: don't necessarily seek Understanding the
law themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not laid out for them in plain
language So being that person that doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: you know that doesn't fit that stigma
being able to carry through that
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation I think that's what shifts
Cultures and that's what what bridges
[SPEAKER_10]: worlds?
[SPEAKER_09]: The elders and Younger people and and are
getting some of the most amazing results.
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like sometimes I mean We've you
know seen youths that have epilepsy Have
[SPEAKER_09]: that I've done everything met that medical
system has to offer for their whole entire
[SPEAKER_09]: life and literally one day after taking
But you know some oils or things that
[SPEAKER_09]: we've made they're just completely
different and then stay gone for so long
[SPEAKER_09]: and Maybe it's I don't know they maybe
they're more You know open or something,
[SPEAKER_09]: but there's there's amazing results.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what propels us forward
More than anything is results when it
[SPEAKER_09]: comes to you know health and well-being
Mm-hmm, and yeah, and it will be nice if
[SPEAKER_02]: science You know is able to take those
results that so many people have been
[SPEAKER_02]: working with cannabis You know in the
black market for so long You know it would
[SPEAKER_02]: be nice if those results were able to come
forward, and I guess you know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: were talking about You know continue
talking to one another I just think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really important because I have a lot
of friends who have been working with
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates of cannabis for a really long
time you know 40 years and Their results
[SPEAKER_02]: and what they're doing is is really
amazing But maybe their stories are never
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be heard because science is like
oh, we got it from here You know we're
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it from here And that's a little
bit of my concern because then that isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the plant as a holistic view
and what we're learning from it that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just isolating yet another part of it and
And I think that you know having these
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations is imperative to you know
the the future of the plant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity of the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my biggest fear tobacco is a master
plant used it by shamans all over the
[SPEAKER_09]: world for spiritual awakenings But most of
the tobacco that we've been exposed to
[SPEAKER_09]: here is just crap with chemicals in it so
I think that's the biggest part of What
[SPEAKER_09]: we've been doing is not only you know
looking at the science of the finished
[SPEAKER_09]: product, but also What goes into it
because there's a huge impact?
[SPEAKER_09]: That goes into the production of the
medicine so what we've been working on in
[SPEAKER_09]: a huge way and all this expansion is to
keep What you know if you've ever looked
[SPEAKER_09]: at the map that you make like if you have
a product here and every little piece that
[SPEAKER_09]: comes off all the Embedded energy that
goes into that we're taking on the
[SPEAKER_09]: production of it and that production of it
goes from the farm and it starts even
[SPEAKER_09]: before the farm and the inputs and we're
utilizing this this moment of expansion to
[SPEAKER_09]: You know Clean our earth at the same time
is because the purpose of growing the
[SPEAKER_09]: ganja stick to heal the human But the
human can't be healthy without a healthy
[SPEAKER_09]: environment, so it just it's a full circle
flower of life spectrum like look at it so
[SPEAKER_09]: we can't we talk about all aspects of it
and We're feeling pretty blessed and lucky
[SPEAKER_09]: right now that a lot of farmers and
production farms recreational or medicinal
[SPEAKER_09]: are Really really interested in producing
it from an ecological standpoint and also
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's interesting We talk a lot
and the conversation has been a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: you know how healthy cannabis is but often
we're not talking about how to make
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy cannabis and You know cannabis is
only as healthy as it's grown so yes Lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of its cannabinoids and what they all do,
but if they're not grown in a healthy
[SPEAKER_09]: manner Then they're just simply not
healthy for us Equals out the potency of
[SPEAKER_09]: it if the potency is all Spectrums are
building in the life and health of our
[SPEAKER_09]: environment and our well-being then that's
the that's the goal So if we have to look
[SPEAKER_09]: at the goal the goal isn't to flush
everything out to make it clean enough to
[SPEAKER_09]: make it To where we can ingest it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it's done and If it's done there it
is it's done, but I don't see it as a goal
[SPEAKER_09]: I see because then where is it flushed to
and then what's the life after that?
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know because you can say you do
know but anyway having a you know the the
[SPEAKER_09]: natural process all the way through is Is
really really crucial, and I think it
[SPEAKER_10]: takes a voice to bring people's awareness
to it Totally one note on that just as a
[SPEAKER_10]: reflection Also the health of the person
that's growing the plant you know if we
[SPEAKER_10]: have Someone that is candida ridden I can
imagine that their plants might have mold
[SPEAKER_10]: issues for example.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like there's this It's a it's a
resonant vibration, and it's also you know
[SPEAKER_10]: it's a it's an environmental mirroring so
I feel like also you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_10]: that if you're growing you're healthy from
the inside out part of the problem of the
[SPEAKER_09]: chronic disease that we're in at this
moment is the transformation of our food
[SPEAKER_09]: and the transformation of our seed away
from its original Yeah, away from its
[SPEAKER_09]: original Setting wheat that was eaten in
some area or the the fertile depressant is
[SPEAKER_09]: not the same as it is now you know so and
in the course of that change in that
[SPEAKER_09]: hybridization some of it was natural and
really positive, but other parts of it
[SPEAKER_09]: have affected our ability to process it
which is led into autoimmune diseases and
[SPEAKER_09]: what we're looking at now is how to repair
that you know how to To move away from
[SPEAKER_09]: that that cycle, and I think the best way
to do it is to just Stay as far away from
[SPEAKER_09]: it as possible in the production of
everything that we're doing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we always say seed to seed a lot of
people say seed to sale But I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really important that it's seed to
seed because we can talk about healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis and that you know or we can talk
about how healthy cannabis is for you But
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important to talk about healthy
cannabis as well because you know we can
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate a wheat grain and we can say all
these wonderful things that You know this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular wheat grain has for you But
we're not at all looking at the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: the wheat grain was grown and also and
that's important some of the inputs that
[SPEAKER_09]: have gone into the soils that we now use
those inputs are different and now it's
[SPEAKER_09]: affecting our soil microbiology and its
ability to process nutrients Which is just
[SPEAKER_09]: a challenge so you have to be able to get
soil testing to be able to know if your
[SPEAKER_09]: inputs are working properly and You know
that's a lab in itself too, so there's
[SPEAKER_09]: soil labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's cannabis turpentine labs It turns
into like a lot of labs all of a sudden to
[SPEAKER_09]: back what you already know really yeah in
this modern way of you know of
[SPEAKER_09]: scrutinization of medicine, I mean Food
would be affected greatly if they had to
[SPEAKER_06]: get laboratory tested in this way Well we
we never did our own soil testing we sent
[SPEAKER_06]: that out to a professional ag lab here in
the Netherlands, but I've always tested my
[SPEAKER_06]: soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always tested my water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always tested my this was either for
organic burning farming or for cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation and I really believe in the
science of cannabis and Gas chromatography
[SPEAKER_06]: and HPLC analytical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that is the foundation of modern
cannabis and its medicines I'm excited now
[SPEAKER_10]: that both worlds are being recognized as
valid and Yeah, again, but the bridge has
[SPEAKER_10]: happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so Inspiring it's so exciting to be
here at this time and be a part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally agree We think that it's you
know it's it's a wonderful time to be
[SPEAKER_02]: alive for cannabis And I feel like the
most important thing that you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: personally can offer because we can only
really talk you know from our from
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves is that you know I can offer a
voice for maybe she would like to be
[SPEAKER_02]: represented and and she meaning that you
know primarily You know it's a feminine
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of flip plant that we're using and
the energy of the plant is feminine but
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, and I think that if we each Go out
into the world and are a good voice for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant Then it's going to move this
plant forward in a way that you know it
[SPEAKER_06]: needs to go I'm in favor of cannabis
normalization then and I presume that
[SPEAKER_06]: means to be taxed or regulated by the
government if you're involved in the sale
[SPEAKER_06]: of it and Whether that be for medicinal or
recreational purposes, but I also Have
[SPEAKER_06]: been around long enough to realize that if
you look out who owns the world it's
[SPEAKER_06]: mostly bankers and lawyers that own all of
the big businesses out there and I presume
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll be with cannabis too, but As long as
it's legal for the rest of us to boutique
[SPEAKER_06]: it if you want to sell small amounts or
large amounts Whatever and do it in in a
[SPEAKER_06]: way that we care about like crap Beer or
something like that then I I'm in favor of
[SPEAKER_06]: it and also for people if they want to
grow their own personal use They should
[SPEAKER_06]: just be left alone if they want to sell it
then it should be taxed or regulated So
[SPEAKER_04]: that was a nice Conversation we were all
having here, but I just want to jump in
[SPEAKER_04]: with the question from the chat someone
was asking if we had any experience
[SPEAKER_04]: working with cannabis and pets and Selena
you had mentioned last week that you did
[SPEAKER_04]: some work with cannabis and horses Did you
want to talk a little bit about that and
[SPEAKER_04]: whoever else has some experience they want
to share?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd be honored so we had one horse
that we worked with and We worked with her
[SPEAKER_10]: owner This horse had actually had an
unfortunate accident where she got her leg
[SPEAKER_10]: caught in a fence and had a Wound that
wasn't healing They had a vet come along
[SPEAKER_10]: They made some suggestions They also saw
us that we can add a wellness expo So we
[SPEAKER_10]: have this really beautiful salve that is
great for open wound care And we suggested
[SPEAKER_10]: that they use it it contains frankincense
myrrh and lavender you make sure that we
[SPEAKER_10]: use grape seed oil as our base oil because
it's animal and pet friendly and Yeah from
[SPEAKER_10]: the feedback that we got healed up
beautifully and No qualms the one
[SPEAKER_10]: suggestion that we owe Always have
especially with wound care and animals in
[SPEAKER_10]: general especially dogs Is you want to put
that salve on the wound and then take that
[SPEAKER_10]: dog for a walk?
[SPEAKER_10]: So make sure that you're getting them to
be active right after otherwise They're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna start looking at the wound and
because it does contain THC and
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids that can be potentially
psychoactive we want to be mindful of that
[SPEAKER_10]: so you can use it as a spray as Salve we
use drops primarily one of the Things that
[SPEAKER_10]: we have formulated is a micro dose drop so
we can accurately dose our I believe our
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD drops are like point six six
milligrams of CBD per drop our THC ones
[SPEAKER_10]: are point eight two So we're able to
really accurately dose low dose and work
[SPEAKER_10]: out from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've helped animals from anything from
arthritic pain to seizures to end-of-life
[SPEAKER_10]: care to helping in treating and being a
companion Healer in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_10]: cancers some successful some not it's in
the in the fact that the We had this
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just gonna tell the story is that
okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that cool if I just tell the story?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so There is this really beautiful
dog that we were helping and He had a type
[SPEAKER_10]: of cancer that started to just really
affect all of the soft tissue his owner
[SPEAKER_10]: very heart center did everything she
possibly could to save her beautiful dog
[SPEAKER_10]: friends and It was interesting because he
had gone through some very invasive
[SPEAKER_10]: surgeries where they had literally removed
all of the tissue except for the ligament
[SPEAKER_10]: and muscle so this dog had a lot of
healing to do and So loved so loved by his
[SPEAKER_10]: guardian, and I she's just such a sweet
person to my heart what ended up happening
[SPEAKER_10]: was he was able to recover to a certain
extent and The disease was progressing,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it was it wasn't as fast It wasn't as
rapid what we were using at that point was
[SPEAKER_10]: a one-to-one synergy oil so an even ratio
of THC to CBD and we were beginning to
[SPEAKER_10]: ramp up and what we were noticing is that
this dog was beginning to Get his appetite
[SPEAKER_10]: back more playful again that spark was
coming back which was really exciting with
[SPEAKER_10]: this particular type of cancer that he had
There was also a chance of heart failure,
[SPEAKER_10]: so we had instructed his guardian I don't
call animal owners.
[SPEAKER_10]: I call them guardians his guardian had
decided to go with a raw food diet just
[SPEAKER_10]: lightly cooked and we were using a flora
to support the prevention of this now it
[SPEAKER_10]: was something that Stephen my colleague
his mother she's She's fascinating long in
[SPEAKER_10]: the short Of it she was able to guide us
in that she had had the same experience
[SPEAKER_10]: with her dog And she had given us the
warning on this She also works as a blood
[SPEAKER_10]: technician at an animal blood bank So she
has a lot of experience firsthand with
[SPEAKER_10]: sick animals and helping get them better
But what ended up happening was this
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful dog got to a certain state of
health where he was happy-go-lucky and
[SPEAKER_10]: really excitable and they were on one of
their regular walks, and he spotted a deer
[SPEAKER_10]: and he started chasing the deer and He
ended up going into cardiac arrest and she
[SPEAKER_10]: heard him down Just just down the gully
and she ran to him and he was having a
[SPEAKER_10]: heart attack and ended up passing in her
arms But the feedback that we got was that
[SPEAKER_10]: she was so grateful That he had been able
to maintain a state of health where his
[SPEAKER_10]: quality of life was so good that he was
able to Really enjoy those last moments of
[SPEAKER_10]: his life doing exactly what he had loved
to do and he hadn't chased A deer for
[SPEAKER_10]: months.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was like a really big deal So as
hard as it was for her It was also such a
[SPEAKER_10]: blessing for her to have cannabis as one
of those allies to help make things a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit easier And I can say this to
you cannabis also helped her go through
[SPEAKER_10]: that experience as a caregiver and as a
guardian Watching someone she loved so
[SPEAKER_10]: dearly and still does Go through such a an
invasive experience before he passed But
[SPEAKER_10]: what I've seen is that cannabis can be
applied in so many different ways for
[SPEAKER_10]: animals And because animals don't have
these precognitions of this is this devil
[SPEAKER_10]: drug Or this evil plant or it's gonna make
me high or whatever They seem to respond
[SPEAKER_10]: in my experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways better to the medicine So so it's
it's uh for us it's been a really
[SPEAKER_10]: beautiful experience and we've been able
to help dogs cats With anxiety issues with
[SPEAKER_10]: so many different things, especially
animals that unfortunately have been you
[SPEAKER_10]: know have been subjected to traumatic
experiences that can help with that as
[SPEAKER_10]: well just to alleviate that anxiety and
those symptoms of You know where where
[SPEAKER_10]: they kind of lose control or they can
become aggressive We've had experience
[SPEAKER_10]: actually with my mom She has two dogs that
both have epilepsy and we were able to
[SPEAKER_10]: help get the seizures under control
several a day down to One within a week of
[SPEAKER_10]: using a low dose one-to-one drop I think
we were at I would say well actually it
[SPEAKER_10]: was one milligram one of the dogs was a
boxer Gracie and the other one he's still
[SPEAKER_10]: with us Jager little Jager buddy He's a
little cocker spaniel, but Jager used to
[SPEAKER_10]: have seizures all day every day And it was
it was really hard and this was the
[SPEAKER_10]: difference and for him his quality of life
is much better his appetite of course has
[SPEAKER_10]: always been there but Even for Gracie,
you know, she ended up passing as a boxer
[SPEAKER_10]: who ended up going blind who?
[SPEAKER_10]: Really had a hard time with integrating
with other animals socially after that
[SPEAKER_10]: point because she was She she used to be
top dog and then mom got another dog who
[SPEAKER_10]: became the top dog a little Yippee your
little terrier So he was the top dog and
[SPEAKER_10]: it was interesting to see Gracie go
through that but I know for her especially
[SPEAKER_10]: at end of life it was She looked forward
to the dropper she could hear the little
[SPEAKER_10]: ding ding ding on the little bottle and
that was her kind of like signal to perk
[SPEAKER_10]: up and get her medicine and those drops on
her little cookie was was something that I
[SPEAKER_10]: know I mean the cookie was great,
but she recognized the drops for what it
[SPEAKER_10]: was.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty powerful With animals.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean you have to make sure that the
guardian is well educated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a trial and error I always
recommend that we pair it up with food
[SPEAKER_10]: being mindful of fats and Making sure that
we do Trial runs just like you would with
[SPEAKER_10]: with anybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually recommend that we start either
in the afternoon or after Dinner,
[SPEAKER_10]: so for example after six o'clock so you
can have a first drop, you know And we
[SPEAKER_10]: always microdose and then just witness for
the next 24 hours how that animal will
[SPEAKER_10]: respond Just like humans everybody's a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not a one-size-fits-all approach
So monitoring making notes Keeping on top
[SPEAKER_10]: of things tracking it is really important
Just so you can get an accurate dose for
[SPEAKER_10]: that animal and do them due diligence to
to be able to get the medicinal benefit
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're looking for Some animals can
absolutely get high.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the other thing to be mindful of
is If you are, you know If you are dosing
[SPEAKER_10]: your dog, for example, and they're a whole
market you're gonna play for us I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I thought I was muted.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting Stoked about you playing.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, I wanted to add something about
our dog our dog Floyd Who is our family
[SPEAKER_01]: pet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Suffered from some kind of allergic
response We don't exactly know we think it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a grass allergy because it really
became very prevalent during the warm
[SPEAKER_01]: summer months of last year and We've
looked up so many different treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: because basically what he was doing is
licking his paws so much just because of
[SPEAKER_01]: irritation from the Allergy that he would
basically lick his paws raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean lick the fur right off it and Like
just figuring to look at like this bloods
[SPEAKER_01]: Swollen paws and we had him on on a
medicine a new medicine that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: advertised quite a bit here in the states
called apiquil Apiquil is a sulfonamide
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack inhibitor jk inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Yeah, basically again, you're
treating the symptom and not treating the
[SPEAKER_01]: cause by just deadening chemically the
immune response of the animal by just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's basically like giving a
epilepsy patient benzodiazepines you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just treating the symptom ology of the of
the epileptic event and that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going after the underlying cause
so we were kind of beside ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: because we Saw all kinds of negative
effects about using this stuff called
[SPEAKER_01]: apiquil Which is readily prescribed now in
veterinary applications We decided to take
[SPEAKER_01]: him off of apiquil and just put him on a
CBD regimen of Took him off of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what else do we have him on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he no longer gets on spot flea
treatments which we we hear that one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the side effects of flea treatments You
know these very powerful insecticides that
[SPEAKER_01]: you put on your animals if they're in a
outdoor environment to protect them from
[SPEAKER_01]: From you know, very dangerous insects and
whatnot I mean a lot of those have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of whole laundry list of side effects and
we started seeing Shudders tremors he
[SPEAKER_01]: would just be sitting there and all sudden
he would just start shaking almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: like a like an epileptic seizure our
previous animal actually suffered from
[SPEAKER_01]: canine epilepsy and We spent a fortune in
the conventional canine, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Therapeutic way to try to figure things
out, but we're too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really try CBD earlier,
but here's the upside So the upside is
[SPEAKER_01]: that this summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD so the base solution that I start
with is about a thousand milligrams and 30
[SPEAKER_01]: mils of oil That's what sort of a base
solution to start Titrating your your pets
[SPEAKER_01]: dose and what we did is we just added it
to his dry kibble You know put a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: drops on and we kind of titrated him up to
what we have them on about six drops a day
[SPEAKER_01]: eight drops a day of that of that solution
and I'll post pictures up to my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just like night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see his paws.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter had saved The I freeze okay,
I might have Froze up for a second my
[SPEAKER_00]: pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has The pictures of his paws
after I think I froze again, but um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll post those and you could see for
yourself The condition that the animal is
[SPEAKER_01]: in now He he has no tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to get all kinds of Bumps almost
like I don't want to say acne,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just some kind of skin irritation from
his allergy We see none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see no yeast infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to get secondary staph infections
and yeast infections from licking his his
[SPEAKER_01]: his fur right off of his It would expose
his skins to start getting staph
[SPEAKER_01]: infections and that's a really key thing
is when you start smelling a different
[SPEAKER_01]: essence, especially coming from paws or
areas of open wounds You have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned with staph infections with with
animals, especially dogs because dogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know like to lick themselves and You
know, I mean there's Sometimes not the
[SPEAKER_01]: most sterile of environments, but it is
certainly just with our animal anyway a
[SPEAKER_01]: night and day I Mean, it's just it's just
like you could see it What do you look
[SPEAKER_01]: like last year and I'll post this pause
red raw from just licking and sensibly to
[SPEAKER_01]: now just having full skin or full hair and
No side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we feel that we're doing Selena is
we're we're boosting his own
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoid system to be his own
bodies pharmaceutical company,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there's an illogical Pathogen or
antigen response that it you know elicits
[SPEAKER_01]: a an immune response His body is fully
fortified with enough CBD to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: keep his body healthy and again I wanted
to say one other thing before because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think Natasha had mentioned this You know
every time you take any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids You're putting fascinates
into your body Oxidants or water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: things like ascorbate and vitamin C and
whatnot fat soluble Antioxidants are just
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you need to have in your diet
and consuming and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that prolonged cannabis use
provides a background of Antioxidants in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oedipus tissue and fatty structures like
the brain that help keep free radicals and
[SPEAKER_01]: Reactive oxygen species from causing all
kinds of Mutations and so yeah again like
[SPEAKER_01]: go back to the rec versus medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also been shown that Cannabis use
will protect your pancreas from undergoing
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxidative damage which can lead to all
kinds of conditions including cancer of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think David Allen said a bet
whether you understand it or not all
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use is medical because These
things are happening inside the tissues
[SPEAKER_01]: and inside the cellular mechanisms in your
body You're not even aware of it and while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're enjoying your your recreational
high and get wrecked with your friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything You know remember when you said
to your college roommate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's go kill some brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go smoke one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually ironically just doing the
opposite You're actually growing brain
[SPEAKER_01]: cells protecting your brain from oxidative
damage and other oxidative events that are
[SPEAKER_01]: very important to control In your body
because those oxidative things can be very
[SPEAKER_10]: damaging What about like eating versus
smoking versus vaporizing versus topical
[SPEAKER_10]: in your opinion versus insertion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean again the study show the the
the famous UCLA Tashkin study shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know cannabis users who smoke cannabis
have a lower Incident of lung disease than
[SPEAKER_01]: people who don't smoke anything at all So
that tells you that these molecules that
[SPEAKER_01]: were in Hailing into our lung have a
prophylactic effect to basically protect
[SPEAKER_01]: from some of the other environmental
onslaughts You get from breathing the air
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York City or walking behind a bus
that's spewing out all kinds of diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: fumes or we're constantly Assaulted with
carcinogenic materials all throughout our
[SPEAKER_01]: lifetime So it's a really in our benefit
to have in our daily consumption not only
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis but cats and antioxidants and
heart healthy molecules like the The
[SPEAKER_01]: polyunsaturated fatty acids and hemp seed
oil we've talked about quite a bit I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the kinds of things that are
going to help nourish your body and help
[SPEAKER_01]: your body fight these infections and not
some pill that you have to buy from
[SPEAKER_04]: company somewhere I totally agree mark and
even Eating like not just the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: plant but also the hemp seed plant And the
hemp seed oil and the hemp seed protein
[SPEAKER_04]: And even just fruits and vegetables and
mushrooms and all of these other
[SPEAKER_04]: complementary foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to access all of our nutrients
Joshua and Kelly did you guys have
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to add about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis and pets you guys said you had
some experience also Yeah, Maggie Liu.
[SPEAKER_02]: She lived to be I we think 17 and a half
and she was a black lab So probably
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere at 12 years old She started to
have Lots of tumors all over and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: treating them topically with my regular
You know our oil that we do because we
[SPEAKER_02]: make it into salves or we put it into the
dog food We put it in the raw dog food
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just part of our daily
nutrient It's not something that we
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize just for a you know, an ailment or
a malady You know, it's just something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's utilized every day and we started
noticing that Maggie Liu was getting More
[SPEAKER_02]: and more tumors and then I thought wow,
she seems like she's in pain So then I
[SPEAKER_02]: started to give her the CBD THC blend of
the half and half and She Sorry like
[SPEAKER_02]: something happened there and Within a
year, I just I just thought I was killing
[SPEAKER_02]: her pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought well, here's a dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's in pain I'm just killing her pain
until she passes You know, she's 12 year
[SPEAKER_02]: old big black lab, you know, she's had a
wonderful life.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's gonna pass We'll just try to make
her comfortable Well, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sort of giving her heroic doses of
it just to keep her down You know In the
[SPEAKER_02]: grass and keeping her just calm and
feeling good and she could still stand up
[SPEAKER_02]: and go pee and do what she needed to do So
she was getting heroic doses for about
[SPEAKER_02]: three months and probably on the third or
fourth month I noticed that the tumors
[SPEAKER_02]: were starting to shrink and by maybe this
eighth month all of the tumors were gone
[SPEAKER_02]: every single tumor in her entire body was
totally gone and You know, she did heroic
[SPEAKER_02]: doses for three months and that's just a
really interesting thing that we noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: and and Then she lived to be 17 and a half
and just died of old age with no tumors
[SPEAKER_01]: and zero pain What what's a heroic dose
just so we can put it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tablespoon of the CBD THC mix that we
have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean that's what we did we had We
would gauge, you know how much CBD we put
[SPEAKER_09]: in there because we have like a more of a
pure CBD strain that we made an extract
[SPEAKER_09]: out of and then we had a THC strain that
we made an extract of oil Extract out and
[SPEAKER_09]: we put the two together in order to make a
medicine that wouldn't knock her out too
[SPEAKER_02]: much Yeah, but but we didn't we can't
really tell you what the milligrams were
[SPEAKER_02]: because we didn't have the ability to test
it at that time but I can say that I
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize it for my migraines and I would
take a heroic dose which meant that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gone and out for 24 hours done just
Totally sleeping and gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was Giving her the same amount that I
was taking which was a full tablespoon Was
[SPEAKER_02]: she having the same effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, yeah, she would just be totally
asleep and out of it and in perfect She
[SPEAKER_10]: wasn't like she wasn't like a thergic or
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was really relaxed Just relaxed asleep
wanting to be outside in the grass feeling
[SPEAKER_09]: fantastic point where she has tumors on
her like we wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we dosed her up all the way up to like a
full tablespoon which I still was trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep it a one-to-one because I think
the ratio is very important, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think that talking about
milligrams and percentages is really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting, but I love the idea of You
know a balance a balance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids or a balance of the terpenes
or our balances because our body cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: Only uptake so much, you know at a certain
time So it was still a one-to-one ratio
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were giving her so we were upping
her CBD Tremendously as well at that time
[SPEAKER_09]: a teaspoon was a normal dose of our oil at
the time Yeah, so we were tripling it for
[SPEAKER_10]: her Were you guys like giving her because
I've played around with the dosing and
[SPEAKER_10]: we've done it where we've like put it on
blueberries and stuff to make sure that
[SPEAKER_10]: that animal can eat it was your dog just
like licking it off the spoon No,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Dogs don't really like to have
things on their paws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just put the oil on their paws,
then they always lick it off They don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like having anything on their paws They
like their paws clean and usually no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter how sick they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll still want to lick their paws So
we're making our own raw dog food now So
[SPEAKER_09]: now we can just put a little bit in the
raw dog food and they just eat it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for medicinal you can put it on the
paws and and if you make it a olive oil
[SPEAKER_02]: just put you touch a touch of olive oil,
even if you're doing like a Another
[SPEAKER_02]: extract of some sort, you know dogs love
olive oil And that was a medicinal
[SPEAKER_09]: mushroom cannabis oil too that we were
using so at that point it's just You know
[SPEAKER_09]: throw everything at it kind of like
Instead of the kitchen what's in it's the
[SPEAKER_09]: forest whatever is in the forest and on
our land and stuff So which turns out to
[SPEAKER_09]: be pretty darn medicinal in the end
because I mean the medicinal mushroom
[SPEAKER_09]: extracts on their own are a world to
themselves and to put the two together
[SPEAKER_09]: with Matt with with cannabis I mean,
we've had amazing results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we encourage other people micro
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like to master genres of medicine
coming together and there's 5,000 years of
[SPEAKER_09]: Medicinal mushroom knowledge in the
Chinese there's Russians and Japanese and
[SPEAKER_09]: Korean people at not people but medical
papers there's tons of you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: if we if we you know could read Japanese
or Korean or even Russian for that matter
[SPEAKER_09]: there is a ton of medicinal mushroom
studies on health and well-being and we
[SPEAKER_09]: can't read those but there's a lot we can
and so putting it together with Cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: is been an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah We think that it's a world that and
the dogs could all look at to it really
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking, you know Polypores polypore
medicine, but that's what we found There
[SPEAKER_04]: is this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, I just want to mention there
was a comment in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys power like when you're
Administering the cannabis are demeaned
[SPEAKER_04]: THC or THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you are you using raw stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you using D cards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a THC a at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oftentimes because we're just keeping
that temperature super super super low and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it goes on for probably about five to
seven days temperatures probably around a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred degrees Yeah, maybe a hundred and
ten at the most, you know at the very very
[SPEAKER_02]: highest there and then we Strain off that
and then we put more oil in there and then
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets decarboxylated with all of the
different mushrooms and everything in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and then that will be added as the
activated THC, you know the non acidic
[SPEAKER_02]: version so And then we also have the CBD
which you know is also slow cooked in with
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC a So just trying to add all of the
different versions of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's primarily low simmer cooked to keep
It more on the less active Are you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: doing any stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you mentioned a little bit before
with raw cannabis and juicing and even
[SPEAKER_04]: just do you ever Feed some of the leaves
or put that into pill form to ever work
[SPEAKER_02]: with that with your animals You know
cannabis is such an incredible You know
[SPEAKER_02]: fibrous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's really hard to digest in
raw form if you're not You know just to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe blend it up in a blender a lot of
people put it in caps and I just think
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's It just my own intuitive
Feeling feels like that's pretty harsh on
[SPEAKER_02]: the intestines unless you're doing some
type of a parasitical cleanse or something
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time Which might be nice for a
short version?
[SPEAKER_02]: Period but for longer term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that juicing is really wonderful
and we definitely Utilize that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: making teas is great You know that there's
so many ways to And to be able to start
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing that cannabis is a basic nutrient
that yeah, we're talking about it is like
[SPEAKER_02]: a medicine But you know the hemp sees this
is a basic nutrient that our DNA has not
[SPEAKER_02]: had for several generations because of you
know The interesting measures that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: put upon it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know as humans You know on the planet,
but now that we're starting to get it back
[SPEAKER_02]: into our bodies and our DNA we're starting
to research and Study it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the dogs like to chew on the
cannabis stocks Oh, yeah, always give them
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll rip them up until it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They play games with it So I just want to
change topics a little bit another
[SPEAKER_04]: question for Joshua and Kelly came up a
question from Martin Giles he wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: know how to increase phosphorus and
potassium during flowering using organic
[SPEAKER_04]: practices if you had any tips or If you
could amend or had some yeah, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have something to add to that oh
for sure That's like our passion so you
[SPEAKER_02]: just can look at at phosphorus and
phosphorus is this Amazing thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from the soil, and it's easily found
in plants that have already uptaken it
[SPEAKER_02]: from the soil You know to take it from its
original form like a mineral or something
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it really hard to digest in the same
way that a supplement that you buy from
[SPEAKER_02]: you know A health food store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know maybe you're only digesting 10%
of that because it's a raw mineral,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if it's Found in plants already,
then it's easily uptakeable And that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: herbology is so important for our own
bodies to uptake nutrients as well as for
[SPEAKER_02]: plants So we can look at different plants
that have high phosphorus qualities And we
[SPEAKER_02]: always know that the highest amount of the
phosphorus in that plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: found in the root and in the seed so at
the very end of a life cycle of a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: its seeds and then it's taken all of the
phosphorus out of the plant and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to find out of the soil and
put it into the plant and you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: find a tremendous amount of phosphorus in
the plant from the plant in those seeds so
[SPEAKER_02]: when we study seeds You know cover crops
and things like that we realize that a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of phosphorus is found in seeds and
actually oddly enough one of the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds out there is the poppy seeds so you
can you can take poppy seeds and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: and also cannabis seeds super high in
phosphorus and you can blend them up in
[SPEAKER_02]: your blender and You can feed it to your
tea brew or to your soils to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake those nutrients Easily the plant
doesn't have to break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just readily available and the
microbiology is ready to eat it so Burdock
[SPEAKER_02]: is another one turkey rhubarb is another
one you can use Bracken fern Another thing
[SPEAKER_09]: so there's you can top dress that you can
utilize those wild weeds and compost You
[SPEAKER_09]: can make teas out of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like she's listing off a lot of the
things that we've just used We've used a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of ferns a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of bracken ferns all across
our property right now Burdock is an
[SPEAKER_09]: invasive species in the forest So there's
government contracts for people to go down
[SPEAKER_09]: and cut burdock down everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're using burdock Roots and high and
phosphorus turkey rhubarb is really easy
[SPEAKER_09]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a perennial it comes back every It
can be invasive in your garden You just
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in there and you can use it in all
of your teas for your gardens for
[SPEAKER_09]: phosphorus so easy Utilizing those roots
and teas so we're chopping them up and
[SPEAKER_09]: making a tea out of them to get used to
utilize an easy uptakeable tea Rock cacao
[SPEAKER_09]: is easy to get there's a high in magnesium
as every other nutrient in the world in
[SPEAKER_02]: rock cacao Amazing list and you only need
a tiny bit so you can put it in a tea brew
[SPEAKER_02]: and throw it on your plants and You can
get phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other question?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other nutrient?
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus and potassium Oh and potassium
Potassium is is super easy to to find in
[SPEAKER_02]: any flowering plants or that are yellow
Sunflowers have a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium and they've pulled it all up and
out of the soil There's lots of roots
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow potatoes are so easy to grow And you
can make potato mashes or ferments to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants and and it's immediately
uptakeable There's health if you're close
[SPEAKER_02]: to the ocean Although that's sketchy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah oceans pretty interesting Topic soils
accordingly So if you're making a soil
[SPEAKER_09]: think about adding roots and different
things like that to your soil if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing a soil blend If you have piece of
land then you're gonna try and accumulate
[SPEAKER_09]: those materials that you know are high in
phosphorus maybe it's your Bones that
[SPEAKER_09]: you've been eating or maybe there's bones
around that you can burn and stick those
[SPEAKER_09]: in your soil You can use your chicken
eggs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can save all your chicken shells and
put those in your soil over the house Top
[SPEAKER_09]: dressing if you have an outdoor situation
you just take those basic principles that
[SPEAKER_09]: we just gave you and you try and
accumulate the biomass in the soil if you
[SPEAKER_09]: can get it in the soil breaking down
composting that's your ultimate and then
[SPEAKER_09]: utilizing Fermented raw leaf teas or raw
root or raw seed teas in the summer is the
[SPEAKER_09]: way to liquefy those nutrients and put
them in on teas and it's free and you can
[SPEAKER_09]: you can Grow them yourself or you can
collect them from nature or really another
[SPEAKER_02]: easy thing if people are indoor growers
You know what we're all lacking and what
[SPEAKER_02]: soil is lacking and what cannabis plants
are lacking in health and well-being or
[SPEAKER_02]: trace minerals and you can grow an aloe
plant in your indoor garden or In your in
[SPEAKER_02]: your kitchen garden and you can add a ton
of trace minerals to it You know that have
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 trace minerals or 72 trace minerals in
it and then you can easily Take those aloe
[SPEAKER_02]: spears and then we could either drink it
or even add it to our plants and then all
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is getting it easily accessibly
through microbiology and soil It's all
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty easy super good high compost is the
number one basic A question that came up
[SPEAKER_04]: is when you're using the seeds you
mentioned Cannabis and poppy seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're putting it into your fertilizer or
how are you using the seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sprouting them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you like are you doing that first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just using the seeds as is someone
was wondering You can do either or if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna sprout them You just want to
sprout them up just a tiny bit so that the
[SPEAKER_02]: the phosphorus is still really high From
the seed you could blend the sprouts and
[SPEAKER_09]: use it make it into a liquefied tea If you
had a lot of seeds you could grind it up
[SPEAKER_09]: and use it as a top dress on your soil
Which would be really awesome and let the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots come up and eat it and it's easy to
find hemp seeds So you can just put them
[SPEAKER_02]: in a blender and top dress over your soil,
which is really nice to a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of different ways that you
can utilize seed nutrients seeds are such
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing way to get all of our You know
basic minerals because they have
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that they need to grow into a
really large plant at the at the beginning
[SPEAKER_09]: you can utilize your cover crop like green
manure and sprout it on the top and drop
[SPEAKER_09]: it, you know grow it like that big and
pull it off and drop it on your soil and
[SPEAKER_09]: let you know more microbiology on the top
layer your soil Eat and live off that so
[SPEAKER_09]: your cover crops that you sprout on the
top layer Of your soil are gonna have
[SPEAKER_09]: different nutrient mediums and nutrient
makeup So what you do is just look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: nutrient makeup of all the seeds that
you're sprouting and utilize those seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: in different cycles in order to feed that
into your soil because You know the plants
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna Get different things out of the soil
based off its own based off its cycle So
[SPEAKER_09]: if you can get in tune with the cycle and
what you're sprouting then using seeds as
[SPEAKER_09]: a cover or the deficiencies get into the
deficiencies of Also just teas you can put
[SPEAKER_09]: you know your seeds in teas and just
ferment them in water you know and utilize
[SPEAKER_09]: lactic acid bacteria or EM mother cultures
and It's an incredible large wormhole and
[SPEAKER_02]: ferment that question
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not interested in traditional
organics Lang Vanite and potash and
[SPEAKER_09]: sulfate of potash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't use those type of charged
minerals in our side Can you share why
[SPEAKER_09]: well because it's a the the practice of
gathering that out of a mine Alone is a
[SPEAKER_09]: problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean just the sulfate of potash Go to
one go to a mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like it takes two sides It's a really
hot terrible place to work with people
[SPEAKER_09]: with a bunch of lung infections running
around building scaffolding trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: clean, but it's crazy It's basically crazy
sauce and then you put that into your and
[SPEAKER_09]: then it's a charged element So it can be
organic it can be from the earth and stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: when it's charged up in your So which can
be left down there reacts with the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: that way, but what we're saying is and
even with Backguano, I mean there's a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of reasons why not to use backguano.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's the collection of the back
potato blade Maybe you know you realize as
[SPEAKER_09]: soon as they started putting backguano in
ships and putting them in ships with
[SPEAKER_09]: potatoes and bring them to Europe all of a
sudden million people died because this
[SPEAKER_09]: crazy blight happens and What she's
talking about microbiology, which is so
[SPEAKER_09]: important grows on different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what we want to do is just be like
we're food ganja up in the Beneficials,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know in our soil and it's not a bunch
of charged minerals for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to say Alright, we want the
things that are gonna react in a kind and
[SPEAKER_09]: gentle but yet really easily a simulable
and potent I mean you can see our
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram page in our different plants and
different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have giant plants We don't buy things
for our plants like our whole entire farm
[SPEAKER_09]: is Grown local soil that we've piled
together in different ways compost that
[SPEAKER_09]: we've made and Huge weed teas.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're growing weeds with weed weed weeds
It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And it's easier for the plant to
uptake So the idea is that you've got this
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful catalyst or or the middleman and
when you have a middleman of a plant It's
[SPEAKER_02]: already uptaken everything that it needs
from the soil to then be able to give your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or give you So why are we going to
this basic raw?
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral that we can't really uptake and
neither can the plan and it takes a really
[SPEAKER_02]: long time for the soil microbiology,
you know to break it down you can utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: plants as a as a catalyst for say
magnesium, you know as an example of you
[SPEAKER_02]: can grow your own tiny little alfalfa pot
you can give your alfalfa a tremendous
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of magnesium and that's a plant
that can uptake magnesium like in lots
[SPEAKER_02]: amount so then you can cut it three times
a year and Make a ferment out of it make a
[SPEAKER_02]: raw Brew out of it, but you know make a
top dress out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares what you do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just easy gardening and farming
you're not driving anywhere You're not
[SPEAKER_02]: having to do anything and people are able
to do this in indoor scenarios as well
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just for a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working with really large
indoor facilities to learn to grow their
[SPEAKER_02]: own nutrients and create Closed-loop
systems that are working and they're on
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, they're they're 10th run
And they're in large recreational indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and and they're having
tremendous You know growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities and health from you know,
what people thought was never possible And
[SPEAKER_09]: they're doing it cheaply along with
everyone in the pure certified family and
[SPEAKER_09]: the pure farmers that are doing all this
amazing work out there I mean we're
[SPEAKER_09]: providing Ways to grow indoors with soil
tests with lab tests everything proven to
[SPEAKER_09]: work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're utilizing natural outdoor systems
were utilizing them indoors and commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: settings and Utilizing in the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just a thing that can only
happen far away in the mountains It can
[SPEAKER_09]: happen indoor indoors as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean bone meal is another thing,
you know, you've got that's a crazy thing
[SPEAKER_09]: to put in your soil I mean, where does
that come from and really?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do you know blood meal?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should think about organic farms are
utilizing massive amounts of blood and
[SPEAKER_02]: bone meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you wouldn't believe The amounts
that organic farmers are utilizing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that are all certified organic
and and not only I mean you can think
[SPEAKER_02]: about what what is it like when I when a
steak sits out for You know a few hours as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to what an apple looks like when
it sits out for a few hours And the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference is between those smells,
you know meat and and things that are from
[SPEAKER_02]: animals are going to really draw they
become a prebiotic for pathogens as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to plants become a prebiotic for
more beneficials not that they can't be a
[SPEAKER_02]: prebiotic for for Pathogens, but that's
why you know It's so important that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to continuously add those
things into your soil that really you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not drawing a beneficial microbiology
symbiotic Relationship in your soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna help you long term where we
know we know that we're feeding microbes
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know that our microbes are feeding
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what microbes do we want to feed?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have to think about those
populations and phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_09]: are one of the harder things to access
when it comes to farming so that person
[SPEAKER_09]: who asked that question is asking a really
good question because you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's usually a lot of finished off bad,
you know harmful or Things that take a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: to produce, you know those type of things
so what we're just utilizing is natural
[SPEAKER_09]: systems lots of compost Roots and and
yeah, that's how that's the alternative
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the alternative to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the vitality comes through the
butt, you know plants grows still to full
[SPEAKER_09]: potential And then your systems can last
longer So great great comprehensive answer
[SPEAKER_04]: guys, thank you so we're gonna wrap So if
people want more information about what
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys are doing do you want to give us
your Contact info your website info where
[SPEAKER_02]: people can learn more Yeah, we have an
Instagram page we just are posting things
[SPEAKER_02]: often Just pictures and some ideas and
give things dragonfly earth medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: then our website is dragonfly earth
medicine So that's us calm and if you just
[SPEAKER_09]: push contact on on our website You can
it's just a direct email to us and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: really Take it and make it important to
answer every person that writes in with
[SPEAKER_09]: any questions So we're in contact with a
lot of people and if people want to find
[SPEAKER_09]: out more about the peer Certification and
what that means and what your farms are
[SPEAKER_09]: out there They can find that out on our
website and online as well, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a lot of people doing amazing
We're providing really amazing medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: ecologically some way One more question
for you guys from the chat people were
[SPEAKER_04]: wondering do you add what do you Think
about adding external microbes Such as
[SPEAKER_04]: mammoth pee or soil balance those type
products Do you use anything like that or
[SPEAKER_04]: do you just make your own tea blends and
stick to your own micro blends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well for our own property, we utilize all
the indigenous microorganisms here because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to create beneficial,
you know intelligence Here on our
[SPEAKER_02]: property, you know, we see your your
entire property is a microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we're creating the
intelligence here On our property,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for our for our products We go out and
buy beneficial Microbiology and then add
[SPEAKER_02]: it to our herbs as we're explaining before
and the most important part of your
[SPEAKER_02]: question is just to make sure that you
know Where that microbiology is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from and you know how it's made Often
these are made on you know GMO substrates
[SPEAKER_02]: or often it's produced in really large
facilities that are really unhealthy for
[SPEAKER_02]: the planet so it's important to Really
find out how it's produced and and the
[SPEAKER_09]: company that stands behind it So and if
it's preserved and if it's in liquid,
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes there's preservatives in liquid
So it's always best to use raw materials
[SPEAKER_09]: to feed your microbes So, I mean if you
don't have raw material if you think
[SPEAKER_09]: you're out of balance of microbes I mean,
maybe you should get a soil test but to
[SPEAKER_09]: know for sure or maybe you just know
because you could because you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah Preservatives are another thing
Thank you and I appreciate you through us
[SPEAKER_04]: and thinking of all these different points
of how you're even your raw materials that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're putting into your your substrates
how those are processed and I mean Again,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to think of all these issues and
it gets complicated because you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have to think of the people that are
Making these things and are you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the working conditions like for
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can so yeah, I appreciate you guys
Difficult points and trying to do the best
[SPEAKER_04]: you can and do the right thing and keep
all the integrity to the plant you can So

[SPEAKER_01]: sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I Now that you're on stage,
I apologize in advance in case it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: jumbled but I was thinking like what's the
appropriate song well, I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that at a fish show fish has got a song
called dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's four letter word right dirt sounds
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dirt is soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it dirt but in fish
circles, the song is called dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here it is.
So,
[SPEAKER_12]: So, So,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to live beneath the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tiny space to move and breathe is all
that I would ever need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to live beneath the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be free from push and shove like all
those swarming up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever think of me, kneel down
and kiss the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what this thought is worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never hear your voice again.
