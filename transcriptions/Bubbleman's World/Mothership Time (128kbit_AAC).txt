[SPEAKER_00]: We have Old Man here, just about to rip
into the new mothership, new to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just snagged this from Flap421,
if you haven't checked him out on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got a new one here,
we haven't done the, I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: Degenerate art documentary pop down with
the majority of, well most of it was his
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, and one piece from mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an incredible glass collection,
and he was nice enough to part with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership, so I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if he thinks on this, it's gonna ruin
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of hits on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've already had them, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership, get yours.
