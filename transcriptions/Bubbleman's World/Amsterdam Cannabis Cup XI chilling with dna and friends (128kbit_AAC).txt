[SPEAKER_02]: opening ceremony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey what's up guys, Old Man here sitting
here with Tony and Orange from DNA
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics and this is the DNA Genetics
green room headquarters room so Tony and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have come down to talk to DNA,
Don and Aaron they're in the other room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put us in this TV set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put us in this TV set.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be in another TV set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both promicky into a different set.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can pick a location.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Interim right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be back in Chile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be in Paris.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be in Prague.
[SPEAKER_02]: Niagara Falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright we might try all of those but yeah
you were gonna take a fresh rip out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: RUR brand new tube or at least cleaned
fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it brand new or clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: No it's just clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cleaned well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go with the fresh green red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and light vaporized styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely that kosher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our anchors actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an important relationship on
both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowing the herb and knowing the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowing the resin will definitely help you
grow better.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has a good chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'm afraid about is it's
just like on old strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not old but a stranger we've been using
quite long already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strain that you don't get fed off
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really love our kosher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing counts for our LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people appreciate the LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I think because so many people try to
grow it and don't grow it like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who grew this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was grown like gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to pull my macro lens out
when I see things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really just got to go get some
batteries this trip so I can start
[SPEAKER_04]: shooting macro again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we actually got a macro lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one for us to try and make some
nice nut shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said earlier we were talking about
setting up our set up room for us to make
[SPEAKER_01]: our weekly DNA video for the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well if you guys ever require heavy duty
high quality macro shots let the bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: man know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come down anytime and shoot bugs and
strains for your DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a 14 hour flight for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No but when I'm in town you know I've
always told these guys every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should set that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you here until when?
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah but I'll be back again probably
before next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see depending on where things bring
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just arrived back from dinner here at
the Krasnopolski Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very very full.
[SPEAKER_04]: With my good friend Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ate very good dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we must smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legends winner Sarah out in front of the
Krasnopolski Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony T the turpinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we walk through the Krasnopolski?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are at the Krasnopolski Aaron.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was a nicer entrance into
your place.
[SPEAKER_04]: A nicer entrance?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the back way.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the back way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if Dane is in his room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright back at the Krasnopolski.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great gardener just opened up oh a little
bit of 90 maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that 90 I smell from over here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys went with the 73 I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: The 73 upon producing like upon making it
was by far the most smelliest bag but upon
[SPEAKER_05]: aging now the 90 has now become more
smelly than the 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is holding that sort of shishka
sort of barb dank smell.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah this one smells a bit now though and
it just keeps changing right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have to say about that Aaron
from DNA Genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for my hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's DNA approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well here let's hit that actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know this is the melts but you
just pulled that out so why don't we do a
[SPEAKER_04]: little dabbley doodle of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you heat that little piece of
barb up and then dip it into the melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay and then dip it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh that was worked out rather well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh now I'm gonna strain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a shiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toss it into the sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright we have to be smart with hotel
puffing so just give him a puff that he
[SPEAKER_04]: can take.
[SPEAKER_04]: Running that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't need to run but you're
definitely not gonna take that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No no I'm just gonna.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna give you a nice little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you just blow it there you'll
be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't set it off yet it's way up
there and we haven't set it off yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love a little dab of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing on some barb wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeping it reals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost a big chunk of our group didn't
we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Gazi still out there waiting for and
where did Dawn go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did Tony go?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a room that's on the main floor
when we came in through that little.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you calling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah I just.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Set that back in.
That was a high two.
Nice.
