[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we sleep last night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last night in the fresh mountain air,
some whips of weed floating by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I didn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Bubble Man up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the pleasure of hanging out with
Marcus sometimes and hearing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and thinking, man, people need to
hear these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to write a book or make a movie
or give Bubble Man his own panel and do
[SPEAKER_00]: some story time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to be able to give
him that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited for us to hear some of
this exciting history and rich culture of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant and the people that have been
involved with it for a long time and take
[SPEAKER_00]: it seriously or passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please give me a warm welcome for
Marcus Richardson, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be dabbing honey bananas today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little honey booboo crossed with
strawberry nana from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so, so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost need a third hand here,
but I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, when Che asked me to speak this
year, I think we were actually at
[SPEAKER_06]: antidote, making some hash together from
his Sarah's Secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he asked me, hey, what would you want
to speak about?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't ever plan my talks, ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never planned a talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of come and speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when he asked me, what do you want
to speak about, I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll just tell some cool stories
about my history and about stories from
[SPEAKER_06]: the game, basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of what we called it before it
got all corporate and legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I got turned on to cannabis at 14
years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar to the scene out of Half
Baked with Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're all young and they smoke
their joint and they're all giggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when he's in the supermarket store
and he's like, Abba Zabba, you my only
[SPEAKER_06]: friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's hugging the big Abba Zabba bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar experience with me and my
friends after we smoked our first joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things escalated pretty quickly for me
after that first joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed like, I don't know how much time
went by, but before you knew it,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was flipping quarters and then ounces
and quarter pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I met this amazing man by the
name of Ron Hickey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ron Hickey was really, you know,
outside of my father, he was one of my
[SPEAKER_06]: first mentors and he was definitely my
first mentor in the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron lives in the Kootenays here in the
Kootenays in Proctor, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was originally a Winnipeg guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, for anyone that knew or
knows Ron, an absolute maniac,
[SPEAKER_06]: savage, awesome person.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so within a very short period of
meeting Ron, he started, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: cuffing me 10 packs, like 10 pounds of
weed at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy was a real character.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did 11 years in Stony Mountain
Penitentiary for being a habitual florist.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can imagine growing cannabis,
they put him in prison with some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: most dangerous people in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got his own incredible stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: He should be here telling his own stories
because even what he did while he was in
[SPEAKER_06]: prison and how many stabbings he kept from
happening, using cannabis to bring people
[SPEAKER_06]: together instead of, prison's a very
divided place by race more than gangs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he really brought people together
in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I met him very young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was probably 16 or 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some, maybe 18 even, I had some
plants that were sick and we went to his,
[SPEAKER_06]: he had a hydroponics store in the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a guy that did six years in
prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he's got a hydroponics store in the
Bible Belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I go there and ask him, you know,
oh, I'm growing these tomato plants and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're, they're not doing too
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, and I'm like literally probably
look like I'm 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's just like, look kid, I know
you're not growing tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we just talk about what you're
growing?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like in 1992 or 93.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just immediately has trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Starts telling me, takes me down to his
basement actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we start dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got this crazy oil and he's got hot
knives and now we're dabbing oil and he's
[SPEAKER_06]: telling me all this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he really brought me under his wing,
took me under his wing and allowed me to,
[SPEAKER_06]: to just be exposed to the world of
cannabis in a way that I would have never
[SPEAKER_06]: been exposed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron having the only hydroponics store in
the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: He basically set up everyone with their
grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what he would do is he would go
to each of those grows throughout the day
[SPEAKER_06]: and help make sure that they were all kind
of being lined up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hit this real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: A moment of silence for the honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could share this with all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I will when we're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not many of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could pull this off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll tell a few stories about Ron.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the funniest stories that I had
with Ron was Ron was a real wild man and
[SPEAKER_06]: it was just always the craziest shit
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one day he tells me, I've got five
gallons of chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, chloroform, like, like the stuff
you knock people out with.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, yeah, yeah, the solvent
chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, Ooh, isn't that like super
illegal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are you even allowed to have that?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, Oh yeah, it's super,
they watch it super carefully and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: bins have numbers and, but I managed to
get some and I poured it out and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: gave them back the empty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's got this chloroform and he says,
let's make some oil out of chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And make really good oil from chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're, we're in his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're soaking the weed in the chloroform
and we're, we're doing the soak and we
[SPEAKER_06]: cooled the chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: We froze, like made it very cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then we put the chloroform latent
oil on like little plates with a,
[SPEAKER_06]: with a little hot plate and a fan and was
blowing this chloroform oil out the back
[SPEAKER_06]: window of his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 20 minutes into this, I go outside
and I see this big squirrel and it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like dead, like right by the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it got chloroformed to death.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I, you know, Ron's a very caring
individual.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell him about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: He comes over, he's basically crying.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, Oh my God, Oh my God,
I killed the squirrel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we picked this thing up with a shovel
and we bring it into his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, within five or 10 minutes,
this, I, I, I was like, I think I saw it
[SPEAKER_06]: move.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it moved Ron.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it moved and it's sort of laying
there with its, its hands up and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: little pinky is doing this and then it's
doing this and we're watching it fairly
[SPEAKER_06]: stoned and suddenly it comes to life like
a hundred percent and starts tearing
[SPEAKER_06]: around his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're high on chloroform oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making chloroform oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have five gallons of chloroform,
which I'm sure at the time probably would
[SPEAKER_06]: have gotten us like five years in prison
just to have that five gallons of
[SPEAKER_06]: chloroform.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ended up, you know, for about 40
minutes chasing this scroll down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did some pretty good damage to his
house, tore up his couch, which I,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, was just a standard day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never forget his wife, Gail coming
home and being like, Ron, what happened?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we were making chloroform oil and we
thought we killed the squirrel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the squirrel like tore around the
house and ripped up the couch and the
[SPEAKER_06]: wallpaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was just like, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was just the most normal thing to
her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas most people might think that that
was a pretty insane moment in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what it was like being with Ron
every single day that you were with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a true mentor that really taught me
that anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was an incredible grower, still is a
great grower, really paid attention to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the flush and the, the giving
plants love, the intention, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: before I was exposed to it from,
you know, West coast people, dragonfly
[SPEAKER_06]: earth medicine is a perfect example of
that vibration of that like loving
[SPEAKER_06]: intention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Winnipeg wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a lot of that, but Ron,
whether he knew it or not, he had that,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though he projected himself to the
world to be very different than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he was really about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he taught that to me about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, I'm very type A OCD,
much like Ron was as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really clicked in that sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's still one of my best friends
to this day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love him dearly, wonderful man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really when people ask me about my
journey, like how did you become bubble
[SPEAKER_06]: man?
[SPEAKER_06]: It started really with Ron, like Ron was
the, if I didn't meet Ron, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have ended up on the same pathway
that, that I did end up on with here in
[SPEAKER_06]: the canvas world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just go through a quick little
history of these moments with Ron,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just kept escalating and he was
facilitating all of this exposure and all
[SPEAKER_06]: of this experience for me to tap into from
being at all these different people's
[SPEAKER_06]: grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: From seeing all these different
personalities and seeing all the different
[SPEAKER_06]: things in those people that weren't at the
top of their game projected and reflecting
[SPEAKER_06]: back to them in their plants through
mites, through aphids, through powdery
[SPEAKER_06]: mildew, through all of these different
sicknesses that the plants would have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you start correlating them to these
very specific people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, it was a very unique
experience to be able to go into 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_06]: or 50 grows in a city in the nineties
where it was so highly illegal that those
[SPEAKER_06]: people weren't even telling, you know,
their brother or their best friend where
[SPEAKER_06]: their grow was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just getting brought to all of
them from Ron, you know, Ron gave me
[SPEAKER_06]: immediate street cred with people that
were like, they didn't know who I was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked like I was 12 and it probably
made them very, very nervous growing
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in a city where if you get
caught, you go to stony mountain
[SPEAKER_06]: penitentiary, which is kind of like the
most extreme.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to be blessed for where we're at
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know a lot of people complain about
the corporations and the corporatization
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis and the over regulations and
all of this, but it beats being put in a
[SPEAKER_06]: cage for 10 years at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it definitely beats being pulled over
at gunpoint on the side of the road and
[SPEAKER_06]: taken and put in a cage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things should have never happened
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have to celebrate the fact that
we've gotten to a point now where we can
[SPEAKER_06]: all enjoy cannabis together.
[SPEAKER_06]: At a beautiful festival like this and just
give thanks, be grateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron sort of, you know, kept me going down
that pathway of like watching all these
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I didn't feel the urge to grow as
much of my own weed now that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: spending, you know, 12, 15 hours at a
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron would come get me at like seven or
eight o'clock at night and he dropped me
[SPEAKER_06]: off at like 10 or 11 the next morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd just be going to grows all throughout
the night and he'd be helping them figure
[SPEAKER_06]: out what was wrong with those grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through that I ended up, obviously,
you know, one of the best things Ron did
[SPEAKER_06]: was he gave me cannabis of such a high
quality that suddenly people were like,
[SPEAKER_06]: that guy has good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy over there, that guy Mark,
he's got good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's one of the bonuses,
you know, back then Ron was such an
[SPEAKER_06]: anomaly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few people grew cannabis on the level
that he grew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so having that also really bolstered
my ability to get into every group,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, from high school.
[SPEAKER_06]: What clique were you in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't in a clique.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sold weed to all of them,
you know, every clique, whichever they
[SPEAKER_06]: were.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always weed smokers in each of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the ones that I found.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up eventually meeting a pretty
cool group of guys, Martin Muravchik,
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Shwaesky, John Geo, Neil Chippendale
would be in there as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the early days in Manitoba,
and we got it in our heads as we were
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking cannabis that we were going to try
and get hemp growing in our province.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of, we sort of started,
this was like 93 and we started doing
[SPEAKER_06]: research and finding out that,
you know, there are these amendments in
[SPEAKER_06]: the drug and peace law that was done back
in like 67.
[SPEAKER_06]: That if the THC is below 0.3%,
0.3 or below, the classification of
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana would change to hemp and that
hemp would fall under a different set of
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations that were not as stringent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, most of our supporters laughed at us
and told us we would get hemp growing in
[SPEAKER_06]: the ground when hell freezes over.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for those of you that have ever been
to Winnipeg, know that A, it is hell and
[SPEAKER_06]: B, that it absolutely does freeze over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every winter, swear to God, oh thank you,
she hears my dry mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: My beautiful wife of 35 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The queen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we got into this whole hemp
activism thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of realized, listen, Winnipeg is
not the place in 93 to be pushing the THC
[SPEAKER_06]: agenda or the medical or the recreational,
all of ones that we loved and believed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we thought we better come at this one
from a far angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we applied for hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured out a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Long story short, we basically got a
license an experimental license to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp in 95, 1995.
[SPEAKER_06]: We applied in 94, we didn't get it that
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was only two Canadians that got it
that year, Joe Strobel and Jeff Keim.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were a tobacco farmer and a lawyer
from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we ended up getting this license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll never forget it because we
actually brought Ron to the field when it
[SPEAKER_06]: was about five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were in my Volkswagen van and I
drove him right through the middle of the
[SPEAKER_06]: field.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd only been out of prison for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it brought tears to his eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He couldn't believe that he was like,
this looks like weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of told a fib.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of told them that hemp was a
distant cousin of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of that THC percentage,
they accepted that for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of things when it comes to
regulation is not about trying to make
[SPEAKER_06]: them see the light.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is to speak the specific language
that unlocks the door that allows it to
[SPEAKER_06]: happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't do that, you just bang
your head against the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got this hemp license.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grew this hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up moving away to British Columbia
soon after, 96.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife and I, we moved west.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my partners kept at it and they built
a substantial thing with the hemp industry
[SPEAKER_06]: in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a company called Manitoba Harvest
Fresh Hemp Foods, which is the oil and the
[SPEAKER_06]: seed that is available in all the
supermarkets that many of you have
[SPEAKER_06]: probably purchased.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a bunch of just sort of stoned
young teenager guys sitting around
[SPEAKER_06]: dreaming a dream that seemed impossible
even to the people who would share that
[SPEAKER_06]: dream with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we made it happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved out west and linked up with the
one friend that I had out west.
[SPEAKER_06]: I only really knew one person.
[SPEAKER_06]: And her name was Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she worked at Hemp BC for Mark
Emery back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was just really cool whenever we
showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other people that worked
there, we just felt because we were
[SPEAKER_06]: Winnipeg guys, just these prairie guys
rolling in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably had strong prairie accents and
just stuck out in a way that we didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: realize we were sticking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got a lot of the I'm too cool for
school energy given back at us when we
[SPEAKER_06]: would go to Hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we drive 25 hours to go to this
shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if no one cared, it kind of felt
personal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Hilary cared.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was always like, oh, it's the
Winnipeg hemp guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'd always have the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a big fan of the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron, of course, hooked me up with the
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another story.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Hilary ended up, when I moved out
to BC, she was kind of like in love with
[SPEAKER_06]: this guy, Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was in Los Angeles growing in this
huge mansion, a big crop, which was insane
[SPEAKER_06]: because he was neighbors with Ronald
Reagan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, no, it's worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thank god Hilary wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Todd did five years in Terminal
Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: In California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's had cancer multiple times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his spine is fused together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's like, not that anyone deserves to
be in prison, but it's harder to be in
[SPEAKER_06]: prison when you have like disabilities and
you're somewhat fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rene Beauger was also seen watering a
plant at that grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanted to extradite her.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to put her in prison for a
mandatory minimum of 10 years because they
[SPEAKER_06]: had one photo of her watering one single
cannabis plant out on the deck at Todd's
[SPEAKER_06]: house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Hilary was trying to figure out,
should I go live with Todd in California
[SPEAKER_06]: or should I stay here in BC?
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe she's like, I have this idea
inspired by Valerie Corral and Dennis
[SPEAKER_06]: Perron and all the people that were doing
medical cannabis in California in the
[SPEAKER_06]: early to mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Hilary was inspired by all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: She got exposed to it through Grateful
Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically was like, I want to start
like a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: But not a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'd be over at our house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember her writing on a piece of
paper like, these are the words I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: She went through this whole list.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she's like, these are the words I
do like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Compassion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it became the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like boom, I was one of the first growers
for the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then through my experience of selling
cannabis at the time, because I was pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: decent at it, I was able to help the club
through that experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, what I can do is, when I'm out
buying all this cannabis, I can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: pull small lots of the nicest and just get
it to the club even at a loss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was like, the Cannabis
Compassion Club started as the most
[SPEAKER_06]: vulnerable people from our society.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are the mentally ill,
there are the homeless, there are the drug
[SPEAKER_06]: addicted, and there are the terminally
ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the time, the original members
of the BC Compassion Club checked all four
[SPEAKER_06]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are extremely vulnerable people.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one in their right mind was going to
the Compassion Club and being like,
[SPEAKER_06]: holy shit, I'm going to monetize.
[SPEAKER_06]: This dude, I'm going to make so much money
selling weed to these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Hillary also, for many,
many, many, many years, sort of suffered
[SPEAKER_06]: the life of a pauper because it was always
about helping these people that needed the
[SPEAKER_06]: most help.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was an incredible thing to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was one of the first medical cannabis
court cases for the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was coming home with a little bit of
flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, a little bit compared to the day,
but 16 pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went through a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might have also been on
mushrooms, and it could have been 2 AM.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's neither here nor there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went through this roadblock,
and to me, it seemed very set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had this sort of clipboard,
and he was letting cars through without
[SPEAKER_06]: even talking to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I came up, he was like,
he just knew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew someone had told.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Hillary was like, I'll be
testifying for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: John Conroy was my lawyer, which was a
completely incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the end, or towards the middle,
John was being asked by the lawyer and the
[SPEAKER_06]: prosecutor and the judge, what's a good
day for the next court case?
[SPEAKER_06]: And his learned friend says, November
22nd, such and such a year, 98,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And John's like, no, Your Honor,
that won't be good for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leans back into my ear and says,
because I'll be going to the Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_06]: in Amsterdam with my client.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to Amsterdam together in
November of that year, which we did,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was an awesome trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stayed at the hotel tour and next to the
Anne Frank House.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so I ended up kind of going
through that whole court case.
[SPEAKER_06]: The club was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the people at the club, lots of
patients that I had known from day one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would send a school bus or a bus to go
pick up any people that wanted to come and
[SPEAKER_06]: show support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would also donate flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be like, here's an eighth or a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time they rolled up, I'd give them
some flour because I knew how important it
[SPEAKER_06]: was, which we did also through all the
holidays and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ended up getting no fine, no time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The judge ordered my money be given back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the most intense part of it was the
prosecuting attorney who was a total
[SPEAKER_06]: prosecutor, cowboy boots.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just like the Texan prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And John and him had known each other for
25 years at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at one point, this prosecutor comes up
to John and tells him, look, so and so,
[SPEAKER_06]: our good buddy is in the hospital and is
dying of cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after listening to this whole case,
which was all about the medical use of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and why it should be accessible,
which is why when medical cannabis was
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed and they didn't bust them all,
that the judge said in my case,
[SPEAKER_06]: if we're going to allow medical cannabis,
then we can't expect it to fall from the
[SPEAKER_06]: sky like manna.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what opened up transportation
of medical cannabis in Canada,
[SPEAKER_06]: this court case.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, no fine, no time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Judge ordered my money be given back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did catch a felony for it, which I got
scrubbed years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I never looked at it as a negative.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: This was incredible work that Hillary did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt blessed to just be allowed to be a
part of that work that she was doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once I got busted, I couldn't really
sell weed anymore, even though I probably
[SPEAKER_06]: could have.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to me, the way I knew the game,
it was like, nah, I can't really do this
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like maybe I'm a heat score.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're watching me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the end, they weren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could have probably kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead, I had to come to a
crossroads.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really good at something and able to
make money doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I couldn't do it at all,
cold turkey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to figure out another way to
maintain paying for the lifestyle that I
[SPEAKER_06]: had acquired, which was very different
from the one I grew up in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was like, OK, I got to get out
there and I got to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had heard about this bag system,
a two-bag water hash system from
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd seen it, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, wow, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I could sell that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could sell that system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I met with the woman who I thought,
at the time, who had created this bag
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, she was just selling the bag
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would learn the true history later
through an insane five-year-long patent
[SPEAKER_06]: lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, I went to Amsterdam,
tried to get into selling these bags for
[SPEAKER_06]: her, but kind of rubbed her the wrong way
that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know a lot of Dutch
people, especially ones that own coffee
[SPEAKER_06]: shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they deal with a lot of Americans.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes, at the end of the week,
they've dealt with too many.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she kind of lashed out on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there to buy 500 to 1,000 of these
two-bag kits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I came home super bummed, because I
really thought, this is what we can invest
the money on.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little bit of money that we have left
and start a whole company with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I came home devastated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my wife was like, why don't we just
make our own?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, what do you mean,
make our own?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, yeah, we could just sell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could just sell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was the birth of fresh headies
and bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really where I chose the silly
moniker bubble man to promote this
[SPEAKER_06]: concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, maybe there's people
here that don't know what bubble bags are.
[SPEAKER_06]: That scares me if you don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you, it's just a simple bag
system with screen bottoms that allow you
[SPEAKER_06]: to use water and ice to isolate the resin
glands from the plant to create a very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very concentrated, pure, pure,
pure version of hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had great, great luck with that
company and with the whole process,
[SPEAKER_06]: going online and selling it, creating an
online business in like 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: 89, 2000, like right when that sort of
scene started.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like digital cameras were just
coming out, online services to take credit
[SPEAKER_06]: cards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was sort of colliding
simultaneously for a lot of different
[SPEAKER_06]: people to pivot and switch into web-based
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we created this company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow, bubble bags really took off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was mind blowing how much it took off
and how it just changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It changed everything, like suddenly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you, the whole reason I
wanted to do that was because I saw John
[SPEAKER_06]: Conroy take a paper bag full of money that
if I had gotten pulled over with it like
[SPEAKER_06]: five minutes earlier, they would have been
like, this is proceeds of crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: He takes that paper bag, he goes to the
bank and just gives it to them because
[SPEAKER_06]: he's a respective lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just cash that money into his
bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of selling weed to get money,
I could sell something that people use
[SPEAKER_06]: with weed to get money, but I'm not
involved in the weed part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was another part of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, if I can get money,
because here's the thing, even during a
[SPEAKER_06]: recession, people who sell weed are still
making money.
[SPEAKER_06]: People who have weed money are like,
yeah, I'll buy some bubble bags for 300
[SPEAKER_06]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, fuck, I want to make some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll buy a tumbler.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll buy a, you know, like people who are
deep into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have all the toys, have all the tools,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I figured, well, this is,
if I can create a tool, and it's not that
[SPEAKER_06]: we created it, but we definitely pioneered
and bettered it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two bags weren't enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an eight bag system now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it came about was just,
it was just all of that timing colliding
[SPEAKER_06]: simultaneously, me getting busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really led me to believe too,
that when you're manifesting your future,
[SPEAKER_06]: they always say, oh, it'll come in ways
you least expect it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, so many people spend enormous
amounts of time and energy manifesting a
[SPEAKER_06]: future that they allow to pass them by
because they're so stuck on recognizing
[SPEAKER_06]: what that manifestation should look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think it's an opportunity,
but it almost always represents itself as
[SPEAKER_06]: an obstacle at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for me to be able to go through a
roadblock years later and see Constable
[SPEAKER_06]: John Lowe, the guy that busted me with the
Compassion Club weed, and to thank him and
[SPEAKER_06]: be like, dude, I am not upset with you in
any way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, like, you helped change and
pivot my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might have given him one jab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might have said, there are
literally tons of hashish being made all
[SPEAKER_06]: around the world thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, tons.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how much more time I have
left.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of leads me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 11.55.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone organizing this at all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or should I just talk for a little bit
longer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep going for a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, and bubble bags just by 2002,
from 99 to 2002, it was a hustle.
[SPEAKER_06]: But by 2003, it was substantial.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like money coming in, bags going
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more importantly, and I'll tell you
another time that it was pivotal for me
[SPEAKER_06]: that I really knew that this was going to
be serious was one of my first customers
[SPEAKER_06]: was a woman from Indiana.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, this is 99.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how illegal cannabis is in
Indiana in 1999?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it is go to prison time,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's like this like middle America
church woman, like just very straight and
[SPEAKER_06]: very just like, she's like, I saw your ad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that what I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I understand it correctly, but
basically what your tool can do is make a
[SPEAKER_06]: purified medicine with with with
marijuana, she said.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I said, yes, basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she bought a small set of bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her father was very sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was 86 years old and he had wasting
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he weighed a very, very, very,
very like 87 pounds or something,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of what you weigh right before you
pass away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she had heard the cannabis and I
think she even saw it on a movie or
[SPEAKER_06]: something like the munchies and kind of
like, why would they make that joke?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because when you eat, when you smoke
cannabis, it gives you the munchies,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the generalization doesn't give me
the munchies, but everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't let me lose where my train of
thought was going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you, Harvard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indiana woman.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she buys the bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: She sends me this crazy letter like this
is how long ago this was right.
[SPEAKER_06]: She sent me a letter and a handwritten
letter and basically said told me this
[SPEAKER_06]: whole story.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, look, I went I was like out on
the streets buying like an ounce of
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so terrified.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she gets this weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes home.
[SPEAKER_06]: She bought her bubble bags in ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like more advanced than most
hardcore cannabis users in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she has no relationship with it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the love of her father and the
worry of losing him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she she makes him the bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if she dried it properly or
whatnot, but she put it in his corn cob
[SPEAKER_06]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how old this motherfucker was.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a corn cob pipe and he puffed this
bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she's like, and he ate a whole
McCain's chocolate cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: That night, which is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also what you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also like, oh, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's both of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I reacted both of those ways
when I read the letter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, holy shit, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like I just thought it would be
cool to let people smoke great hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's implications that go deeper
into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is that whole compassion club
relationship of because cannabis has sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of two sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: There this recreational, which I really
call recreational preventative.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the preventative medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the medicinal,
which is more serious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually when once people are like really
focused on cannabis as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're fairly sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and that's what I hope to see
change in the future where we don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: to wait till we have stage three colon
cancer to decide to take cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's sort of this way that you can use
it as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, in my opinion, I was watching
TV the other night because my wife and I
[SPEAKER_06]: were staying at a hotel and we saw these
pharmaceutical commercials with like the
[SPEAKER_06]: most insane side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, holy shit, imagine the only
side effect cannabis has is the feeling of
[SPEAKER_06]: euphoria getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is the greatest medicine ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's been great to me throughout
these last 30 years of my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been really cool to be allowed to be
in a position where we were this catalyst
[SPEAKER_06]: for hash making around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that I've been
passionate about for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a party called Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to do it in Amsterdam for many,
many years and I've done it in Barcelona
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've done it in Vancouver and even did
one in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we do them in Los Angeles and
they're really a bridge to the old history
[SPEAKER_06]: of hashish and paying homage to how that
came about and understanding these
[SPEAKER_06]: different places that people went to use
and smoke hashish and how different
[SPEAKER_06]: cultures grow and collect and smoke
hashish and sort of paying homage to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, bringing in the new
and showing this new methodology of like
[SPEAKER_06]: what we can do when we increase that
science of extraction and isolation to get
[SPEAKER_06]: these things that really didn't exist 50
to 60 years ago that now do today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's kind of one of my ways to
pay back annually, have a really great
[SPEAKER_06]: party, 300, 350 people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashish is the focus for the entire party.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a little competition in there
as well that people do and sort of always
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully one day we'll be able to bring
it back to British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess in the meantime, I don't know if I
have anything else to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Che.
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.
