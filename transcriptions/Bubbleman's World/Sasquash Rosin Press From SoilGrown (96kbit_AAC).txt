[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I wanted to take you guys through a
little bit of a, I guess a pre-review of
[SPEAKER_02]: the new Sasquatch rosin press that I got
from the Sasquatch rosin press company
[SPEAKER_02]: owned by, of course, Soil Grown Sal,
Philip, Phil, if you check out Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil Grown, underscore solventless,
Soil Grown solventless, I believe is his
[SPEAKER_02]: name, has these incredible presses that
he's come to design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we all know Soil Grown for his
popularizing of the rosin method and
[SPEAKER_02]: really for taking it to the next level and
bringing and creating flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I had heard of rosin was
only from hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't as exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't an easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bit of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Phil really brought it to the next
level and created his Soil Grown brand and
[SPEAKER_02]: he created his Sasquatch rosin press,
which he's operating that company with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of his cousins, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just a great crew of guys that
are just looking to better the movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely don't have some horrible
agenda of trying to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ready to learn and they're looking
to share their education in a good quality
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Customized plates, beautiful plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a little bit about the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with a nice 20-ton jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've hooked it up to the DeWalt 15-ton 200
PSI air compressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 300 US dollars for this big
ass air compressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the unit is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom plate is the heated unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they went with a one heated
unit was that the plates are so big and
[SPEAKER_02]: they hold the temperature so well that
once you get both plates up to
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, and I'll tell you how to do
that in about a second, they hold the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature really well and for a good
chunk of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bottom plate is impeccably wired.
[SPEAKER_02]: It heats up beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a real nice digital readout.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can control any temperature that you
want to put into the decimal point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is, which is what Soil
Grown told me personally to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was to bring the bottom plate up to
temperature with the top plate hovering
[SPEAKER_02]: half an inch or so above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get that bottom plate up to
temperature, lower the plate so they
[SPEAKER_02]: touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the touching, you basically will
heat your second plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave this thing on all throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would really be only something
that you would do in the morning as you
[SPEAKER_02]: were starting your day if it was a work
tool that you were using commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using it just personally, but I still
come in the morning and I turn it on and I
[SPEAKER_02]: leave it on all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did talk a little bit about how long it
takes for the plates to heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that for me, it took about 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil Grown said that it can take up to 30
or 40 minutes if it's a real cold morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and you go out to your shop and you turn
them on and they're really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't experience that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very nice out around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found in a 70 degree temperature,
they were able to heat up within 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes and get to temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's told me that he's used a little laser
temperature to read out the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: thermometer and he said his press plates
have been within one degree of the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice accuracy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, it's a nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't suggest trying to lift the unit
by itself, but he did put on two nice big
[SPEAKER_02]: handles at the top that makes it possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, what else can I say
about this thing other than let me show
[SPEAKER_02]: you some of the footage of what we did the
other day and we used some sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash, which I'll show you right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, the quality isn't the top
top quality, but it's definitely not too
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is the sweet skunk 73
micron that we're pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a three, 3.5 star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has a great bouquet to it, the nose,
but it is pushing out the most golden,
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what I did show on camera
yesterday, which was the preparation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the majority of you guys
understand and know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to show you really simply,
you know, for those of you that are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to wonder and haven't seen my other
videos, I take one of these little
[SPEAKER_02]: screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some from, from soil grown that
he sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a nice big schwack of these
screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to those guys for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I usually do is I use a sticker
or usually I use a business card and I get
[SPEAKER_02]: it into there just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can easily scoop bubble hash out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did was we put about six to
eight grams in each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy had them substantially thicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thinned them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rather would, I would rather do a long,
a big flat surface area than one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: too fat and thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a way to up your numbers is to simply,
you can really see this, this one had a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a blowout and you can see
that the stuff that's remaining is really
[SPEAKER_02]: just not even like hash anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a powdery sort of talcum powdery
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for who knows what, maybe a coconut
oil extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would definitely be interesting to see
these get tested for cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile to see what gets left
behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, I'm sure there's a percentage
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's even a percentage of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll finish it off with some
money shots of the OG and the sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: that we pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in the videos that I'm a noob.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see the waterfall effect and
wasn't quite sure how far back I had to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave the little packet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the packet slid forward each time with
the hash bulbing out of the two presses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a dangerous game because you can
breach your screen, get a blowout,
[SPEAKER_02]: a cut, and then that is obviously going to
contaminate your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few times we actually thought it had
happened when it hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from the bubbles in the raw and
creating a darker strip down the middle,
[SPEAKER_02]: we assumed it was some black from hash
that was coming out from the inside,
[SPEAKER_02]: but on a few occasions it was not the
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a short little video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do a full video where you see me
sitting at the press and showing the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: process, but this just lets you see what's
capable for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is the DeWalt 15
gallon, not 15 ton, 200 PSI air
[SPEAKER_02]: compressor, the one Soil Grown uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's his custom Bubble Man's World
plates with the 20 ton jack attached on
[SPEAKER_02]: his Sasquatch press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is the PDI temperature
controller, the set, and the up and down
[SPEAKER_02]: button, the original flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought to you by Sasquatch Rosin Press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are doing the first press with
some OG Kush three-star bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: eight grams in the pouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down a little bit, like real slow and
gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of pre-squish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait like two or three seconds and then
squish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, glad that didn't blow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doggy doggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this thing feels like fucking empty
now, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, is that nice looking resin,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you can see it come out as you click
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that darkness in it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we didn't blow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it though, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad, it kind of just dissipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the absolute stunning quality
of this resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just dripped beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't show you, but it's literally as
hard as a rock now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could peel these little pieces off
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of tiny little air bubbles,
which makes for really nice macro
[SPEAKER_02]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie, we were extremely
happy with how this press turned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the OG Kush three-star,
keep in mind, and we were getting over 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive for three-star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up we have the Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like a 3.5, close to a four-star.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wrapped it up, did about seven grams,
I do believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the patty pushed in far enough this
time, so we didn't have the near blowout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to Soil Grown's tip,
which was to reduce the plates to the
[SPEAKER_02]: point where they're just about squishing,
where you can see now the oil just
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to come out of the lip of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a couple of more, and you see the
oil actually start dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used a little bit lower of a PSI on
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of us actually laughed at this point
in the video as we were filming it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the color was just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with the two hundred and fifty degree
temperature and pressing for quite a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, I don't know if it was a 15 second
or even potentially a 20 second press,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was longer than I normally press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the lack of pressure,
it wasn't pushing it all out, it was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also didn't realize a lot of the resin
was going out the backside of the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we opened it up, there was a nice
squish all the way around the screen,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you can see here as we open up the
plates and get that parchment open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it squished all the way
around, and the patty just fell right out
[SPEAKER_02]: with the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin was just beautiful to collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it here coming up in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to just grab one section of it
with my dabber, and it just peeled off
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a nice dab, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice color, very nice taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that extreme strong spicy exotic
haze taste that I love so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is the last press that we're
going to share with you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a near blowout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I once again left the packet too close to
the edge of the press, and you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: that dark piece that's pushing out in the
center is actually the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really ideal or how you want to
do it, but I was already committed and the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin was coming out quite lovely for the
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a seven gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second run, we were getting quite nice
returns, which is very high for a three
[SPEAKER_02]: star and even a 3.5, and it's kind of why
I was hinting that it could be potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: closer to four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the melting factor wasn't
there, the resin was definitely inside
[SPEAKER_02]: those gland heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a nice big clear dome popping up,
and that's all she wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pull this off and collect
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share you one last little clip of some
resin dripping down the screen in a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: close up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's that drip, drip, drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys all for watching
this video and spending time with us here
[SPEAKER_02]: on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, Soil Grown and Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man, set up the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of strain you have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is so clean and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab,
dab, dab, dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dabadoo time, the dabadoo time,
time to dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab,
dab, dab, dab in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dabadoo time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabadoo time, fresh from the extract,
100% pure ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a spoke, it's a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean and pretty like gold.
Thanks for watching!
