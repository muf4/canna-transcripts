[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here with Dom and Max from the
Sunrise Wellness Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see both of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you too.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, as you can remember from the
last Puff Wednesday Part 2, the Sunrise
[SPEAKER_03]: Wellness Foundation episode, Johnny and I
went and we purchased a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_03]: flower flavors to squish for our personal
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys were like, hey,
we have some stuff that we would also like
[SPEAKER_03]: squished.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they gave me a jar of the Teflon and
they gave me about 36 grams of the O9
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I was playing around with the
materials that I had purchased from them,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was platinum Girl Scout Cookies
crossed with Wi-Fi 43 and Teflon,
[SPEAKER_03]: those were the two I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Johnny B had the O9 Cookies and the
Teflon or Gorilla Cooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we pressed all of that, had a great
time, learned a lot about the different
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't press a lot of flour,
I press mostly hash, bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: dry sift, finger rub for that matter,
but not a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Came out pretty high temperature,
240 degrees, was pressing for about 15 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 seconds and getting a really stable,
shattery rosin that still had a wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: taste, didn't have any burnt popcorn
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people were like stressing on me
and saying I was pressing too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: People throwing around numbers like 180
degrees, 200 degrees, 210, so I started
[SPEAKER_03]: experimenting with those with a little bit
of flour that I had and immediately came
[SPEAKER_03]: to the conclusion, obviously, that I'm
sure a lot of you have already come to
[SPEAKER_03]: that a low temperature, longer press is
going to produce a buttery rosin compared
[SPEAKER_03]: to a shorter press with a much warmer
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get this more consistent sort of pull
and snap or even a shatter type end
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't want to press the material
without them because it's really kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: personal choice that you need to make how
you want your rosin to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them were producing the same
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting 20 plus percent from the
rosin, whether it was butter or whether it
[SPEAKER_03]: was shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're going to do a variety of
things today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dom and Max have already processed and
gotten the plant matter broken up
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We contacted Phil, soil grown,
and I asked him, hey, what's the best way
[SPEAKER_03]: to process flour?
[SPEAKER_03]: He told us Phil the pouch is about half
Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave the nugs in full, leave them
basically as nugs, but break them up for
[SPEAKER_03]: the first few that you put in so that the
corners of the screen are filled up,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I thought you guys both knew that
tip when I mentioned it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really great tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to know a really great
tip, that is one, because the oil will
[SPEAKER_03]: pool into those corners and you'll lose a
substantial amount in a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's why people don't like to
use screens and why they say, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm losing oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do a variety of things
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already done a little press.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pressed my last bud of the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, can I offer you guys a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love a dab of Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to maybe prepare a few there
and I'll get the pipe over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually going to put a little bit
of water in the bubbler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this stuff looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we pressed this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: 220 or 230?
[SPEAKER_03]: 220.
[SPEAKER_03]: 220.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this Teflon bud was processed,
or processed, pressed, extracted at 220
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it was under a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't time it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just kind of doing it loose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to have some nice dabs for the,
for the Rosin video.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we pull yourself off one,
get it ready on the dabber there,
[SPEAKER_03]: Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, let's use the little root
sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Root sciences hooked me up with a little
dab mat the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny, I have so many different
oil slick dab mats, different kinds,
[SPEAKER_03]: that just seeing another different one,
like a circular one that just fits the
[SPEAKER_03]: pipe so perfect is appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make sure you have one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't leave you hanging and give you a
carb cap less rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friends don't let friends dab without carb
caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, well, unless you absolutely don't
have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we MacGyver that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty excited to get squishing on this
flower, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, we're gonna film it a nice,
you know, we're gonna show you the full
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation of, you know, putting it in,
squishing it out, opening it, and
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting all of the Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, because we have so many
packs here, there's about 10 here,
[SPEAKER_03]: or 11 even.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna just really show you the quick
clip of each one getting pressed,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the squish that we got out of each
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we weigh each one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all weighed to 6.9 to 7.1 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this was another thing that we
talked to Phil about, soil grown sal.
[SPEAKER_03]: He mentioned to us that, you know,
starting at about 240 degrees,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a 15 second press, finding out your
stability, finding out your quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: finding out your yields, that lets you
know from there that you can move down in
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature and, you know, notice the
differences that you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously, people don't want to
waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get as much as they can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't want to get, especially us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not coming at this from the point
where we want to get so much at the
[SPEAKER_03]: expense of any of the quality or flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I can tell people out there
already are saying, well then you gotta
[SPEAKER_03]: press it all at 180.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's definitely a higher
concentration of flavor in the lower
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature presses, but at the same time,
God, it's still such quality when it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pressed a little warmer and that snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still tons of flavor in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is kind of an in-between butter
and shatter texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to have you guys over for a little
dab sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Booyah!
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez, it's a house fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice strong buzz off that Teflon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hashy kind of creamy taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great tasting oil for, with, you know,
flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice for me, I gotta admit,
because for water hash, for dry sift,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really need to have a decent amount to
be able to play.
[SPEAKER_03]: With rosin, you can have a very small
amount of bud and still get in the game.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's one of the things why
it's going to be such a popular,
[SPEAKER_03]: why it is such a popular method and
growing every day because it's so easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: get in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even this machine for 2,300 U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: is pretty amazing considering what you
would spend on a butane close loop
[SPEAKER_03]: extractor, CO2 machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other machine that makes oil is going
to be a fairly high cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the higher end units on the
marketplace right now for commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, a couple of grand U
.S., three grand Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I say we're dabbed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get squishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to head over to the other side
of the table and we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: operate the press as a team here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're over here on the other side of
the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically real nice presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We packed the all screen mesh bags exactly
how Phil has requested, leaving a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: open sort of half, well, a third of the
lip of screen, which you can just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's nice and packed in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to slap that into our
parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbleached.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crack that open for me there, Dom.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, gentlemen, shall we give that a
little premise or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little collection there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to squish that more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're going to squish it more for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to give these guys an idea of
what came out, we were looking for about a
[SPEAKER_03]: gram and a half of rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would definitely say we probably got
about a half to a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we probably got a little bit more to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to grab, run that out and put
it gently on that metal piece out back
[SPEAKER_03]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to close that up.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed more pressure to slow down a
couple more times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it really just started right at
the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could start hearing it going,
what the color on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll need the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got most of it on one side from closing
it, which is always a nice maneuver.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: The color is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the creamiest, lightest,
blondest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that feel right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right between creamy and pouring this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it just feels like ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy moes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we'll find out how efficient
we were by merely getting this first
[SPEAKER_03]: weighed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be interesting to see how much more
squishes out of that on our second squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll let us know what we need to do
for, for time wise for allowing it to
[SPEAKER_03]: squish out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was about a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we definitely have a good solid,
like 0.8 to another gram of, of rosin that
[SPEAKER_03]: should come out of, out of the next
squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're just going to do a
quick little secondary press on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy, we weren't using all the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also folded it in half just to let
you know there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not pressing out as a whole flat
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to flatten it up for my second one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I thought it was going to be
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blasted it out a tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We blasted out the bud just a tiny,
tiniest little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you can see, we got that missing
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gram we were looking for,
here it is right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely say that's probably
about a gram compared to what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a half gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to just go drop her on there for
a second?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was saying is when you're pressing
such great quality material, and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunate that the majority of the
dispensaries, this isn't the easiest thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just not a lot of supply of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people want to grow things that
don't take long to flower, yield a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these things, the truth is,
they're harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things are just easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: To do it right as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, God bless those that are doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we doing on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo wee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just giant pile of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go right there, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Point one, one gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 1.5 grams from seven grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty killer for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we'll press this out as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look a little bit darker
there with the, uh, how thick it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I guarantee you when we press out that
thicker piece, it's not going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: very different color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a tiny, tiny little bit darker,
but we'll do that later as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the second press too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the second press.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a unique second press in the sense of
not the, if we had gotten most of that out
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was only a little bit,
it almost protects itself when there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's less of it, you get this much
darker color that comes out of your rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second presses aren't usually very
exciting in particular if you've gotten 80
[SPEAKER_03]: to 90% out in the first press.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you've left, 66% it still comes
out pretty damn nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the pressure down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the temperature down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this next squish, we're going to
go for like a 1.3, 1.4 return on one
[SPEAKER_03]: squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have it in us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little squish right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say we probably got about a gram on
this one, maybe a tiny little bit less,
[SPEAKER_03]: like 0.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've still got another 0.4 to get out
of our second squish and we'll get a
[SPEAKER_03]: little more efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we would have left that for a
little bit longer, I think we would have
[SPEAKER_03]: seen her close to full return.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's pretty though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice color.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so more collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.4, 1.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just pulled like 21, 22% in a
squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the success we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we want to do right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see it's got a real terpy sort
of almost wet look to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of pulling snap texture to
it, but this is going to be butter in a
[SPEAKER_03]: day or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about 19 and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that was a great return.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.4 from seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, an absolute beautiful
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool that you can just go buy
flowers and produce a quality of rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max is going to collect this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we just pressed out a little bit
of our first batch there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hold that up to the camera real
nice and close.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put it close enough, it'll snap to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm about to take a dab of that
nice little slice of pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how Dom made it into a pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very nice touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that foamed up really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That almost looked like bubble hash when
it was... It stopped pretty quick in.
[SPEAKER_03]: About a second or two in, it turned to
just oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I kind of went to show you,
but it was like done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it foamed up nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Satiating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a piece of pie for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's not the right one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the right one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's mine actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: My last nugget, the tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have a cherry pie pizza party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many pieces of good things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that just foams up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks totally like foam out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it dissipates within two seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It dissipates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will help.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're friends forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna get in here for a piece of cherry
pie there, Dom?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did that ninja dab that was on
the... Oh, you did the ninja dab first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
Okay, well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back to pressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we are grabbing the third...
Third bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: Third bag of Teflon that we're about to
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last third pouch that we pressed was
actually 09 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is this one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dom's written all the information out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 09 top left corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.3 out of seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top right corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third pouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: First press, 60 seconds, 220 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've lowered the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dropping right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 213 as I speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna get it down to about 210.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 210 we're gonna probably press,
what do you guys think, for a minute,
[SPEAKER_03]: a minute 15?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think about a minute 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how it sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how it smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even... I mean, I pressed 200 or
210.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pressed 210 at two minutes and got my
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's always nice to figure out
your ratios without sacrificing that
[SPEAKER_03]: second round.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanna get as much as you can out of
that first round and get that really
[SPEAKER_03]: lovely color.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, hey, if you've left some
behind and it's more than a point,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely worth going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, why don't we put this one in?
Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Teflon Dawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of the kind of
buttery rosin that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really beautiful quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dom said right away, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I don't care about the yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the best press we've done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_03]: Going lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're just collecting this rosin and
laughing at the sliver that's good looking
[SPEAKER_03]: out, Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's proper right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we collected some lovely rosin here,
but this big sliver just came off in one
[SPEAKER_03]: piece and I thought that was pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll just drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max is about to load.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this our fifth pouch now?
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be our fifth squish,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is our fifth squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still at 210 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually down a little lower,
260 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, never a bad thing to go a little bit
lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going in for the straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the color of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of it's on here still, so we'll get
that off in the ... I mean, not lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but enough that we'll be collecting
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That buttery, sappy ...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just baked a cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cherry pie cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like cake batter rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you are, 4K.
[SPEAKER_03]: 4K of absolute buttery goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what kind of ... You guys
tighten the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we just produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really got to get the macro lens out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of good stuff going on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would have been a great thing for me to
shoot each one on the dabber, but so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more work.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going in with our fifth pouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought the temperature up to 211
degrees, 0.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that where you wanted it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly where we want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've got it right where we want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: 212 now it's up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give her a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're opening it up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: 215 degrees, pressed for about a minute
and 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see the squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it looks buttery and delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to pull that out for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, that looks real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll get that collected and do the
next squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we've got press number seven
here ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the 215 to 216 degree
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: In goes the pouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dom's working the compressor.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much I like a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look at these all we want,
but the way you'd really tell what are the
[SPEAKER_03]: best is by having them all, and which we
will all have, and we'll have to let each
[SPEAKER_03]: other know which ones we smoked first,
because that to me is the ultimate test.
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 more seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely more butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rogs and... Okay, so this is a second
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not too sure why.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an incredible quality off the last
hit, but it was only 0.4, and we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: getting pretty consistently like 1.1,
1.2 return.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.6, 0.7 on a lower end, but quite a few
that hit over 1.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead, Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One minute press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were wondering where the rest of it
went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny little blowout, but we'll collect
only the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little darker color, like what happens
with the second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks nicer out here than it did in there,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little bit of contaminant over on the
edges here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll avoid picking that up, but we'll
definitely... Very nice to have a big,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of those lenses over top of
it that elderly people use to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to have that for Rossum
collection, because you could really,
[SPEAKER_03]: with precision, avoid the contamination
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're doing our second pouch of the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had five pouches of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's four left.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number four, and we've got it at
212 degrees, and we're probably going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do about a minute to a minute and 45
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going for the butter,
so bring her down.
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a second or a first?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a first press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember... Ooh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can leave it right there, even.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just zoom in on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost a mixture, if you look at it here,
right in here in particular, you get this
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of buttery, live resin, dual thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like caking right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take it out and give it a
quick... All right, so we're throwing in
[SPEAKER_03]: another batch of 09 cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the temperature at 213.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hold up that last little batch
that we got, the one point... Was it 1.2?
[SPEAKER_03]: Top right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top right next to the other cooks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Way up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right up there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we got out of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.2 at a seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: First pouch, one minute and 45 seconds at
211.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took some really lovely macro shots
of this that I will, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: be sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get it up nice and close so you can
also see.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is some very nice quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been interesting, hasn't it,
guys, seeing all of the different kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: come up and see which ones make you drool
and make you like, oh, I want to hit that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a 10 degree difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a 10 degree difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an accidental squish on our third
pouch when I was pressing and squishing
[SPEAKER_03]: the Teflon and I accidentally grabbed an
09 Cooks and then this is the one we just
[SPEAKER_03]: pressed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quite a different texture, quite a
different color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's some different... Wow,
does that look amazing?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In she goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: 215 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going for a minute and 45 seconds,
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, again.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this up, that was a minute and 45
seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most translucent bake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out beautiful again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it outside and cool it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: That last one, for whatever reason,
at a minute and 45 seconds at 211 degrees,
[SPEAKER_03]: we came out with just 0.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.5 of a gram from a quarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's around like 10% a little below.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight and a half, nine percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to squeeze out another,
well, I would say probably 10% right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A minute and 14 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A minute and 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the second one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wasn't sure what you guys were
going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're opening up at a minute and 15
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what kind of squish we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely sells in nice color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a picture of these bubbles and
show them what that looks like under the
[SPEAKER_03]: macro lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our second last one going in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 211, 212 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: A minute and 45 seconds, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cake batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got our last pouch of the 09
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done well, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little collection of rosin squished
out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go over the numbers in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, we're back up, well, we're a
little below 210 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll probably leave this for a solid
minute and 45 seconds to two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't you guys say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get as much of that first yield
out as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hear it bubbling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's starting to taper off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fold it in half and get that pressed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a fairly low yield on that last
pouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.3 came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, still a minute and 45 seconds,
212 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where the consistency is
being lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not seeing it super often,
so it is an anomaly, but we are seeing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the, there's that yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want to grab that piece there?
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing worth saving.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was our last press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the 0.3?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got a, we got a 0.3 very low first
year of return, and then we hit it again
[SPEAKER_03]: for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks quite dark actually in this video
right now, but it's actually not as dark
[SPEAKER_03]: as it looks, but a little bit darker for
certain and a real nice smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice bouquet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got our 20% yield anyway,
and we managed to still get that 0.3
[SPEAKER_03]: separated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a nice lighter color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, yeah, we'll just get these
all lined up on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have to say about what we got
here?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did some squishing today,
a couple of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Top side over here, we got the 09 cookies
squared, and then at the bottom we got the
[SPEAKER_05]: Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is the top?
[SPEAKER_03]: Row that is three versus the top,
the second row in the top that is five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those all seconds?
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all our first presses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was the first poach, second poach,
third, fourth, fifth poach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first and second, we really were so
efficient that there was really no need
[SPEAKER_03]: for a second squish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were content with the yields on
those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones we, we figured there was
definitely more, more left in the pouches.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why there's second presses,
and those are the top three here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to give them a little bit of a
better idea, all the numbers written here,
[SPEAKER_03]: these are the second presses, these top
three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these are all first presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the accidental press that we did
during the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was one of the first buttery ones
that came out that we were really
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, some in-betweens on both of
these, and even this third one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little surprising when we only got the
0.3, but we squished out, although dark,
[SPEAKER_03]: still a damn near gram of, of nice rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down here, we've got the,
the cherry pie Teflon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, cherry pie cross with a wifi alien OG
and 09 cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pie gave it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all the first presses on top
or no?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a, that's a second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks really good for a second press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first press.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first, this first,
this one came out and we were just so
[SPEAKER_03]: happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the color on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one, 0.6 on that one, but a second
press of 0.6, much darker color.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil Soil Grown Sal absolutely told us
that we would notice that very lovely
[SPEAKER_03]: peach-esque color on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.9, no second press on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our 0.4 also came out very nice
color, even lighter than the one,
[SPEAKER_03]: the peachy orange one, but more lemony and
yellow-esque.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that is a 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys say that we each pick one
to dab on and finish this video?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the one that Max is choosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see a finely buttered with mild
shatter consistency to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A first bag, a second bag, first press
minute and 45 seconds, 211 Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.2 out of seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no second press on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one Max is going to pick.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Max is going to take his rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a lovely foam to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the 0.9 Cooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.9 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.9 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consistent with the flower taste that
you're used to?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the color of it was really nice too
when it was actually foaming.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very light.
[SPEAKER_06]: It foamed up light brown for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try and show you that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 0.9 Cookies is strong too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got quite a lot worse part to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Dom, which one are you picking?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go with the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to go with the third pouch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going base purely off looks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a really nice buttery batch out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to squeeze off a piece of
that bar or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what I'm going to go for
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, it's on.
Secured.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to catch the foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Max coughing for Dom's hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bros.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still feeling that 0.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it is my choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough choice that it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to kind of puff on all of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I think I am going to go for
the 0.4 Teflon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's one of the brightest actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: She came off nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's definitely active.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbers nearby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste was on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strong for certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really tasted that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the way that mildly
shattery in between butter, raws and rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to grab you a little differently
than the turp rich butter, which also,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say which one is better,
but it's just personal preference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went for that one because of its
shininess and its color.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, super big shout out to soil grown
Sal for the Sasquatch Rosin Press and his
[SPEAKER_03]: whole team over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely top notch tool gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really looking forward to the V2,
which is out really right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, thanks to Max and Dom from
Sunrise Wellness Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the wonderful growers that produce the
bud that we process today through the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosin Press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, thank you guys for watching
Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pleasure to have these guys over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
