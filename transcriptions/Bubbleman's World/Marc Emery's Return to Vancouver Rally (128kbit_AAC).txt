[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at Victory Square Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's marijuana man announcing someone
lost their keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're 15 minutes into the day and
someone's already lost their keys,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Jeff from Skunk is here from
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Enrico Bouchard from The Sublimator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a whole crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you guys come on down to Victory
Square today and check out Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's freshly released from prison and
welcome back to Vancouver experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm going to be dabbing him the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's time to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marlon Asher's singing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hit this La Fumo pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've actually ever hit one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the only music here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought the tunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here at the Mark Emery Celebration
Victory Square.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Ann?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasty bar of full melt dry sip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the first full melt dry sip?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got another couple hours before Mark
arrives, but we're going to walk through
[SPEAKER_03]: the crowd and talk to some of the
characters that are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know David Malmolabine will be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Greg, marijuana man is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll see the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring the power?
[SPEAKER_05]: Half an hour done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff gets love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already mentioned Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You walked over and said hi to the crew
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's in from Saskatchewan from Prairie
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: He throws the Prairie Skunk, the Prairie
Cup in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be at actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a booth and my good buddy Stu.
[SPEAKER_03]: What band is Stu from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice Mate?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a metal band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good metal band.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be representing Bubble Bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clap back in the house with his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Wilcox, extraordinaire activist.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you feeling today, buddy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark's home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, is this like for the first time?
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't been doing something that has
to do with the coalition?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cannabis Canada Society has always
been about independent media and if people
[SPEAKER_10]: look on our channel, we have Mark's
interview, very last interview before he
[SPEAKER_10]: went in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to see him in jail at Surrey Pre
Trial.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh sorry, Coquitlam Pre Trial and actually
filmed the visual outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm very excited to see him come home
because Jody and his crew has held it down
[SPEAKER_10]: and everybody here just once again
represents the BC Unity and that's what
[SPEAKER_10]: this is all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, one love, one plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a good vibe being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait to see him step square.
[SPEAKER_03]: Step into the square and hear everyone
erupt.
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody does not give this man respect
for doing the time he's done for the
[SPEAKER_10]: culture, then you don't belong in the
culture because really this is what it's
[SPEAKER_10]: about.
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, Mark to me is now a martyr and
yeah, I have a lot of respect for the man
[SPEAKER_10]: so there's nothing more I can say other
than I'm here to support him and to
[SPEAKER_10]: comfort as well just like Mark is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, respect, Jason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect, brother.
Thanks.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guppies in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've missed you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're so happy that you're back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just looking forward to the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy, you have done such awesome stuff and
wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see all the good shit that you
started.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks brother man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks Guppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a man who did this for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We sold thieves every country,
every town, every crossroad in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: We shipped them out by the million.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mark gave all the money away.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gave it to every initiative that was
going at the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We sent money to Colorado to get their
initiative started.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've legalized where we want it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're using the very seeds that we
mailed to them to sell legally now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington state, same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mailed seeds to every town and city in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of the rest of them too.
[SPEAKER_14]: California's next.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alaska's next.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're falling by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it didn't happen in the United States
like it is right now until they arrested
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as he went into the belly of the
beast, it began to change.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, the very man who brought the
charges against us in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_14]: John McKay is his name, the prosecutor,
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as he arrested Mark Emery and put
him away, he changed sides.
[SPEAKER_14]: He then went to lobby for the legalization
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: The very man who put him in jail.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how much influence and effect Mark
has on people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm very proud to have worked with him
and stood by his side all these years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to know that we can continue to grow
and grow and that legalization may well be
[SPEAKER_14]: at our doorstep.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's happening in these places.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, when you talk about legalization in
Colorado and Washington state,
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah, yeah, they're all excited about it,
but they're excited about it because of
[SPEAKER_14]: the tax dollars we're getting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not because it was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: The voters forced them to then thank God
that American citizens have the right to
[SPEAKER_14]: vote for things that they want.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have that right here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dana Larson, our very good friend,
mounted his campaign with Sensible BC and
[SPEAKER_14]: that was a referendum.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to get 400,000 signatures for God
sakes, just in British Columbia alone.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need a tenth of that to get it
on a ballot in the United States.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank God that those people have got
that right and that the people who run
[SPEAKER_14]: their government respect that right.
[SPEAKER_14]: The governor of Colorado did not want to
legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: He fought against it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when the people voted, he said,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You said that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: But because of the amount of taxes and the
reaping off this stuff, that's why
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody else wants to legalize it too,
including Canada, at least part of Canada,
[SPEAKER_14]: the sensible part of Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Trudeau, as we all know,
has come out and said that he and the
[SPEAKER_14]: Liberal Party will legalize marijuana if
they get in power.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a platform clearly written on
their webpage.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go and read their ideas about how
they'd like to legalize.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, it's tricky for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been at this a long time and we're
hardcore pot smokers, hardcore
[SPEAKER_14]: legalization advocates, and there's many
things that we would like to see done
[SPEAKER_14]: quite differently, I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing that I've found about the
legalization that's going on right now is
[SPEAKER_14]: that they are not looking at marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't looked at the plant yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've only looked at prohibition and
what prohibition has said about the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the rules and regulations that
anyone would want to advance around
[SPEAKER_14]: marijuana is only because of some bad
thing they heard about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no evidence to suggest in my life
that there's anything bad with it yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if I was a politician, given the task
of legalizing marijuana in our society,
[SPEAKER_14]: wouldn't I go and look at what that
substance was?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've just taken for granted that it's
got to be dangerous, because that's what
[SPEAKER_14]: prohibition has said for our entire lives.
[SPEAKER_14]: People who don't smoke marijuana have only
got their information from prohibition.
[SPEAKER_14]: Prohibition has always, always had a
vested interest in making sure that people
[SPEAKER_14]: thought marijuana was bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way that the police and the
government and the law societies and the
[SPEAKER_14]: courts could get the kind of money they've
been given around this substance if they
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't continually, day after day,
say that it's dangerous and bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what they've done.
[SPEAKER_14]: No one ever came and asked me.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you saw a report about somebody being
busted in the newspaper for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_14]: information came from the police every
single time and time again.
[SPEAKER_14]: No one else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So all of the information that all of us
know, quite frankly here today,
[SPEAKER_14]: is only what we've heard.
[SPEAKER_14]: No science has been done anywhere,
not anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've not been allowed to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly not in the United States.
[SPEAKER_14]: The DEA, the police, have said you can't
have this plant to look at.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's dangerous, but you can't look at it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dangerous, can't look at it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we are in the cannabis culture
smoking weed our whole lives, knowing
[SPEAKER_14]: either from our own experience or the
experience of our friends that there's
[SPEAKER_14]: something possibly quite good about this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not seeing a lot of that,
so here we sit for all these years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm damn near 60, been smoking joints
since I was 14.
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the end of the day, we're left with
a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go, hey, my buddy says this helps him
with his epilepsy or his glaucoma or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to know why.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what we say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, why is it doing this?
[SPEAKER_14]: And they go, well, you can't look at the
plant if it does.
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_14]: That is so bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that the legalization of
cannabis here in our world is going to
[SPEAKER_14]: show all of the people who don't know
anything about cannabis just how bad it's
[SPEAKER_14]: been.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to say, what?
[SPEAKER_14]: You've hidden this plant that might have
had therapeutic value?
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen harder.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can probably turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too loud.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't touch anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, where was I?
[SPEAKER_05]: You were lighting that joint.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So good BC budget.
[SPEAKER_14]: So my point was going to be that upon the
liberals wanting to advance the notion of
[SPEAKER_14]: legalizing marijuana, I'm going to vote
for them.
[SPEAKER_14]: I signed up for their party right away as
soon as I heard it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care which party says it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody said it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a real platform saying that we
want to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: NDP said it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd sign up for them.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about politics.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about politicians and how
wicked that is.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're going to do wicked things that
I don't agree with no matter who they are.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that party, the liberal party,
has said, we'll legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm behind that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have the rest of the shit done some
other time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So my point still is to advance the
notion.
[SPEAKER_14]: When they say, OK, hey, now we're in power
to legalize marijuana, we're going to say,
[SPEAKER_14]: hey, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do this right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do it right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, in my heart, believe that all of
the restrictions that they have in
[SPEAKER_14]: Colorado and Washington need to be levied
on this plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no evidence for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want them to go find evidence-based
information and use that to bring this
[SPEAKER_14]: into my world safely and legally.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be able to sell weed right over
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to have to be a billionaire
to get a license to sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want every one of you people to be able
to grow and sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you need to get a license to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what?
[SPEAKER_14]: But it shouldn't be just for the rich.
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: So keep that in mind when it comes right
down to them asking questions about
[SPEAKER_14]: legalizing pot, because they're going to
be prepared willy-nilly to go with all of
[SPEAKER_14]: the bad stuff that they heard about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the fire department.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a few other people in the house
that would like to say hello to you too,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me go find one of them for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Longtime supporter, Mr. Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a wonderful day today to get stoned
in the park and wait for the principal to
[SPEAKER_16]: come home.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been an incredible four or five years
since Mark's been gone.
[SPEAKER_16]: So many things have happened in Canada and
around the world to advance the marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: cause.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so much of that is because of the
seeds that Mark planted in the 90s and the
[SPEAKER_16]: early 2000s that are now blossoming with
the harvest of freedom.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been working to help legalize
marijuana for over two decades now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've met all kinds of people across
this country who have devoted so much of
[SPEAKER_16]: their life and their money and their
energy to changing these laws,
[SPEAKER_16]: to liberating our plant and the culture
that surrounds it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so many people have worked so hard.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, Mark Embry was a big
inspiration for so many people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mark is someone who led by example,
who went out there, put his own freedom,
[SPEAKER_16]: his own money on the line to make these
changes happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's paid that price of four and a
half years in American prison,
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as many other raids and challenges
long before that.
[SPEAKER_16]: The VPD used to come down to Mark's MPC
store and take all his bongs and pipes on
[SPEAKER_16]: a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_16]: But he would reopen the next day.
[SPEAKER_16]: He would struggle to get out of the debt
that all that loss had gotten him into.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he would keep going and keep going and
not stop.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have met so many people who have
followed Mark's example and who have given
[SPEAKER_16]: of their own time and risked and lost
their own freedom to change these laws
[SPEAKER_16]: that have caused so much harm and so much
destruction all across our country to so
[SPEAKER_16]: many innocent people and families that
have been torn apart by the terrible
[SPEAKER_16]: destruction of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_16]: And these laws are going to change.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to change these laws.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have made so much progress over the
last two decades.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when we started this crusade,
it was almost impossible to buy a bong or
[SPEAKER_16]: a pipe anywhere in Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: You couldn't get High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_16]: Grow books were banned.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our culture was entirely censored and
forbidden.
[SPEAKER_16]: Never mind a medical marijuana dispensary
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But over the last 20 years, we have gotten
the government to legalize hemp.
[SPEAKER_16]: And now hemp has been grown across our
country.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got hundreds of stores that are
selling bongs and pipes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Petro Canada stations now sell bongs and
pipes in our country.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those laws are still on the books.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bongs and pipes are still illegal in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: You might not know that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still against the law.
[SPEAKER_16]: And every once a year or so, some head
shop in a small town somewhere pays the
[SPEAKER_16]: price and gets busted.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for the most part, we have managed to
get those laws ignored all across this
[SPEAKER_16]: country.
[SPEAKER_16]: And over the last couple of years,
we've seen an incredible expansion in the
[SPEAKER_16]: dispensary and compassion club movement
here in Vancouver and across Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's over 40 places where you can go
now and buy medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_16]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we accomplished these things with
civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there's all kinds of tactics
that we need to use to change this law.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to vote.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to talk to our friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to educate people.
[SPEAKER_16]: But civil disobedience has been our most
successful tactic over the years of just
[SPEAKER_16]: acting like it's already legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of just ignoring these laws and creating
the world we want to see by opening stores
[SPEAKER_16]: and businesses, by smoking loud and proud,
by not being ashamed of who we are,
[SPEAKER_16]: but being proud of being cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you light up a joint, you are
engaging in a tradition that human beings
[SPEAKER_16]: have been doing since before recorded
history.
[SPEAKER_16]: People have been using this most wonderful
appliance for thousands and thousands and
[SPEAKER_16]: tens of thousands of years all across the
planet.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know how wonderful this plant is.
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that cannabis is the world's
greatest plant and that no other plant can
[SPEAKER_16]: do the things that cannabis can do.
[SPEAKER_16]: If it just got me high and made me feel
warm and fuzzy inside, that would be
[SPEAKER_16]: enough.
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be enough for me to want this
plant to be totally legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, over the years, we've
learned how much other wonderful things we
[SPEAKER_16]: can do.
[SPEAKER_16]: And isn't it strange?
[SPEAKER_16]: That the same plant that can make us feel
good, the same plant that can cure so many
[SPEAKER_16]: of our ailments, the plant that when you
eat it or when you smoke it or hell,
[SPEAKER_16]: when you put it in a cream and rub it on
your skin, it provides amazing medicinal
[SPEAKER_16]: benefits and relieves the pain and
suffering of hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_16]: people all across this country.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what a miracle that this exact same
plant is also an incredible source of
[SPEAKER_16]: paper, of fire, of fiber, of fuel,
that we can eat the seeds of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: plant and have it nourish us and refresh
us and give us exactly the protein and
[SPEAKER_16]: oils that we need to be healthy human
beings.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a reason we have the cannabis
plant and there's a reason we love this
[SPEAKER_16]: plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've always been so amazed that so
many Canadians love this plant and that
[SPEAKER_16]: we're fighting for a plant for something
that grows out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_16]: The most natural thing there can be on
this earth.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that every single nation on earth has
prohibited this plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that we've been fighting this war in
Canada for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_16]: But this century has been a century of
prohibition and of marijuana and the other
[SPEAKER_16]: sacred, useful plants too, let me say,
all being banned and forbidden by the
[SPEAKER_16]: Canadian government and by governments all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I tell you, when our children and
grandchildren and great-grandchildren open
[SPEAKER_16]: their history books and when they look
back and read and learn about this century
[SPEAKER_16]: of prohibition, they will be amazed at the
ignorance of our society.
[SPEAKER_16]: They will be amazed at the plant that they
now use every single day to eat,
[SPEAKER_16]: as medicine, to build their house,
to fuel their car, to clothe their body.
[SPEAKER_16]: They will be shocked that this plant was
banned for a hundred years in Canada and
[SPEAKER_16]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they will wonder what the hell were we
thinking to make this useful plant
[SPEAKER_16]: illegal?
[SPEAKER_16]: And to put hundreds of thousands of
Canadians in prison to arrest over two
[SPEAKER_16]: million Canadians for marijuana possession
over the years.
[SPEAKER_16]: What a waste of energy and resources.
[SPEAKER_16]: What a terribly destructive, pointless
battle the police and our governments have
[SPEAKER_16]: been fighting against everyday citizens
who just want to smoke a little weed,
[SPEAKER_16]: who just want to enjoy a plant that grows
naturally out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_16]: What a terrible waste it has been.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we are doing here, our cause,
our movement to end this destructive
[SPEAKER_16]: prohibition and this war on marijuana,
it is historic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't forget, the actions we are taking
will resonate through the future and when
[SPEAKER_16]: we change these laws, that will be a day
that future generations look back with
[SPEAKER_16]: with pride and celebrate that there were
Canadians brave enough and strong enough
[SPEAKER_16]: to get out there and to selflessly fight
against this prohibition so that every
[SPEAKER_16]: single Canadian and every single human
being on this planet earth can have access
[SPEAKER_16]: to this wonderful plant and the benefits
that it gives.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that every single human being who needs
marijuana medicine has access to it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we are no longer wasting our
police, our courts, our prisons and human
[SPEAKER_16]: lives in this destructive, terrible battle
against the wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have come a long way over these
past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I was saying, we've got hemp
legalized in Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got bongs and pipes and other ways
to consume cannabis widely available and
[SPEAKER_16]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got dispensaries and head shops and
businesses that cater to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: Vapor lounges are opening up across the
country.
[SPEAKER_16]: In many ways we have never had it so good
as the marijuana movement as we have it
[SPEAKER_16]: now.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have to change the laws.
[SPEAKER_16]: All of that can be taken away.
[SPEAKER_16]: All of that can be lost if we do not get
those laws changed.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can make those changes happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: If we defeat Stephen Harper at our next
federal election, we will see legalization
[SPEAKER_16]: come to Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: Canadians are ready for legalization.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we started this crusade 20 years ago,
a majority of Canadians did not want to
[SPEAKER_16]: see marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't want to legalize.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our country was shrouded in ignorance.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now knowledge has gotten out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: People are far more aware.
[SPEAKER_16]: They see the benefits of cannabis in all
of its forms.
[SPEAKER_16]: And a growing majority of Canadians wants
to see prohibition end.
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to see this plant legalized for
medical use and for recreational use and
[SPEAKER_16]: for social use and for all the wonderful
benefits it can bring.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are almost there.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are so close.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now is the time to push harder.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now is the time to get together.
[SPEAKER_16]: To make that final push to get over the
top.
[SPEAKER_16]: They did it in Washington.
[SPEAKER_16]: They did it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: They are going to do it this fall in
Alaska, in Oregon, in Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_16]: I always thought Canada was going to
legalize marijuana first.
[SPEAKER_16]: I always thought Canada was going to
legalize marijuana first.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we haven't.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we are going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now that it's crumbling in America,
now that other countries around the world
[SPEAKER_16]: are rejecting marijuana prohibition,
whoever really heard of Uruguay before the
[SPEAKER_16]: last couple of months, who could even find
that country on a map?
[SPEAKER_16]: But that small country is changing the
world with their bravery and their action
[SPEAKER_16]: to change these laws.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana users all around the world are
talking about Uruguay and what's happening
[SPEAKER_16]: there.
[SPEAKER_16]: If we do this in Canada, right next to the
U.S., if Canada ends marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: prohibition, and legalizes marijuana,
that will be the death knell for
[SPEAKER_16]: prohibition in America and around the
world.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time for us to make this final push
to get over the top and to change these
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got a wonderful example in Mark
Emory, our Prince of Pot, someone who gave
[SPEAKER_16]: up his freedom, someone who gave up $4
million that he donated to the marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: movement.
[SPEAKER_16]: And many hundreds of thousands of dollars
more that the police came and stole in
[SPEAKER_16]: merchandise from his store over the years.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we've made those changes happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here in Vancouver, with the help of Mark
Emory and other activists, we have helped
[SPEAKER_16]: change the marijuana laws all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been a wonderful example.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Mason Tavert, one of the guys
who was basically right behind the
[SPEAKER_16]: legalization in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's actually going to be coming up
here in October for our sensible B.C.
convention.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was the guy who helped legalize it in
Colorado and in Denver.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he, like many other Americans,
got some of his initial money and funding
[SPEAKER_16]: and was inspired by Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, we've had an influence
around the world and across this country
[SPEAKER_16]: that we may not realize what a profound
impact we have had.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we can't leave it all to Mark and to
other activists.
[SPEAKER_16]: Every single person has to get involved.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're here today, it's because you
love marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because you want to see marijuana
legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you got to do a little more than just
showing up today.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a really good start.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm so happy and thrilled to see such
a crowd.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you got to do more.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want you to spend at least 15 minutes
every day trying to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you can do that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Spend that time talking to someone who
doesn't believe it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: Spend that time donating the money you
earn in that time period to the
[SPEAKER_16]: legalization cause.
[SPEAKER_16]: Spend that time writing a letter to the
editor telling them why the article they
[SPEAKER_16]: ran against marijuana was bullshit and why
it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: Spend that time coming down to the
sensible B.C.
[SPEAKER_16]: office and helping us do data entry or
make phone calls or build our group.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot that you can do.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want every single one of you to be
able to tell your kids and grandkids when
[SPEAKER_16]: they're looking back, when they're reading
in the history books about marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: prohibition, I want you to be able to say,
yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_16]: I did something.
[SPEAKER_16]: I made a difference.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was because of me and people like me
that you never have to know what it is to
[SPEAKER_16]: be arrested for what herbal medicine you
use or for what plants you choose to grow
[SPEAKER_16]: in your garden.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can end this prohibition, but only if
we all work together.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope you will all pledge now to do
more to make these laws change,
[SPEAKER_16]: to vote and defeat Stephen Harper and
bring in a government that will legalize
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana for all Canadians.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do that together.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can make that change happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And like I said, when we change it in
Canada, it will be the spark that changes
[SPEAKER_16]: these laws all around the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a historic time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our time has come.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's seize the moment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's make these changes so that future
generations never have to worry about
[SPEAKER_16]: prohibition again.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so very much for being here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks to Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, spend 15 minutes a day or at very
least go out and vote one time,
[SPEAKER_14]: one day, vote for the liberals.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're killing time till Mark Emery
gets here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very exciting times and we hope that Mark
is going to inspire us and continue to
[SPEAKER_14]: inspire us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we will move forward towards a day
when it is legal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Although we're very lucky here in
Vancouver, I gotta say, to be able to sit
[SPEAKER_14]: in a park like this today, smoke pot
openly and yak on about stuff out loud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody said nothing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We never asked for any permission to be
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't ask for any permission to do
420 or cannabis day.
[SPEAKER_14]: We take over the spot because we're
protesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Today is a protest as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't get away from protesting because
prohibition isn't over yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, uh, where'd Jeff go?
[SPEAKER_14]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to bring this fellow in.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ours comes all the way out from
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's leading the fight against prohibition
out there and doing some wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Has a great, fun cup every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll get him to tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: His name is Jeff Lindstrom.
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll get it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took Mark and Jody three years to
remember my name.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, you know, I'm Jeff from
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the Spunk Fun Guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I host the Prairie Medicinal.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the Harvest Cup in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our fourth annual.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ain't ever been there, it's a
party.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also got a head shop on the Prairie.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Skunk Funk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hence why I'm the Skunk Funk Guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I come out to Vancouver pretty much
all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Dana was talking about how people get
inspired and that's exactly what Mark
[SPEAKER_12]: Embry does.
[SPEAKER_12]: He inspires people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, he certainly inspired me to get
started.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, opening my head shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you guys have ever read
their article.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an article he wrote, uh,
how to open your own head shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, it gives you the information about how
to get going, but not really who to talk
[SPEAKER_12]: to.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that door, you got to open on your own
and it takes a lot of hard work,
[SPEAKER_12]: but that's what activism and that's where
it starts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the inspiration of what people do
to get you going and get you loving what
[SPEAKER_12]: you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now what I've done is I've gotten
licensed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I grow medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a full license.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on the old program, not the new
program.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I still grow weed, real medicine for real
patients, people who are sick that need
[SPEAKER_12]: help.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what my cannabis cup is about.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what our activism is about.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what all the hard work we all do is
about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I'm here today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, I wish Mark was here,
but I'm so glad he's home and we're just
[SPEAKER_12]: going to go harder and stronger now that
he's back.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate all the hard work that every
single person that helped to get me where
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm standing here talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Without any of these guys, Dana,
Mark, Jeremiah, Greg Williams,
[SPEAKER_12]: Michelle Rainey, Mark Arenda, the list
goes on, Redbeard Glass, everybody
[SPEAKER_12]: involved in the wholesale industry,
the cannabis culture industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: All those people put their heart and soul
on the line for you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to start with step up,
get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we can change this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Politically, let the powers that be know
that we don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to keep smoking every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I promise that I'll be right there
with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you want to party and get real
stoned, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,
[SPEAKER_12]: September 26th, 27th, 28th, the Prairie
Minister Harvest Cup, and that's the place
[SPEAKER_12]: to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I almost like this join out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys want to smoke with me?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they like that shit up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to plug a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're looking, sasburycup.ca is our
website if you want to get involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also got an email, sasburycup.gmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you can contact me at skunkfunk,
smokers and porn at Saskatoon,
[SPEAKER_12]: Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, you can catch me pretty much
online on POT.TV or hanging out with these
[SPEAKER_12]: crazy people getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll smoke with any one of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Take an example that the fight is going on
everywhere across Canada, not just here,
[SPEAKER_14]: not just today, but all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got good friends in Toronto that are
working hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: People across the land that we hear from
that are fighting a good fight.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, fighting a good fight has gone on
here a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to introduce a guy to you
who's been here for just about all of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Magnuson is a long time activist
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: He helps us immeasurably with all of our
stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he'd like to say a couple of words to
you now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, Manjula.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all for coming out.
[SPEAKER_17]: What a wonderful looking crowd.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're here because we're going to
celebrate the March 3, except March not
[SPEAKER_17]: pre.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not pre.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why it is a protest.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mark's coming home to work on all of us
being free like he did for most of his
[SPEAKER_17]: life and many of us have done for the last
quite a while here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this isn't just about smoking weed
and all the wonderful things that Dana
[SPEAKER_17]: Larson was so eloquent in telling you all
about.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not just about smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: What this is really about is who gets to
own who and tell who what to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the answer is your parents get to tell
you what to do and what not to do for a
[SPEAKER_17]: while.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when that event is over and you rise
to that position where you say thank you
[SPEAKER_17]: mom and dad or whoever's your guardian,
I appreciate your values.
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate what you did for me,
but I'm a different person than you and
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not 100% on everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now I'm going to go do what I want to
do and not do what I don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what freedom is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're really supposed to have it here.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a very unique experiment in
freedom supposedly with public servants.
[SPEAKER_17]: You see we don't have dictators and
tyrants here anymore.
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have sparrows and kings and
military takeovers or people with just
[SPEAKER_17]: enough might to get away with doing what
isn't right.
[SPEAKER_17]: What we're supposed to have are public
servants and their role is to make sure
[SPEAKER_17]: that every individual in Canada gets to be
whoever they want to be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Do whatever they want to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't do whatever they don't want to do
unless they're harming someone.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're harming somebody else in your
actions and it's demonstrable and
[SPEAKER_17]: significant, then it is the responsibility
of all of us to make sure that doesn't
[SPEAKER_17]: happen as best we can within our powers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And here in a democracy with public
servants, we have trained police officers
[SPEAKER_17]: armed with so many more things than just
guns.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're there to keep the peace and they
have no trouble doing that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of the time, but instead their job is
about making sure we don't have what the
[SPEAKER_17]: corporations and the gangs don't want us
to have on our own unless we got it from
[SPEAKER_17]: them.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just as wrong as can be.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just the antics of freedom.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is upside down and backwards that
Mark went to jail for fighting for freedom
[SPEAKER_17]: by selling flower seeds, medicinal flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a travesty that happened to Mark
Emery.
[SPEAKER_17]: They know this war against marijuana is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_17]: They know whose rights they're protecting.
[SPEAKER_17]: They know that innocent people are being
harmed every day.
[SPEAKER_17]: By these laws and yet they continue and
they're taking our money as payment to
[SPEAKER_17]: continue that.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's as criminal as it can get.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're supposed to have the principles of
fundamental justice determining what
[SPEAKER_17]: happens here.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's in the Charter.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pierre Elliott Trudeau goes on in the
preamble about how we take these things
[SPEAKER_17]: for granted, these principles of
fundamental justice.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're not hard or complicated.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like you're innocent until they
prove you guilty.
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's evidence that you've done
significant demonstrable harm to somebody
[SPEAKER_17]: else, then you can be brought before an
adjudicator, but you're still innocent as
[SPEAKER_17]: you stand there.
[SPEAKER_17]: When they properly present evidence on one
side of a set of scales that proves you
[SPEAKER_17]: did some harm and how much that weighs
that down and that you intended to do it,
[SPEAKER_17]: then they can give you a penalty that
balances the scales on the other side.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know those scales held by that older
blindfolded woman that represents what
[SPEAKER_17]: justice is supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_17]: So how has it become that you can stand
before this adjudicator and get a penalty
[SPEAKER_17]: for having possession of a God-given
natural herb that you thought was going to
[SPEAKER_17]: help make you feel better or give you some
pleasure?
[SPEAKER_17]: How is that a crime?
[SPEAKER_17]: How do we allow that to be a crime?
[SPEAKER_17]: Data asked you for 15 minutes of your
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you it's a lifetime thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's from the time you wake up in the
morning till the time you go to bed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's your duty as part of this crew to win
our freedom back from these corporate and
[SPEAKER_17]: financial elite who have kidnapped us.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's nothing better you can do with
your time either.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing that feels better than
throwing wrenches in the gears of these
[SPEAKER_17]: people.
[SPEAKER_17]: They think they own our houses.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marijuana for me is just a symbol and the
prohibition of marijuana is a symbol about
[SPEAKER_17]: how we're not free.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because for me it's about freedom.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I really want.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let everybody be who everybody is and
don't bother them unless they're bothering
[SPEAKER_17]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_17]: Not on my dime.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't bother them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marijuana is my issue because this is the
most obvious and glaring example of how
[SPEAKER_17]: we're not free.
[SPEAKER_17]: This magnificent herb that has been living
with us side by side on this planet for
[SPEAKER_17]: eons has become part of our bodies and our
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've used it like the natives used the
buffalo and we use the whales for every
[SPEAKER_17]: little thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: The people selling stuff that people want,
point them to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: prison system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not even in prison can they keep the drug
business out of business.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is always in business.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is what you've got to start with.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, here are the two consequences.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I told you the two facts that people
like me have to understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: One is that there's always some people who
want cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other is that there will always be
somebody making money supplying it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get those two points across.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really don't think there's any way
they can deny those things are true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now here are the consequences.
[SPEAKER_13]: One, if you make something illegal,
all the money in that business goes to
[SPEAKER_13]: criminals.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the prohibition does, it does not stop
the business, it gives all the money to
[SPEAKER_13]: criminals.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the first thing prohibition does.
[SPEAKER_13]: Second consequence, the business is
operated with violence, murder,
[SPEAKER_13]: and crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is what prohibition does.
[SPEAKER_13]: The only consequences of prohibition is
not less drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what people think.
[SPEAKER_13]: The people like me think prohibition means
less drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: All that prohibition means is that the
people running the business are criminals
[SPEAKER_13]: and they run it with beatings,
murder, arson, and crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is all the consequences of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rich criminals, lots of crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's the finish after those two
consequences.
[SPEAKER_13]: And here's where I talk to the people like
me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every politician who maintains prohibition
supports gangsters.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every politician who maintains prohibition
creates crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll say it again, every politician who
supports prohibition supports gangsters.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every politician who supports prohibition
creates crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, all you people out there like me,
all you people who believe prohibition,
[SPEAKER_13]: who still believe prohibition is a good
thing, which I believed until I was nearly
[SPEAKER_13]: 40, all of you who believe prohibition is
a good thing, next thing I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_13]: you're going to think I'm not just wrong
but insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I would have said 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you work on this, if you look at
the real information, if you look at what
[SPEAKER_13]: really happens, sooner or later you will
wake up and you will know that what I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: about to say is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want less crime, if you want
gangsters to be weakened and out of
[SPEAKER_13]: business, if you want better control over
who can access drugs, if you want less
[SPEAKER_13]: drugs in school, less drugs available to
children, if you want all those things,
[SPEAKER_13]: you must support legalization and
regulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no other way.
[SPEAKER_13]: None.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to finish with a quote from
what Neil just said.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, I'm not in a cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hardly ever smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Used to think it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've been paying taxes for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been paying plenty of taxes for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Neil said, you, the government,
you don't harass all of these people on my
[SPEAKER_13]: dime.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the one paying.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the taxpayer.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the people like me are the taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been wasting my money as long as
I've been paying taxes on harassing
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sick and bloody tired of it and
I'm going to make it stop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Leap, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: Guy in a suit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Only one here.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks a lot, Steve.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we're just killing time here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still dealing with some electrical
issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the mic goes dead, don't be alarmed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of stuff gets said about Mark Emery
over the years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly an awful lot in the news
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_14]: Him and Jody are out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here because he inspired me something
fierce.
[SPEAKER_14]: The things that I have experienced with
this man is truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's one of the most truly amazing
people that I think I've ever met in my
life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one story that I'd like to share with
you is I don't even remember the year,
[SPEAKER_14]: but our friends, the Blunt Brothers'
building burned down to the ground on a
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunday or something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all came down and we all gathered
around.
[SPEAKER_14]: The building was hugely ablaze.
[SPEAKER_14]: It could not be saved.
[SPEAKER_14]: Much damage to our building too with the
smoke and the water and so forth.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all thought we were out of jobs and out
of business.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mark said, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, people are coming here and they
want to know that we're open.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he said, we're going to clean it and
paint it and clean it and clean it and
[SPEAKER_14]: paint it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sold seeds on the street.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had no power in the building.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was all damaged.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had to scurry in there and fill the
seed orders.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had some chairs and tables out
front.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was that night that it inspired me
because our store had to be left wide open
[SPEAKER_14]: because of the damage and fire regulations
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mark sat out here all night protecting
that store.
[SPEAKER_14]: Two nights in a row he did that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do anything for him.
[SPEAKER_14]: See a man do that and give it all away.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was so good at generating things that
could help our cause and give money to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a lot of money in those days.
[SPEAKER_14]: Selling the seeds was good for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he used it to the fullest extent.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a hundred other stories really
of those same kinds of things where he is
[SPEAKER_14]: a selfless man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrogance, they say, oh he's so arrogant.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you go, come on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we all have to have a big ego.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're standing here up against the man.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us saying you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a big ego.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's depressed and his naysayers and
all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: They never stop talking about him in the
meantime.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to see if we can feed in a
little music here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just relax out a little bit and maybe we
get some live.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a couple of musicians in the
house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe get some live together too before
our power runs out.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're waiting on a generator.
[SPEAKER_14]: So enjoy.
I
[SPEAKER_00]: am a German man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble man here backstage at the Victory
Square Mark Emery celebration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bumping prophecy over the speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time anyone here has ever heard
prophecy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're digging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timmy!
How's it
[SPEAKER_04]: going David?
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were actually waving to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were behind him and you were waving to
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh I just sounded weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think of the prophecy
you're singing right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the train right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a bumpin tune dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a funny dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a pig.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like a pot-bellied pig.
[SPEAKER_15]: She thought it was a pig.
[SPEAKER_15]: In Edmonton they'll beat you up for pipe
resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or at least back when I was living there
they did.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Edmonton was nicknamed Harshmonton
because you could look all day for hashish
[SPEAKER_15]: and not find any.
[SPEAKER_15]: So much so that you start to see people
writing big black markers on the
[SPEAKER_15]: washrooms.
[SPEAKER_15]: Walls.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's the hash?
[SPEAKER_15]: We had hash droughts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And nobody ever had any but.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was that bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in Edmonton, back in 1993 when I
started doing civil disobedience,
[SPEAKER_15]: there weren't that many pot activists
around.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was mostly teenagers that helped me
organize the rallies and protests.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we heard about this guy named
Mark Emory who was making big moves in
[SPEAKER_15]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: He flew me out here in 95 to be his
in-house rabble rouser.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I normally, being a libertarian
socialist, I was suspicious of all the
[SPEAKER_15]: capitalists around me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought they were just in it for the
money.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was reluctant to trust Mark Emory
because I thought he was just another
[SPEAKER_15]: capitalist.
[SPEAKER_15]: But he showed me what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was hiring a whole bunch of anarchists
to create the world we wanted to live in
[SPEAKER_15]: and then defend it with our bodies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, right on!
[SPEAKER_15]: Because all the people I knew in Edmonton
who had money were cowards.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one hip store and the guy didn't
want anything to do with marijuana in his
[SPEAKER_15]: store.
[SPEAKER_15]: He wanted to separate the issues.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark was like, let's call a hip PC and
sell pot seeds out of this store.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's join the issue back together because
it's all one plant, really.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the thing I liked most about Mark
Emory was that when he was attacked,
[SPEAKER_15]: when he was stepped on by the man,
he just came out stronger and more
[SPEAKER_15]: dignified for the weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark, he would be raided by the police.
[SPEAKER_15]: He would open up the next day,
convince all the suppliers to give them
[SPEAKER_15]: back more bongs to wait for another month
to get paid.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he would come right back out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was such a relief to see somebody who
had both money and testicles stand up for
[SPEAKER_15]: our community.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was the first one, really, who did
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because everybody else who had money had
something to lose and they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_15]: lose it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And people didn't want to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_15]: In Edmonton, I had to organize rallies
with a bunch of teenagers who didn't give
[SPEAKER_15]: a shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Had nothing to lose and were prepared to
do some time in jail because they didn't
[SPEAKER_15]: have families to support.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark had a family to support, but he would
risk arrest anyway because he didn't care.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't that important to him.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a stigma of being arrested and
being charged.
[SPEAKER_15]: He'd already got over that stuff in the
early 90s with selling the wrong music,
[SPEAKER_15]: the rap music, nasty as they want to be,
or selling the wrong books, selling high
[SPEAKER_15]: times, or opening up his store on a
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the victimless crimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was not afraid of arrest.
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't care.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's so valuable.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need that in this world.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need people who don't give a shit about
getting arrested because often the wrong
[SPEAKER_15]: laws need to be broken over and over and
over again until they're gone.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you need people who are not afraid in
order to get rid of those laws.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to encourage that sort of behavior
amongst the people who are also articulate
[SPEAKER_15]: and can make money and can do things that
are high functioning.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can give interviews in front of the
press.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another story I think of when I think of
Mark Emery is when the drugs czar for John
[SPEAKER_15]: Walters came from the United States to
give a big talk or discussion here in
[SPEAKER_15]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark bought a table for the pod activists
to sit in and heckle the guy for his
[SPEAKER_15]: entire speech.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see the wisps of steam coming out
of the guy's ears.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was actually blushing because every
time he said we all needed treatment,
[SPEAKER_15]: we all showed him back force treatment.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to give us force treatment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And every time he said that marijuana
users were addicts, he said, hey,
[SPEAKER_15]: give us a choice between jail and therapy.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll pick therapy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you can point to that statistic.
[SPEAKER_15]: He even got the mayors of Vancouver
dissing the drugs czar because we all
[SPEAKER_15]: showed up because he wasn't afraid.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that attack on the drugs czar,
attack on his dignity led to the arrest of
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark Emery for selling seeds in Vancouver,
which led to him doing it four years and
[SPEAKER_15]: two months for seeds, for flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody went to jail during alcohol
prohibition for grape seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: But Mark Emery went to jail for flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: For cannabis seeds during this
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it was for insulting the drugs
czar that he got four years and two months
[SPEAKER_08]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't really having anything to do
with the seeds because lots of people sell
[SPEAKER_15]: seeds, but not everybody rents a table at
the hotel where the drugs czar speaks and
[SPEAKER_15]: then lambasts him with the truth for a
half an hour.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Mark did a nickel.
[SPEAKER_15]: He did five years.
[SPEAKER_15]: On and off for this crime.
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things Mark Emery gets in
trouble for is having called Erwin Kotler
[SPEAKER_15]: a Nazi Jew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you something about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You tell me another victimless crime,
which warrants the death penalty in the
[SPEAKER_15]: United States.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you grow 60 plants or 60,000 plants in
the United States, even industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_15]: you can get the death penalty in the
United States for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_15]: Name me another victimless crime where you
can get the death penalty.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, oh wait, nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody, Mark Emery is in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome home Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you need to get through guys.
Welcome home Mark.
Welcome
home Mark.
How you doing?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my distinct pleasure to welcome back
my brother, my inspiration and our leader,
[SPEAKER_17]: Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, although prison can be a rigorous
experience, fortunately for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was well treated on the inside and uh,
at no point did I ever fear for myself or
[SPEAKER_02]: can I even say that I had anything more
than sometimes extreme discomfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So considering it was a five year sentence
and I did four and a half years and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: back here feeling better than ever,
more motivated than ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get this thing done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sooner than you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now normally I say everything worth while
in life takes longer than you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been doing this for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I've been doing this for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to get marijuana legal and we've
made a lot of progress in Canada and the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States, but next year, October 19th
is legalization day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the day our referendum on marijuana
goes nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we need to do to win, to have
every day after that, a beautiful day
[SPEAKER_02]: under a legalized sun is on October 19th
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just all have to show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most historic election for our
culture because never before has
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization been on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin Trudeau says he wants to legalize
marijuana and millions of Canadians agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to make sure we show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got 14 months to put together
as big a campaign as our culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis culture has ever put
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be home right now because we've got 14
months to turn this country into a nonstop
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion about why we ought to legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: From now to October 19th, every day we
should be dominating the news,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking with our friends, making sure our
grandparents understand that grandma,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the one time I need you to vote
for the Liberal Party and I'll never ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you to do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got a good liberal tide
coming across the country next year as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as federal politics goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sure need that to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we even get to define what
legalization means because if we can talk
[SPEAKER_02]: it up and tell people here's what we
expect from legalization, they will know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they have to deliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's some wonderful stuff going on
all around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is like a Disneyland legality
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow six plants, 12 in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can buy it, you can smoke
it, you can possess it, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacture it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an industry of magazines and media
going on in Colorado and it's just setting
[SPEAKER_02]: this terrific example because all these
visitors to Colorado from around the world
[SPEAKER_02]: from the United States are going there and
go, wow, would I like to turn my hometown
[SPEAKER_02]: on like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the example I always hoped we
set here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say we started that fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not afraid to remind you that the
whole concept of 420, partying all day on
[SPEAKER_02]: April 20th, started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here at Victory Square on April
20th, 1995, the first 420 in the world was
[SPEAKER_02]: held and it was held right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people first came from Vancouver
and a lot of first came from Canada and
[SPEAKER_02]: now that fire is spreading to the rest of
the world and now we can learn from them
[SPEAKER_02]: because Alaska is going to legalize this
November and Oregon is going to legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: this November and even Washington,
D.C., the home of the Congress is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to walk up to the White
House and blow smoke at the President's
meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things are changing and I was happy to
watch them happen even from prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined in a rocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have never touched a musical
instrument in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to this prison where these
outstanding musicians were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if music is criminogenic by
that causal comparison, but there were
[SPEAKER_02]: some outstanding musicians there and they
agreed to teach me all about music and all
[SPEAKER_02]: about playing in a band and all about
playing a bass guitar and I came back with
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of respect for my fellow inmates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, decent people all around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prison is a very polite place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has to be accountable for what
they say and what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't have these people like you do
on the outside in social media call you
[SPEAKER_02]: all these horrible names and big,
terrible things and make stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In prison they would just kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you say, you better hope it's
the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fortunately, I had never an unkind
word said to me by inmates in four and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to six different prisons over that
time in six different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: All different kinds of prisons,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I can tell you, the United
States has a real problem with sentences
[SPEAKER_02]: that go on forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: My five-year sentence was at the very low
end of most inmates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most inmates were doing 20, 30,
40 years for drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One in eight was doing life without parole
simply for drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no kingpin there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought I was the only kingpin in
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were just all ordinary people in
prison and I have a real yearning drive to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure we correct that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And first of all, to never let that get as
bad as it is in the United States here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, to reverse that so that no
one ever goes to jail for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, when is Legalization Day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: October 19th is Legalization Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can believe we're going to have
posters, banners, flags, stamps,
[SPEAKER_02]: stickers saying October 19th is
Legalization Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a half hour of your life,
everybody together, and we'll never have
[SPEAKER_02]: this discussion again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come home to tremendous opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an awesome year ahead
when we make this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to meeting all of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here all day today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you want to stay,
I'll still be here by the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When does the sun set in Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like it's always 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was stolen from here, but when I
left here, I said the one good thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: will come of all this is that Jodie will
come out from behind my shadow and really
[SPEAKER_02]: show people what she can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a lot of pride in how she has
excelled over the last four years and
[SPEAKER_02]: grown and dealt with the challenges of
business, of having EOA, of media,
[SPEAKER_02]: of representing me and our people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have to say that I had no idea
she was so capable, so talented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want to thank you,
Jodie, for being amazing and giving all
[SPEAKER_00]: the sessions I needed to help our country.
[SPEAKER_02]: In prison, I didn't miss anything because
I live in the present tense, so there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: point even going on the path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future will take care of itself if
you're conscious in the present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pretty well focused on where I was at
that time and how to make the best use of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I forgot how beautiful she smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I forgot how wonderful her skin feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I occasionally was reminded in the
visitation rooms how nice it was to kiss
[SPEAKER_02]: her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you, now that I am a free
man, within the limitations we all accept
[SPEAKER_02]: being in a quasi-democratic society,
but being a free man, it's really nice to
[SPEAKER_02]: take part in the sensual pleasures of
smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already up to like 15, 20 joints a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That took all of 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go real slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took three pops the first 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had many interviews to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, that was fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't feel any negative effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had more joints and cash and more stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought, there are no negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am totally back at home.
Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I told, though, and this I find
remarkable, on one hand, it's legal in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, put the legal word in quotes,
and it's legal in Washington, but you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't have allowance like the B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: M.P.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lounge across the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere in Colorado or Washington,
it's legal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have lounges in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've even got like dabbing joints or
whatever they're called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some strange rebel alliance of cannabis
users has formed and broken off from the
[SPEAKER_02]: main sect while I was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 35 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody like genetically multiply Dom
Briere and now he's everywhere opening
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_02]: So 35 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hardly wrap my head around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 15 years ago, we had blocks of
police come by and raid DeKind in 2004
[SPEAKER_02]: when they attempted a vapor land with some
sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much has improved and so much
remains to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, where is legalization going?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to say it again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: David hasn't been out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is anyone here a doctor?
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a medical emergency back there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone got any sort of doctor sort of
thing?
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, if you do need me back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've run for mayor before.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ask me if I'm going to run for
office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that I'll get a lot more
done being the outcast rebel that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been because we've gotten a fair bit done
working with that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an opportunity to be partaking in
the nomination of a wonderful candidate in
[SPEAKER_02]: the next federal election coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is again, my wife, Jody Emmerich,
who will be seeking the Liberal Party
[SPEAKER_02]: nomination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her nomination is Vancouver East.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you live in Vancouver East,
we want to sign you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know people in Vancouver East,
then please ask them to support Jody and
[SPEAKER_02]: her nomination quest to be the candidate
for Vancouver East for the Liberal Party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Liberal Party is the only
party that's advocating legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NDP certainly will not, and the
Conservatives oppose us to the death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to this next election,
I hope you'll consider helping Jody on her
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donating to her campaign, making sure she
gets the nomination.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be an amazing member of
parliament.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she'll be a terrific candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my official election request
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm finished now, but I'm going to be
here for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you very much for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I see you all in the next few
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Redbeard Glass with the freedom,
Marc Emmerich.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should walk right up there and give it
to him, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking rights, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take him up there, Neil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Split the crowd for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: The beard parts the seas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The beard parts the seas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to see this gift.
There it is.
There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he gives it to him packed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right out of the freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does freedom taste?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the base.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your scepter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so cool to watch him make that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long you work on that one,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Full day or so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like neon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great thing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Longtime BC activist.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing to see not 100 people
interviewing him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's known Marc for over 20 years,
and he was a big part of activism here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hacking bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it to see Marc come back?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like he just never even left,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just walked through a door and walked
back out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five years later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowlman here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Longtime activist, Fran Cooper.
[SPEAKER_03]: My good friend, Fran.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, Fran.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good to see you, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just hijacked her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amir is on the camera right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see him, but we were walking
over from the event, which is happening
[SPEAKER_03]: outside still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marc's speech was over, but there's
literally, if you look across the way
[SPEAKER_03]: there, you can see 100 or 200 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see Joe Ruffalo actually standing in
front of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here comes Flav.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in the main thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Flav 421 just walking through the
door.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what we're going to do is
we're going to get the mothership going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it feel to see Marc out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it feels fabulous to see Marc out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just have to get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once Marc's out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I haven't actually seen him in real
life yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shook his hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good to see him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to give him a big hug and
kiss, but after it was done from all these
[SPEAKER_06]: other people where it's off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he's got a lot of people very excited
to see him coming out of the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's hundreds of people, but he only
really knows a handful of them personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see those people coming out of
the crowd, and you can see the recognition
[SPEAKER_03]: on his face when it happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what I should do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: He hasn't seen me yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's definitely looking forward to
seeing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, he's going to be loving it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get that under the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun really did it, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It did, didn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the crystals shining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you sure can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can smell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the barb award-winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should dab it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dave went to get water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did he?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'll just pour my lemonade into
here, and we'll hit lemonade reps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that actually didn't drill.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our options here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I brought him water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must have known you might need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's always nice to have a bottle
of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit much, but we survived.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's have a little rip, shall we,
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting to de-nail all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is girl's first day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think I'm an animal?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four to four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Violin fans, yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, right.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to give some things away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually brought an Apex pen to give
Mark Emory today.
Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's going to need it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to give it to him in a way
like when he's in the middle of all these
[SPEAKER_03]: people, I'll give it to someone and say,
hey, take this home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually, it's the cameraman's shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how the pipe looks like in the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really lights up nice, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: With those pokey things in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flav's got his straight I'm watching a
bong rep face on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, good job, Amir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's thinking, I think he put a little bit
too much water in that straight fab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me that didn't go through your mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're flavin' out Colombian sativa through
the sublimator with our very own
[SPEAKER_03]: sublimator pro, Terry, operating the unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sublimator pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, now here, Dave, how did that taste?
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasted good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasted good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's good tasting herb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I taste it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I tasted it vaporized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's vaporized herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What just came out of the bong was bigger
than most vaporizers' rib.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to hit a sativa like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to hit something that's not super
duper familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, who's up for a dab at the astro
boy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, that sounded like a
beer when it dipped over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way someone's drinking a beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked over and I saw root
beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely using root.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's get you doubled up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you sublimated, and we'll get
you astro boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what that means, but I don't want
you sublimated, but to boo me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santana's music will make it so I can't
upload this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pause it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys from 420 are back in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: You may recognize their glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like to roll with motherships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some LHO, I think I saw over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my whole ratios find work.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of dry sift from myself,
and maybe some bubble hash from Flav.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what are you doing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Blasting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you open blasting right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are just making a batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you don't see that every day,
like on a big thing like Vice,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they were blasting inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised myself at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So retarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a fun day, wasn't it,
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to see Mark Emery for the first
time in five years, making an appearance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got back from Toronto from his
four or five day visit there, from being
[SPEAKER_03]: released from Detroit and up into Windsor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just sort of wanted to finish it
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went over to the Vapor Lounge
afterwards for a little session,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you guys saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was anticipating that more people would
come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark and Jodie were just so exhausted from
their travels.
[SPEAKER_03]: He still hasn't even been home,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went home, and so I decided to
come back myself, but I figured I'd do a
[SPEAKER_03]: little end the video session.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one of the hash plants here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those hash plant buds that
I had that was kind of doing the weird
[SPEAKER_03]: curl claw thing from the MediOne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just went into flower about a month,
a month and a bit ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're a good five plus weeks in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I photographed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a real nice smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been fed pretty much water their
entire life.
[SPEAKER_03]: In front of the hash plant, I've got the
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Docatomics Northern Lights over
here, which has just got such a great
[SPEAKER_03]: smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lemony on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the Lamb's Bread Jamaican,
which I have to say, I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a stalk that I've smelled in all of my
garden that I like more than this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a good sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ortega over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thought I'd have a few plants on
display with me while I sat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I've got the six and a half
year old Master Kush Dabs for hitting
[SPEAKER_03]: through the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we better do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get ourselves a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little dab will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to see Horatio Delbert today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice to see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flav421.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw Franny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw Jason Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Bennett was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana Man, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dana Larson, David Malmolabine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really quite a nice day from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known Mark 20 years and a quarter of
that time he was away in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure we're going to hear a lot from
Mark now that he's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's got plans to go to Ireland and
Spain in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure where I'm going to end up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure I'll be out and about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll try and get an interview with
Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to get him to say a few words for
Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a very busy character.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll make a point on pulling him aside
at one point and getting a few words for
[SPEAKER_03]: the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the torch is loud, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got my garden all surrounding
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can't see it all, but there's
many plants behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the Haas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see some Barber Bud and some Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the Mextiza, the Congolese,
the Lamb's Bread, the Blueberry Skunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: the East Coast Sour Diesel, Hash Plant,
Northern Lights Harmony, more East Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ortega, Stardog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have one Stardog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's over there trucking along,
trying to make its way in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of pink Kush's from the
same guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one of them survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping on keeping that alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, celebrated day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very happy to have Mark Emery back on
Canadian soil and back on B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: A place where you can legally make
concentrates and extract resins from the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know I support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure when.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs that you want with every
season.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got many different kinds of herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Relief depression.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anxiety relief.
[SPEAKER_09]: Treat breathing disorders like asthma.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strengthen the body's immune system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It produces longevity and long life.
