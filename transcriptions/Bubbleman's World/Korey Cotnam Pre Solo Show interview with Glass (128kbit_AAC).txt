[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my good buddy Cory Cotton in
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cory is on his way from the coast into
the city and in the next day or two he's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be making himself making his way out
east for a glass show that you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going out to London.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go to Culture Rising and I'm
gonna have a whole bunch of my glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna have this laid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few pieces ahead of us in
front of us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say a part of, it's his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a solo show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Cory Cotton solo show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is at... Culture Rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture Rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is in London, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's posters all over our social
medias.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out... Check out my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's posters that I've already posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the info on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I was really impressed with the
Hummingbird Feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the recyclers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your style of... I don't even know what
these particular ones are called.
[SPEAKER_01]: K-Cyclers.
[SPEAKER_01]: K-Cyclers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wiggity's, the art in this one and the
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pulled this one out first and it just
absolutely blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pulled this one out,
I think it was about second and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, holy smokes, like the same colors
and lines, but in an actual pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will admit, I was not 100% sure that
this was even a pipe when you first pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: it out because I was looking inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, they're all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is like a Hummingbird Feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't... Then I saw the down stamp and
obviously, guys, I'm gonna take some
[SPEAKER_01]: photos of this so you guys will be able to
look at things in beautiful detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are only four pieces that are...
They'll also come to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them in full detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are only four pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more than four pieces in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a whole slew I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've already sent them a whole
arsenal of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting t-shirts made,
stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were they?
[SPEAKER_01]: The goddesses of the can?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's the two posters that they
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those two style shirts and then
he's also doing some graphics for some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be a few shirts available at
the show.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of the culmination of,
wouldn't you say...
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, your entire career,
but the recyclers and how you've really
[SPEAKER_01]: been trying to innovate that recycler and
create something that's really more corey
[SPEAKER_01]: than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has that been now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that been a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been two years?
[SPEAKER_01]: That I've been making the recyclers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that you've been on this sort of
innovative... Because I've seen things
[SPEAKER_01]: started out as cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's probably been close to a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little less, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight months now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done all of those designs in a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting the cubes and it's just
trying to find the best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that function the best and they
slowly progress into these ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find you can hit these ones the hardest,
get any splash back.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the other ones, you have to start
them a little slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still function 100%, but you got to
just kind of kickstart it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that's a major point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have that kickstart, then you can
haul as hard as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these ones, you can hit right off the
bat hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the kickstart one that you had,
the one where you pull it just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: gentle, get it in there and then start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, that's kind of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find with the Eternal Drain,
it's too close to the perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hit too hard, it'll want to suck
the water up the center before it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's one of the things I love
about both you and Stratis is obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: all glassblowers are on the hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to blow glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to be on their torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not working other jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're blowing glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have a deep respect for,
and I always take it back to Jason Lee,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was always very obsessed how they felt
when he put water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put water in them and pulled through
them, that rumble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hand feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the visuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love these ones because they're just the
most comfiest grip in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like your little guy said,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a handle, Dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost use these like a cup and
drink out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, one of the things that I
appreciate about both you and Stratis is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't find something to do and then
just do it over and over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's innovation and change that occurs
in each aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, as a fan of glass and
smoking and seeing new things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really, really have an
appreciation for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I watched Stratis with a simple
little spinning marble turn into this
[SPEAKER_01]: explosive idea that's like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the series that he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's very cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that you guys are both just
right across the water from me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised even earlier saying,
oh, I'm surprised high integrity glass art
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't stop by more often because he's so
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised I don't stop by more often
because I'm so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get up there like twice a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it's summertime, I'm pretty busy
and I'm in a shop all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good time to come and visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is exciting, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long does this show go for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from 7 to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be there for the whole...
I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, come by, say hi, let's do some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ontario always represents really
well for me when I go out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure you're not going to see a much
difference in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to London for college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Fanshawe for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be interesting to see if
anybody that I knew actually shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure my buddy Pete is from
London.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a shop called Shakedown Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Pete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Pete for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he used to be good close friends with
friends of mine over here, the Breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an organic traveler, is he not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, the NYPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: NYPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a weird name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me a little bit about the
inspiration for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's obviously substantially
different from the other three pieces on
[SPEAKER_01]: the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my inspiration for the DFO piece
that I was going to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a hard time just kind of,
what am I going to make that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the nicest that I can actually make in the
short one day, 12 hours that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hummingbird was one that I could
come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was relatively easy enough to make in
that time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, relatively easy is definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't as worked as this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have any of the reticello or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the petals were just flared open,
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were some shortcuts that I took.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took for the original piece that I was
going to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I haven't seen anybody make the
hummingbird feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like an on-tact avenue to go
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fully Bravo, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these glassblowers, and I know
that it pains them because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be learning these techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glassblowing was always passed on from
master to student.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a student just decided he
was going to be a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things were passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we have this community that is
very scared of being jacked, of being
[SPEAKER_01]: bitten, of being taken for their
techniques and their unique things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see you in particular always like
you do these excellent line work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that you have learned from the
glassblowers that you have learned from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you represent them beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see how in the glassblowing
world, that's a point of contention with
[SPEAKER_01]: some artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no problem charging for a class
and teaching these techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they also kind of have no problem
being a little bit pissed off when some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the students... Some people are using the
same techniques and they just went out and
[SPEAKER_01]: taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's a tough thing to see
sometimes the student surpass the master
[SPEAKER_01]: or the student do so well that it kind of
throws the teacher off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give you guys props.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely like this hummingbird
feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good style.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean the little birds, turning them
into dabbers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of it is really on point as
you guys will be able to see from the
[SPEAKER_01]: photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, I'll take the pieces outside and
I'll go with the 4K camera and give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice kind of close-up because... My
goodness, Corey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me want to go to Ontario and be
there at the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last-minute trip, around the last-minute
trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, December 3rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Saturday?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss having my gallery and doing things
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have been a great thing to have
all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another time, you know, Vancouver
could really use something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borough and Beyond has been talking about
doing a group show with us all so that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: possibility down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean you guys have the
talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of silly not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass events are so fun, too, if you guys
have ever been to... I haven't been to a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw a couple of great ones with
Marbleslinger, the Degenerate Art and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerate Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epic, historical shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was the Melty Pot Show in San
Francisco prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been shows at Goosefire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been shows at a variety of
galleries around North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the Dapcrane Gallery in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to some wonderful shows there as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a nice thing for our community
to have access to, to get us out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always looking to get cannabis more
normalized, cannabis use more normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, super high-end functional art
plays a very important role in bringing a
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people who would maybe otherwise
not be as into this culture as we are with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can guarantee you that this could be
sold to a collector without them having
[SPEAKER_01]: any knowledge that it's a pipe whatsoever
and still being super stoked on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally hanging it for enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes me want to smoke, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to dirty up your beautiful
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all going to be available at
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get to try a few of these at
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's always nice when the
collector comes in and purges and then
[SPEAKER_01]: offers...
[SPEAKER_01]: I always did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was always hard with someone like
Marcel who was always like, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take the first hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd be like, no, you take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Slinger took it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, damn straight, you will,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn straight, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm excited for you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to have a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be good to be back in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the old stomping ground,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carved up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very, very stoked to see this
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that it was a sunnier day and I
could get the most epic photos of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cloudy, but we've got some
pretty good white, bright light out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I photograph it from the right angle,
I should be able... My main factor in
[SPEAKER_01]: photographing glass like this is doing it
justice, doing the artist justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing the actual peace justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, man, I'll tell you, sometimes one
of the pictures aren't very... I saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice article recently where I think it was
about a glass blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was about some guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blow $100,000 glass pipes or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even recognize his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pictures literally looked like
they were taken in 1980 by someone who was
[SPEAKER_01]: drunk at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all out of focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blurry, super out of focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of jacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's got to be on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can't be a fingerprint on there
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every comment in the comment section was
like, what did you hire the worst
[SPEAKER_01]: photographer on the planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, that rosin you just hit is six
months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that green crack God rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dipped into... Dipped into some
Swiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the high CBD cultivars have these
fruity, cherry-esque flavors, which you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: often hear people say CBD has a cherry
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually high CBD cultivars have a
cherry flavored terpene profile would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: more accurate way of saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if I will see you in
Ontario, but I do look forward to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you will do a little bit of a
live stream while you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little Facebook live stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely try to do some.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do a five to 10 minute live
stream, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share it on my social media and we'll
make sure a big audience gets on there to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch it because it'd be kind of a cool
way for those of you that aren't able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it to be able to get a little taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to be able to have someone walk
through quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll be able to figure that out
between the two of us for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely...
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever noticed rips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop ripping when you dip the
midterms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably go like six, seven times
before they actually stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even some other oils and stuff that I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit and hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit and hit and hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some live residents, I find it like that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just hit and hit and hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to call it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to call it a day here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some things to get done in the
city and I've also got some things to get
[SPEAKER_01]: done, but you guys know the show is in
London, Ontario, Saturday, December the
[SPEAKER_01]: 3rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uprising?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like culture rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make sure we get the name of the
place right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Ontario's representing the glass
scene really strong, maybe substantially
[SPEAKER_01]: better than we are here out in the West
Coast, not in regards to blowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just in the community that seems to
want to have these shows and to support
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you luck, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, Gus.
