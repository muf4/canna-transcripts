gonna say that they don't but at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time I have some other techniques

a very close to three-year-old son who
[SPEAKER_00]: turns three next month on the 27th of
August so enjoy that bro how sweet is that
[SPEAKER_00]: what is sweeter than a little
three-year-old boy or girl for that matter
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just so absolutely innocent and
sweet that age the things that come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth just drop your jaw to the floor
half the time they're so beyond cute oh
[SPEAKER_00]: the volume seems low well let's turn it up
how about that how about that are we good
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch I love that you guys give me the
little bits of you know you help me with
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the feed and I do
appreciate that the microphone may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been turned down I can turn it up even a
little bit more ah yes well I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 year old the 14 year old ends the
three-year-old I'm not too sure if team
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan puffs and here's what I would say
about that Japan is a very harsh place
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis smoking smoking
in public would not be the smartest idea
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on videos would not be the
smartest idea and I would not share even
[SPEAKER_00]: if they did because they still live in a
very prohibition based place and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's best for us to just respect they did
not puff the entire time I was there so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not lying when I say I did not see
them puff and I respect their privacy if
[SPEAKER_00]: they do want to puff that's fine John
that's great that you know that but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of you know allow it maybe not
be the best conversation for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular sorry about that guys that was
my mentor Ron Hickey middle of and then
[SPEAKER_00]: phone showed that he was funny knowing
when he'll probably call back three more
[SPEAKER_00]: times so definitely expect at least one or
two more interruptions and in the meantime
[SPEAKER_00]: that sweets going tasted so damn good I
think it's I think we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: another one I think we're gonna have
another one there is a very big cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture growing in Japan it is absolutely
the truth there's no doubt about it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that's why John Green has decided to
live there and sell Japanese glass you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they're blowing a lot of glass
makes sense that there is a marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: for that glass I won the pin giveaway over
yes hey man I love the wake and bakes
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't missed any you're my mentor and
you never call bubble man sorry Drew I the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about a mentor is it's it's easy to
sort of pick who you want to mentor you
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not until the mentor picks that
he's going to mentor you that really the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship begins at least for me I mean
I'm not talking about that you can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by different people online but
for me like my mentors have been friends
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life they have been people who have
been present in my life throughout my days
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see them many times and it was
really their decision that allowed for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of study under them it's I have
lots of people call me a mentor all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time that say that I'm their mentor and
it's it's an honor to to know that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiring some people but it really is
this relationship that it's when the
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor decides to see something in you
that reminds him of something he once had
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that is you know similar to
his core foundation and his belief systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you get picked and that's how
it just yeah that's just how it happens
[SPEAKER_00]: it's trippy but it is what it is Japan
grow cannabis would be cool hey thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: Elliot well they do they do but it's
definitely symbiotic in the sense you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like you definitely it's it's usually the
student who wants the mentor but when the
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor chooses the student that's when
you're like yes like I can't believe you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for for me I felt honored when Ron
decided that I was kind of a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: character to him and that he would bring
me under his wing and he would show me
[SPEAKER_00]: things and put trust in me that was very
very like let's just say out there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: time being it was a huge responsibility
and level of trust pharmacy bros what Ron
[SPEAKER_00]: put into me when I was very young just
just out of my teenage years really and so
[SPEAKER_00]: not quite the same but similar with skunk
man Sam who you know put a huge trust and
[SPEAKER_00]: faith in me by showing me his technique
you know something that I could have
[SPEAKER_00]: easily blown up and shown the entire world
and just been a liar and and my word not
[SPEAKER_00]: been worth shit but he he put his his
faith and his trust in me and generally
[SPEAKER_00]: when one of my elders puts their faith and
their trust in me I will go to great
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths great lengths to maintain that
integrity well you know I met Ron by going
[SPEAKER_00]: into his hydroponic store I met skunk man
Sam by having a booth at the Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing bubble bag water hash and
popularizing full-mount resins which he he
[SPEAKER_00]: had been living for 20 years already and
yeah that's sort of yeah there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of Ron Hickey videos up the Grinch
I went to his house in the Kootenays and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one called feeding your
endocannabinoid system where we do lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: or breakfast together we make bubble
together out on his deck I think we do a
[SPEAKER_00]: tour of his grow but I'm trying to get him
out here I'm trying to get him to move out
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Kootenays get him back here out
on the west coast and try to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse project so Sam is a man of many
many things I could not just call Sam a
[SPEAKER_00]: sift man of course as a smoker he loves
smoking sift but he's much more than that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a master breeder he is he is like
cannabis and carnate he is just like he is
[SPEAKER_00]: he is cannabis sorry I got a little bit of
the hiccups here maybe we should have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rip maybe that'll get rid of my
hiccups what do you guys think the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take my bong rip right away there
was because a friend of mine told me when
[SPEAKER_00]: you first fill the torch that it's best to
not turn it on right away I guess there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a seal inside the torch that gets cold
when you put the the gas in because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: quite cold and that seal can blow and the
torch will start leaking gas even when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not on and it won't hold gas anymore
and I was like what a great tip for torch
[SPEAKER_00]: culture I was thinking that I messed mine
up and I wasn't turning it off enough but
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I had just pooched the previous
one by putting in fuel and then lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: it up literally like a minute later so
might be something you want to you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: piss me off somehow Peter M who's the
first person to call you bubble man well
[SPEAKER_00]: that was me chase I came up with the
bubble bag and I came up with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh headies and I came up with the name
bubble man where do you see the beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: urban 50 to 100 years oh wow I don't even
know man who's to say that's that I'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: to really figure that out think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you Andy I'm coming to the Karma Cup
as you all know I got this really cool are
[SPEAKER_00]: you elite pin I guess you can get a shout
out to your father David pro sir we only
[SPEAKER_00]: have so many days left kindest gentleman
loving man I know wow he's only got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days left well I'm sorry to hear that do Z
we will give a shout out to David and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know you but I know that you have
people that love you I know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: touched people in a very unique way and
that you probably made the world a better
[SPEAKER_00]: place while you were here if you have
people in my chat room asking for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a shout out so we are gonna give
you a shout out and the shout out is that
[SPEAKER_00]: yes you are elite and so if you would like
to do gog send me your address to BC
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man at iCloud I want to send you
this little pin and it's the are you elite
[SPEAKER_00]: pin and a shout out to your father David
poster there you go brother
[SPEAKER_00]: yummy alrighty here that was a nice nice
little moment to share with the og and
[SPEAKER_00]: David and all his loved ones bless up
bless up bless up no gotta make that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen we've got to celebrate not just the
birthdays Tommy but we've got to celebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the deaths as well they're sad and it
sounds weird but do you want to celebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: your loved ones or do you want to mourn
them and that's you know mourning is
[SPEAKER_00]: natural I don't think it's a choice that
we we choose it just happens and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: does it differently but if we could choose
what we want to do is we want to celebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: our loved ones our friends and our family
those that's that's what we want to do we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to celebrate them so that's what we
shall do yeah man I lost my father
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly very different from it sounds
like the way you're going through it my
[SPEAKER_00]: father was taken from me very suddenly in
a motorcycle accident along with his wife
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was shocking and it affected me in
a way that I had no idea could affect me
[SPEAKER_00]: so I have you know empathy for people who
are going through losing their parents or
[SPEAKER_00]: any loved one for that matter well that's
still pretty fresh Andy for me it was 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years plus and I was still feeling it very
very very very strongly yeah well water
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a crazy thing right it can create
some serious anxiety it can create some
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity we in our culture have not
really prepared ourselves properly I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you see how we go to school they don't
prepare us for anything they don't teach
[SPEAKER_00]: us about banks and loans and paying taxes
and businesses and equity and purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: and like all of the important things that
you would think that you should be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for in life they don't teach you
about so why would they teach you about
[SPEAKER_00]: death why would they have any inkling to
want to share knowledge why would we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to celebrate it right we just mourn it in
our culture and because we mourn it its
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not celebrated it's not discussed too
much and even when people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: through it it's uncomfortable for other
people you know it's almost like they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to hear it even though they're
there it's like I'm there for you but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't want to hear about death it's
like I don't want to die it's like well
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what we all get to go there together
it seems like a pretty crazy thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all like one of the one things we're
all gonna share in common is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all going to die that's a pretty heavy
conversation that I can't believe more
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't having but I guess it is
what it is people are freaked out it's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah take some psychedelics and you'll see
it's not quite as scary there are
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels to this shit and this is
just one of the current levels that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing now I don't just call it just
one because personally I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the most valuable and one
of the most precious experiences to have
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grand scheme of things when you
think of the concept of all life you know
[SPEAKER_00]: soul energy coming from a single source a
whole a one and then fractioning off into
[SPEAKER_00]: what we know as this experience and then
going back into that hole well it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like if we came from there and we're going
from there this right here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience take the third hit all right
I'll take the third hit let's do it yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we all came from the same place too which
is pretty trippy I'm down I'm down all
[SPEAKER_00]: right who's ready for a third rip three is
a charm three is a cosmic number and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't checked out cosmic trigger by
Robert Anton Wilson well that was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first books that got me into all sorts
of crazy shit volume one two and three
[SPEAKER_00]: oh it's no burden let me tell you hey
Harry Dolan welcome welcome you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: missed my as much we've just been hanging
out talking about you know shit like death
[SPEAKER_00]: losing our loved ones fairly intense
conversations for a wake and bake but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it's all it all needs to be
covered and I think that you know much
[SPEAKER_00]: like our perspectives they're all they all
come from this one source whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective you want to look at it through
it's all sort of the same thing and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of sometimes hard to understand but
eat about six grams of mushrooms in a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: room like Terrence said and you will
understand quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome Rob Rosen glad you made it too
glad you made it too it's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite songs standing on the moon such a
beautiful song if you can catch the right
[SPEAKER_00]: live version of it Jerry just bearing his
soul if you don't know Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: standing on the moon Google it YouTube it
go listen to it listen him to sing listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to him sing those lyrics
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms in the dark room yeah Terrence
McKenna would say years ago that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to crush your ego because for
Terrence he what he saw in the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience was that a lot of people were
holding on to their egos they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite dissolving their egos fully they
were doing these one and two kind of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know lighter trips and he kind of came
along and just said look if you just eat
[SPEAKER_00]: like five and a half grams five to six
grams dried and then go into a dark room
[SPEAKER_00]: not a pitch black room but a dark room
that has shadow there it's it's I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even explain it it is more like a DMT
experience than a mushroom experience it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely something very very very very
intense and we did it in a room that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the smallest amount of light and the light
was shining on a mandala that was hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: on the full size of the wall and we laid
there with our heads to it and it was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most experience unbelievable
experiences of my life it was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the experiences where I learned
that the soul the experience the you
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever that experience is minus the ego
because I'm pretty sure the ego stays
[SPEAKER_00]: behind with the body can leave it just can
leave and it's like it's not until you let
[SPEAKER_00]: go of the ego that you can actually it's
almost like the ego is what traps the soul
[SPEAKER_00]: in the body and through psychedelics if
you can crush the ego enough blow it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room for four or five hours you can
really release the soul and you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: these sort of cosmic experiences that are
above and beyond most everyday experience
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah and you're looking down at
yourself exactly Sal when you can leave
[SPEAKER_00]: your body but but without your ego pretty
crazy I don't know about that I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't hear that Sven that's crazy insane
experience I hope that that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth and let's just hope that that's not
the truth yeah yeah I bet there is
[SPEAKER_00]: something going on there well it makes
sense right because the ego is what
[SPEAKER_00]: convinces you that your you that you is it
when really it is not and it's not until
[SPEAKER_00]: you blow the ego out that you really
experience that and it's a very sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know it's an extremely
psychedelic experience it's very touching
[SPEAKER_00]: soul-searching experience that can bring
you to tears that can just make you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: the most intense awe and beauty and
inspiration that you could ever imagine I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that society should have things set
up for safe consumption of these
[SPEAKER_00]: substances for places where people can go
much like the way you can take your dog to
[SPEAKER_00]: a park or your kid to a park there should
be areas in nature around cities that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go to to experience psychedelic
experiences you know amongst comforting
[SPEAKER_00]: environments with with people who are
aware and with just like the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: experience right you wouldn't want to have
like a big what do they call that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton candy machine or something at the
psychedelic park that would be no thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not having any soft serve ice cream
or cotton candy but if you want to cut us
[SPEAKER_00]: up some fresh slices of fruit and some ice
waters maybe some bowls of hashish that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be on point for certain yeah that's
what I'm saying yep great idea right I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's important why are we forced to
go do this in a place first of all like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not supposed to be doing what we're
doing that creates right off the bat you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's intention that's not your
intention that becomes a part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and this is of course where the
smaller doses and the ego holding on and
[SPEAKER_00]: fear falling into place that can really
throw people off and they'll say oh I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad experience on that substance it's
like are you sure you didn't have a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: experience on that substance because you
know people say that substance is illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not supposed to do it so you
have this underlining feeling of like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing something wrong or I don't want
to interact with the authority or law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement right now any of those
energies and thoughts while tripping can
[SPEAKER_00]: direct you in ways of places that you
would not want to go in my opinion oh I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting excited I'm getting calls for for
this video I'm gonna be filming another
[SPEAKER_00]: video in a couple hours here and that's
going to be the Japan the team Japan with
[SPEAKER_00]: dosa cup I believe doses in the cup as
well like he was there I know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: made some pendants him in Yoshinori but
I'm pretty sure he'll be in the cup as
[SPEAKER_00]: well so we'll check it out I'll go we'll
go see what's going on I'll bring the fork
[SPEAKER_00]: okay camera take it out onto the the deck
and film it in the Sun super super stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: to see this it's too bad almost that I
posted the video but whatever this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: the second part it's gonna be very short
I'm not sure if the artists themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: will be there if they are I'll try to get
a small interview with each one the best I
[SPEAKER_00]: can and oh is there a troll tell me what
the trolls name is and I'll I'll hammer
[SPEAKER_00]: the troll I will hammer the troll oh here
we go I see the troll and you're damn
[SPEAKER_00]: straight I'm wearing a Bob Marley t-shirt
straight up you know Bob Marley most
[SPEAKER_00]: inspirational reggae artist to ever live
light the fires cannabis activists
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinaire you know cannabis activists
extraordinaire you're damn straight in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact not only did I get this shirt at
Bob's house but what did Damien are sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: what did Rowan say to us after hitting his
dab and walking away what did he say he
[SPEAKER_00]: said I want to see it come on we know
someone's gonna post it in the chat room
[SPEAKER_00]: we gotta say we gotta see it respect to
the dabas respect to the dabas yeah dude
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta go bro you gotta go it's kind of
intense to have that kind of like intense
[SPEAKER_00]: just like horrible horrible hatred and
it's just quite the opposite of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all about isn't it trying to create
division you know by whatever it can be to
[SPEAKER_00]: divide men and women it can be to divide
straight and gays it can be divide white
[SPEAKER_00]: and and colored it can be anything that
they can get their hands on to create
[SPEAKER_00]: division and of course we all know it's to
divide and conquer so this is like these
[SPEAKER_00]: are like some social sociopathic maniacs
that came up with these concepts so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: find yourself thinking in these ways you
know I would say start consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in a big way you definitely hey take it
easy Indra thanks for coming in brother
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great day we'll see you when we see
you probably on tomorrow's wake and bake I
[SPEAKER_00]: would suspect hopefully yes we are less
powerful divided that is a very true story
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a crazy like cartoon called ants
that they did in like the late 90s maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 98 or something and it's one of these kids
cartoons but you know the wasps all have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ants working for them and making their
food and it's like there's not that many
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps and they're they kind of talk about
man if these ants ever figured out how
[SPEAKER_00]: easily they could control us it's really
heavy duty if you haven't seen that movie
[SPEAKER_00]: you should check it out because there is a
whole lot of shit going on in there and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bug's life right they are definitely
dealing with some heavy stories
[SPEAKER_00]: underlining of a simple cartoon that I'm
almost blown away that that it was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get produced and made into a movie I do
need like a troll bell exactly all someone
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to do is hit the troll bell and
I'd be like oh looks like the hammer needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be dropped then again I could just make
a bunch of you guys moderators in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and you guys could be hammering people but
the funny thing is when you do that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes people get out of hand it's like
yeah and then the next thing you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting email saying hey that guy banned
me by accident it's also hard sometimes to
[SPEAKER_00]: ban people because as you guys are
chatting I'm trying to catch his name and
[SPEAKER_00]: push the thing next to his name if I go to
push it and it moves up one well then I've
[SPEAKER_00]: just accidentally banned someone who
didn't deserve to be banned and we still
[SPEAKER_00]: have to listen to the hateful spewings of
a fucking seriously insecure possibly just
[SPEAKER_00]: upset dude or woman I don't know I think
people are upset I think people are
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out and I think people are you
know whacked out on bad diets and alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: and tobacco and caffeine and pharma these
are all things that are gonna be hectic on
[SPEAKER_00]: your nervous system I can't even imagine
all of them holy shit I mean recently I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw that the actor who played Lafayette on
True Blood just died at 39 I was like how
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck did he die and then they're like
oh he stopped drinking alcohol he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy alcoholic he was he stopped drinking
alcohol and his body went into full
[SPEAKER_00]: failure his heart just couldn't keep up
how hardcore of a drug is alcohol that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can stop your heart if you drink too much
of it and then stop drinking it that to me
[SPEAKER_00]: is demonic that is like a demonic
possession that got so deep into him that
[SPEAKER_00]: he could not get it out it's like where
they tell you oh no we can't get the demon
[SPEAKER_00]: out they'll die it's like whoa alcohol is
not a drug it is a spirit they call that
[SPEAKER_00]: sit that shit spirits for many many years
and it freaks me out I definitely am NOT
[SPEAKER_00]: like inspired to try and prohibit anything
but it would be nice if humanity came to
[SPEAKER_00]: the conclusion that alcohol is a fucking
con and much like what John Mayer just
[SPEAKER_00]: said recently in a Rolling Stone interview
saying alcohol is a fucking con I never
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like I could get enough it's the
ultimate chasing of the dragon and more
[SPEAKER_00]: worse than that you know the chasing of
the dragon just leads you into deep opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and usually it's not a pretty
sight alcohol addiction seems to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: socially acceptable and you can just
operate it throughout your whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are just hardcore alcoholics
waking up and strapping on a gun and going
[SPEAKER_00]: and being a cop or whatever it's pretty
fucked up everything in moderation I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: down with a little moderation myself I
personally don't enjoy alcohol because I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew up what I consider Winnipeg was like
an incubator of alcoholics it was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people drinking alcohol on an abusive
level and it freaked me out to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy freaked me out completely I
didn't like it I just sort of tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay away from it I don't really like bars
you know I don't like concerts where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're serving alcohol because there's
just gonna be people who are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: unpredictable that will be there you know
abusing alcohol to the most insane level
[SPEAKER_00]: yes a lot do leather a lot do I mean if
you're drinking a lot of booze you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably smoking a lot of cigs you know
yeah it's true well let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something a little more happy Brett
Armstrong like feeding our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: systems the polar opposites of all the
drugs that they want you on alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco caffeine sugar and a shitty shitty
shitty shitty shitty diet if they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: you on all those things and not using
cannabis they've definitely won the game
[SPEAKER_00]: that is their most profitable agenda so
what are we going to do we're going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and cut down on our sugar and our caffeine
intake we're going to try and stop smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: radioactive cigarettes completely and
maybe alcohol completely just for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it out of the brain to get it out
of the system so you can feel what you
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like being it's good to know what
you feel like being and you know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are drinking for reasons that you're
trying to numb and uncover potentially not
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking and using cannabis instead will
stimulate thoughts about those different
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and instead of burying them you can
dig them up and maybe plant a seed of
[SPEAKER_00]: positivity in there and then start feeding
that every day because you know the old
[SPEAKER_00]: story the native story of the grandfather
telling his grandson that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: battle going on in each of us with two
wolves and you know there's the good side
[SPEAKER_00]: the white wolf and the black wolf as he
says and the little grandson is like which
[SPEAKER_00]: which wolf is gonna win and he says well
that depends on which one you feed are you
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna feed your light are you gonna feed
your darkness maybe moderation maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of both but I prefer to feed as
much light as possible yeah do you enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: eating root vegetables like cassava yeah I
like some root vegetables absolutely I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean when I'm in Jamaica I'm actually
getting a lot more access to that than I
[SPEAKER_00]: am of course Irish I have the Irish blood
in me so I do love me a good potato I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna lie I'm actually like a potato
fiend I could eat potatoes with every meal
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred different ways I fucking love
potatoes maybe that's something you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about me guys but I'm sharing it
right now guilty food pleasure oh I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe pizza I love pizza I've had it
all different ways from raw pizza to vegan
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza to you know full meat pizza I was
not always a vegetarian oh this banger is
[SPEAKER_00]: rather large it's not just you
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated pizza you've been watching
Samuel you've been watching there you go
[SPEAKER_00]: devil's harvest although I will tell
people who are trying to feed their
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid systems that smoking
joints although will be a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate appetites and induce sleep and
reduce ocular pressure and do a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of other things oral consumption
of it on the daily is something I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely say is a good idea as a
preventative whether you eat a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: when you wake up or eat a little bit when
you go to bed or both and some in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the day I don't know but you
should definitely be doing it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a it's a good thing to do feeding your
endocannabinoid system through oral
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption not just the smoking of
cannabis so try to do that on the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway I think that we are good to go
