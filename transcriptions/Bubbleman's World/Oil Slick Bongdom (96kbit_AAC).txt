[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um, it's my secret weakness is good
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it every day in life, really,
it's the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we meet, when I hang out
with my brother or my dad or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to impress each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys blow up the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even my dad's, like, what we call black
ash, because he decarbs it, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: old school till it turns black.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes his keef and just boils it till
it's fucking black.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smooth as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull a dunk out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dump that right out on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sitting here with Josh from Oil
Slick, company that needs no introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have blown up in the last couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice of you to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not even, you know,
blowing smoke up your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally, like, I can't believe how
many people kind of got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hope when you come up with a
new product, it's like, oh, just a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk of the head shops pick this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oil Slick is definitely a great
product and today you've come by and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to share a new product with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm pretty stoked on this one,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just showed me off camera and I
thought, man, we got to show that on
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so simple and so, for me,
a guy that goes to a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Amsterdam at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down in Spain at the Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Stepping High Ganja Festival
in Negril.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking with people all around the
world and, you know, this year there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: company that had a product and it was kind
of similar to, it was a piece that fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bong and then made, you know,
its own mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a plastic piece, similar to what
you guys make your oil slick, a silicone
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a plug, exactly, but I just,
I couldn't get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't, I just didn't think,
like, having this giant, it was like this
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this seems to me a much better
concept and I'll just let you do... Sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got your own, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Slick Shield is, it's a bong condom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call it around the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bongdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bongdom, bong condom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we try to stay classy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Slick Shield is something that
we've had around the office for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't know if it was something
people would like to see in mass
[SPEAKER_01]: production, but we're all about elegant
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like solutions that kind of slipstream
fit in with what people are normally
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, naturally doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why a large pendant affair or
something like that doesn't really make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, to be frank,
so we love our glass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like this mothership piece right here,
the idea of plugging that hole and
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the dynamic of the glass was
something we couldn't even kind of get our
[SPEAKER_01]: heads around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should only take me a second to show
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in these packages like this,
just a basic little paper envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little rope tie thing on the
back with directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: The directions are pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stretch it, you press it, and then you
release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes inside of a little hygienic
plastic pouch like this and you open it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sticky platinum cured silicone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medical grade silicone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very sticky, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare that to like the containers that
we make where the pad is very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why it's stretchy,
you stretch it, you press it, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if your camera can pick
up that it's just basically like a film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really impede the function or
the draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you're done hitting it,
you just peel it off, put it back in your
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic inner shield and slip it back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the idea behind this is that unlike
alcohol wipes, which they're smelly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're really like the best solution
that we have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For this sort of deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to stretch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty neat, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the clear one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the one I prefer,
but we do have like pink and blue and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for the women, for the ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about the alcohol wipes that was
kind of a deal is that you kind of depend
[SPEAKER_01]: on the person with the rig to have those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets old.
[SPEAKER_01]: People stop doing it eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it when I want to and kind of puts
it in my own control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow I missed my opportunity to get it
to have that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took your piece off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did.
I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took my sling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, look.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have one now, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: How nice is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's festival season right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cup cough is something that like
we all dread.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, almost everybody I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even share pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know so many web celebs and people who
are like vlogging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at these things all the time,
and they'll just carry their own little
[SPEAKER_01]: pendium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you've got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you see, I've got the technique
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I've done it more than once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how hard I could stretch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since people are going to watch this
video, and when they Google Slick Shield,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might find this video, stretch the
shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The real hint is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put that on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hole is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, you want to get it
much bigger so you can get that rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say from just ripping it,
one of the things that was interesting is
[SPEAKER_00]: it is still the shape and the feel of the
pipe that you're hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't altered that mouthpiece feel
aside from just putting a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: coating over top of it, which I'll tell
you, you guys have seen me on my videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share bowls with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a bad idea to just have them a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful rig to get to try this
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mothership, all of them really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Mothership from my
hometown, Bellingham, Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard not to shout out the Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Taurus, the Straight Fab,
and the Fab Egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm going to say the Fab Egg
is probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tabletop, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Slick Shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can they get these They can order
them on our website, oilslickpad.com.
