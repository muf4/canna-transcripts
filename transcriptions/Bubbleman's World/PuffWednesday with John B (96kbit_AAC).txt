[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm container John in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this lovely lady, would you like to
introduce her, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's actually your introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Astro Boy from TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was originally bred accidentally,
actually, by bad boy who had, he was
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the three strains that he
had in the male pollen, but he basically
[SPEAKER_01]: came up with this bad boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Astro Boy, this is the watermelon
pheno.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually, if you watch the video of
me and Nelson, or in Proctor, when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: with my good friend Ron Hickey,
we were making bubble together outside in
[SPEAKER_01]: the snow, and we ended up making the
watermelon bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a cut or two, and I brought
them back and spread them out amongst
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, John and myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John managed to grow them up really
nice and big and healthy, and pass some
[SPEAKER_01]: out, and then I got mine nice and big and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of mine right here,
actually, that were, fuck, I love these
[SPEAKER_01]: little plants, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible structure on that plant,
too, like the arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arms are so strong on these guys right
here, these particular side branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just one of my little babies
that I got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have too many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm allowed to have a 98 in my license,
but I'm one of those few people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually using the license just for
medicine and not using it to pay my
[SPEAKER_01]: mortgage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only have like seven plants going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to John for bringing them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have the watermelon bubble,
a bunch of the watermelon bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the watermelon, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is from my Kootenay trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we can get you focused in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we'll start you off with that,
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pull yourself out a little
hit, and I will get the pipe over to you
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great thing about the D-nail is these,
nice long whips that they give you with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always moving the hash out of the way
of the whip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whip's nice though, in the sense that
it's not so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to puff the watermelon beside
the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffing the watermelon beside the
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some 73 for John.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's some, actually this one we say
second run on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 micron second run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the quality on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that not too much of the powder
is falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was like a two and a half
month cure on this particular stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean this hash particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two to three weeks of just drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get it into a situation where it could
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, go ahead and scoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when you look at it, it's
crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you push it together,
it's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you wouldn't think it's bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be like, wow, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to give a shout out to Subcool
and Jill, the TGA crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always been sort of family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always really backed us and
promoted bubble bags and the way of water
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've always been just good people
sharing and educating and passing on great
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant like this, I feel, is a special
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very special plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we've got our injunction
happening here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping on the 18th of March that
we're going to go to court and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to find out that our licenses will be
extended.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what has to happen for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, John and I are off to
Spain for spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you out there are going to be
in Spain, you can come check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What booth will you be at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the Planet Seward booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planet Seward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll either be at Medicali Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's booth number 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Canabia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canabia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll be at Canabia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'll be at the Hoodlum booth as well as
another potential booth that I'll be at as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see us walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're around, come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some beautiful hash,
please definitely approach me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be filming a little
documentary with Tony from River Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come puff with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come puff with John as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are filming a documentary and we
want to see the best hash that we can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do see me and you feel that you
have something you want to show off,
[SPEAKER_01]: make a point on stopping and showing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hit some more of this water,
John?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be something we could
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this five minute run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Five minute run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that second run I just did was
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty delicious, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: A five minute run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain the five minute run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the amount of mixing that happened
for this particular batch was five
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just the first mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the first mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't mix for a super long amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass it over that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a nice whiff of the plant while
you're... That was probably the nicest dab
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab over a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you dabbed over a plant lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Darn fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darn fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail rips with the watermelon plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you loaded that one up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to be generous with my good
friend John, who's helped me so much with
[SPEAKER_01]: my grow tent and all my equipment and
helped me with plants and get me my
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super thankful for... Just like everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all... It's all about helping one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look who you've helped me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much on making hashes and
proper extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really taking a better look at how I'm
growing my trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk so much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you're focused on growing
trichomes more than growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a better look at it 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because you're using just... It's
definitely... Now I'm just... My next
[SPEAKER_00]: videos are all on just... I'm taking my
whole... Everything is going to hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the sounds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to freeze the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the prompt, freeze the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's definitely what's happening
to my entire... This whole plant right
[SPEAKER_01]: here, when it's budded out, I'll show you
on video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be potentially hanging over a screen
and doing some light bouncing of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant over a screen, collecting the very,
very finest that we can, separating any
[SPEAKER_01]: stigmas or systolic hairs, capitate
stalks, pistol-lit hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of those things will get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have the purest of the pure of the
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I'll probably wet
wash the majority of my crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might make a little bit more dry
sift depending.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope that we can continue to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're saying there in the local
papers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of the mayors aren't
taking a look at these small growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing a few plants and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not saying it's legal,
but like ourselves and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a small little medical grows for
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into the whole...
We've talked about this on our previous
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, but pay attention to the courts on
March 18th, and then wait for outcomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the 31st, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just pray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to close here at 420,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our next Puff Wednesday is going to be
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be arriving in... We'll actually be
arriving in Amsterdam for our next Puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next Puff Wednesday could
potentially be in Vancouver, in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three country Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming at you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a nice carb cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the little arrow on the head,
so just in case you slip, you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a... Oh, that watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it just... It's an igloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you did to me the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Bad Boy and the TGA
crew, Subcool, Jill, Ron for growing this
[SPEAKER_01]: great resin here and sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny because he was at my
place when Bad Boy gave him this cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I end up going back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it to John.
[SPEAKER_01]: John takes it to his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He cares for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He cuts them and makes more clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings a couple over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the wonderful thing about
sharing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to extol upon you the
importance of never hoarding genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you seed breeders think it's a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afeard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should share the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the best job you can breeding what
you've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't feel bad if someone takes your
hard work and does something different
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crosses it with something or makes
something that might even be more
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting than the thing that you made
originally with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll be less...
[SPEAKER_01]: nice than what you made originally with
it, but share those genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not hoard strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to claim that this is truly
a medicinal thing and a gift from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from the higher powers,
then it's a great thing to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very happy to be a part of this
little circle of sharing the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got her in a week four flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check her out on John's channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just my name, John Bruffalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Bruffalo on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can usually link it from... I think
I'm following him as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, if you're having a hard time
finding him, you can find him through my
[SPEAKER_01]: channel as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's got some great videos of his crop
on there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm filming it right from... You got one
and I put four in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where this would be right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in week four, out of this bigger,
and just looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think next is Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to see you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably do a little bit of a fun
show of us heading to the airport and eat
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of caramels and being all baked on
the plane and then landing in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have some friends meet
us there and have a big session at the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll jump on a plane and go to
Spain, which will be like a whole other
[SPEAKER_01]: like, OK, now this is it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect that on that flight to
Spain, we'll probably bump into some
[SPEAKER_01]: friends from Amsterdam that are also
heading down to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you guys all soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be well.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
