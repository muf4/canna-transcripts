[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with D420K sitting in beautiful
Lions Bay, BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're about to get it done today,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were playing around a little bit
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of filmed a little bit of a video,
but my neck was completely tweaked out,
[SPEAKER_07]: slept on it the wrong way, and we ended up
having to kind of... I had to just put the
[SPEAKER_07]: video on hold and say another time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our second attempt at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made some nice rosin yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty sticky, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to hit it in the freezer a bit,
but there's some nice rosin there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff is so smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll dab on that as we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of thought after doing what we
did yesterday, I thought of the idea of
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't it be cool to show people
pressing hash, pressing rosin out of hash,
[SPEAKER_07]: but in more than a gram or two of an
amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have the industrial presses.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not even actually doing the teabag
folding yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still doing the original Jeff
Church, wrapping a little bit of hash,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, maybe like less than a half gram
into a ball, and then squeezing that out
[SPEAKER_07]: onto parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were going to see how long it takes
us to do an ounce of rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see what we get out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got a couple of ounces of some
pretty darn nice Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's powdered bubble right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was sandy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sandy when you brought it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just from sitting in the sun, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it'd be easy to work with at least,
eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically what we're going to do is
take you through this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see here on the scale,
I've got just under two ounces,
[SPEAKER_07]: 55.6, 55.8 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very nice bubble, presses between the
fingers quite beautifully, and bubbles and
[SPEAKER_07]: melts nicely in a bowl or on a nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: But today we're going to press it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you want to just kind of get
started?
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you don't contaminate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our pads here for what we're going
to scrape off.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the clean ones, yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our dab tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're short on dab tools, so we're going
to use these for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are the torch, a clean, and then
carry on because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminate the rosin with anything,
any discolor, any darkness or anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it just takes away the beautiful
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well put.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well put.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to grab a dab, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, go right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little hopeless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the whole thing if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get the whole thing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do it right up one big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers, ting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't try that at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm hitting off the titanium DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's a highly educated with a
sapphire insert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the crystal quartz, 14 inch
insert, 20 inch bowl on the ball ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm only going to turn mine on a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using a very small unit, so I also
want to show you today that you don't want
[SPEAKER_07]: to use industrial units, that you don't
need the biggest tools to still be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: press a decent amount of rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of what we wanted to show
you here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now obviously Darren's got the bigger
tool, so he'd probably be able to press a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of a bigger piece and get more
out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using quite a small tool, but I bet
you we still get this done within a half
[SPEAKER_07]: an hour to an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: A decent amount of time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to take us all day by no
means.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think so either.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, I guess we'll just,
I can't believe this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's completely awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I'm just doing small amounts,
half to quarter to thirds of a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a little more than a half
gram to a gram because I've got the bigger
[SPEAKER_04]: tool on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell when you're squeezing it,
when you're not getting anything out of it
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore, you're pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, making rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine takes a little bit of a, maybe like
less than a minute to heat up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually still do a bit of a press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that just gears it up for a good
proper pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some nice sap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sure hear that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little ball of, of goods.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another little squeeze on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm sure that it's not going to,
you always want it to produce a little
[SPEAKER_07]: more, don't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you got to check because it usually
does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that one just squeezed out a little
bit more fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly it's going to be me and Darren
shooting the shit, taking a rip every once
[SPEAKER_07]: in a while and trying to get as much of
this work done as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's slow yet it's fairly consistent work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you're, everything's one
with your surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be soft, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they said there will be salvation,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said there won't be any kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there will be no salvation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come now my brothers all, rally to the
call.
[SPEAKER_02]: My rich men cries are heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hiding men cries are heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then why, then why, why can't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: The poor pain, for the poor they've been
crying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For these many thousand years their
vibrations are traveling throughout this
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come now, brothers all, and rally to
the call.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, hey one, unite the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: One world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sure nice when you've got great
quality resin to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's another reason to probably
why you can hold back on the temperature a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit is because the resin is so high
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good fun making rosin with your buddies
out on your deck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let that cool down for a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks, see, see, do you notice any
difference?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the color.
[SPEAKER_07]: That last shit you had was literally like
dark orange compared to that looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't steady on it, I was just shh,
shh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little bit of pressure, little bit of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then look, this is the steadiest I got
where I actually was holding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's red.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think it's, well it makes sense
that heat is going to affect the resin and
[SPEAKER_07]: the degradation of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that THC degrades into CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some CBN in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, when it comes off in a huge crazy
sheet, sheet it out dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy sheet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know there's a couple of products
soon to hit the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the rosinator, which is a
pneumatic press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then D-Nail also has a product coming
out as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be able to do reviews of both
those products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought before they got here,
I thought what better way to show without
[SPEAKER_07]: rushing, just the speed of what a couple
of guys can do sitting down and pressing
[SPEAKER_07]: out some nice resin just with a couple of,
you know, a really small hair straightener
[SPEAKER_07]: and a large hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_07]: Globs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's producing globs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, globs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing how after I turn this thing
off, it stays hot for like, I'd say five
[SPEAKER_07]: or 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just enough time for me to take a
big ripples.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing that we've made though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't want to weigh all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the freshie?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hit that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hit that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hitting this on the sapphire disc.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, like I was saying, the D-Nail
unit and the rosinator unit are probably
[SPEAKER_07]: should have within the next couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll come back and we'll show you
just how fast you can press out an ounce
[SPEAKER_07]: of rosin with an industrial pneumatic
press compared to, you know, these small
[SPEAKER_07]: little units.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really wanted to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can see right here,
I'd say I've already pressed a decent tiny
[SPEAKER_07]: amount out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me weigh that out real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Must be a few grams here anyway.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like 0.6 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks like a lot of rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more than a point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: All these things are different weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going through that last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be the same one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is probably maybe a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: 28 times more to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got another little bit there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as soon as this lets me, I'll get it
going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yields are just yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They seem fairly decent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep adding them to the sheet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be easy to clean off the dabber,
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hella easy to clean off the dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're small, somewhat easy in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I do that, I guess I better do
another bar grab.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all this rosin stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you must have a whack a hash in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: See,
[SPEAKER_07]: this hash still has rosin in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell the way it's acting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going right back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right back in she goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you we've got close to four or five
grams here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, this is ready to squeeze.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like when it's just nice and lined up
and not trying to move too much in the
[SPEAKER_07]: paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this thing is so hot, I'm gonna have
to take a little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably do a lot of this video in
fast forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like put on a song and just show us in
like way fast forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, every once in a while just showing
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good though, you know, because I hear
a lot of people say, oh, I don't like
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It all tastes like baked weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's that person doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's the worrisome factor of like,
I want to make sure I get it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's that worry that sometimes
pushes through and actually can can ruin
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin where dry sifting works that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to try and get it all?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I want to do is get the best of it
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get it all, well,
that's different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, that's what Martha said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now those of you who read the books of
prophecy, that's what the prophet said.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they all said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And better, gotta come now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better has got to come, but it's only
gonna come starting with you and you and
[SPEAKER_02]: you and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, better, gotta come now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, better has got to come, but it's only
gonna come.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you look at that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Single squeeze.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a very efficient squeeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just never know when you're gonna get
one like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got most everything I've got in
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: One little rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice squeeze on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just heavenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy man, does this pick up wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost like taffy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's going back to more like normal,
but the first few pieces picked up slick.
Might
[SPEAKER_07]: look a little dark on the sheet,
but it'll press out nice and gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't you worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we've had a nice little
small improvement on our technique here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had my wife bring up these little clips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clips for keeping bags closed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had longer ones that we were using,
but these little ones are perfect for
[SPEAKER_07]: keeping the pressing screen twisted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know when you've pressed most of it
out is when it just comes out easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy and not all sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love being able to look into the paper
and watch the hash use out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also find the smaller you use,
like there's those envelopes we were
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about and stuff before,
but the smaller that this is and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: usually working with, the better I can get
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with these clips, your resin doesn't
seem to climb up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least as it does, you can control it
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing I was just literally
noticing online, but I can control that
[SPEAKER_07]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little collections.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like decent amounts for these little,
just less than half gram balls that I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: putting in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to keep an eye on our amounts here.
[SPEAKER_07]: First 15 grams, we collected about 13
grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: So somewhere along the lines, we lost two
or two or three grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're not sure if it was because he
was heating it too hot earlier and
[SPEAKER_07]: steaming it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had quite a bit of grease on quite
a few of these pieces of paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a, we weren't able to get cleaned
up, but man, I bet that we've got close to
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 grams now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven, eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're probably closing in on a,
on 10 grams, which is a, about a third of
[SPEAKER_07]: the way there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been at it for, I bet you close to
an hour now with the turning the camera on
[SPEAKER_07]: and off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if we can't double our,
our, our productivity and see if we can't
[SPEAKER_07]: hammer off the next you know, just under
20 grams.
Just
[SPEAKER_06]: a little dab, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does, especially when you're trying to
talk on camera and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I went and left my thing on here,
so it's going to take me a few minutes to
[SPEAKER_07]: let it cool off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fairly rewarding work when you're
making it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that hard labor wise.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do this job while sitting and
watching movies with your buddies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could have just as easily been sitting
in front of a big screen TV and you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're watching YouTube videos while we
hammer this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really like I would call it hard
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patience times.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty painstakingly, you know,
tedious and slow going, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: rewarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very rewarding.
Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you think about it, like when you
think about the, the cool damn near 10
[SPEAKER_07]: grams that we've made in probably a little
bit over an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not too bad, especially considering
we're using the most, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the smallest of tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't used anything that's a
commercialized or industrialized by any
[SPEAKER_07]: means, not t-shirt pressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just using, I mean, I'm really using
literally the smallest tool that you could
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly use.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just pressed out four or four and a
half grams of rosin just in the span of
[SPEAKER_07]: this video.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got more left in me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to, we're going to continue
down this road until we've got ourselves a
[SPEAKER_07]: nice 28 gram, a nice ounce slab of rosin
for you guys to look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we keep going here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got to fill these things up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fill these slicks up with rosin and we'll
be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snip, snip, snap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because who sits down and rips off an
ounce of rosin with hair straighteners?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absurd.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure there's other people out
there doing it as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hats off to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hats off to those people who are probably
flying to Holland right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Holland flight always goes right over
my nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only know that from being on it,
of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see your place from up there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pretty much see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Rick sent me a picture from up
there last time when he went by my
[SPEAKER_07]: neighborhood to take a picture of this
whole area from the plane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Whoa, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be amazing if we could put all of
this in one single pouch and just go and
[SPEAKER_07]: just have like, you know, 20 grams just
reek out the sides into like little
[SPEAKER_07]: containers and then literally just be
like, boom, okay, that's how we're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it nowadays.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will be how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee you within weeks, if not a
month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say a month maybe we did
lose a little bit of temperature from the
[SPEAKER_07]: sun going behind that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm complaining.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a little longer than we thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been at it for well over an hour
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: An hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been out of two hours at least a
couple of hours, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So a couple of hours, we ended up getting
about a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just under a half ounce right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we figured we'd have a couple of bowls
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Squeeze out maybe a few more of these each
just to get that last little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we found out, well, we just
experienced is with his smaller one,
[SPEAKER_04]: the resin has somewhere to go to without
being on an element as compared to the
[SPEAKER_04]: wider one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not as far of a distance to go to
unless you're using a great big chunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: like maybe a gram, two grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were talking last night,
my buddy was saying he does seven grams
[SPEAKER_04]: squeeze on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven grams?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's he using?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just mean what kind of tool is he
using?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hair straightener and the same way we're
doing it man.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going for the big yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just giving her, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No mess, not messing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have a rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've ripped it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually I won't have too good of one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, that was the whole purpose and then I
got to doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that
[SPEAKER_07]: really squeezed out that last little bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a nice little unit,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's turn mine on again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just turn it to the first setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says it's 365.
[SPEAKER_04]: 365, 392, 419, and 455.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go down to 365, the lowest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that the lowest one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be one of my problems then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you could fix that problem
by simply turning it on and then just
[SPEAKER_07]: turning it off as it gets a little bit too
warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you'd find the super sweet spot
on that thing and be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to go buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's digital that I can control the
temperature completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you get one of these small ones,
you'll be forced to do the turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's why I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go buy the digital because
I'm a turn it on kind of guy and just
[SPEAKER_04]: leave it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I am as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: That variable is just a little too much
with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can still feel how hot that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go grab the rest of the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little bit for you guys at home
to see so far what we've got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little puck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got quite lovely little color on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure how well you guys can see that,
but caramelly and very strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like rock candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You doing one more squeeze there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you between what you squeeze there,
what I've got here and one last squeeze
[SPEAKER_07]: for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you that puts us over our halfway
mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with you and you and you and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, what, what are you going to do
now with a judgment so near that hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me now what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, you see the blood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least we're getting to the 14
mark.
Oreo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Halfway what we kind of hoped we would get
to, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually surprising.
[SPEAKER_04]: We figured we'd be done in 40 minutes to
an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd squeeze out an ounce, but,
uh, you know, we couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do it today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got something.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go eat on commercial drive probably
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good idea too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll probably do a part two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we could do it right out here again,
or maybe we could do it at my apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's hard to beat right here,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I think of all the places we could do
it at, I think, uh, I can picture us back
[SPEAKER_06]: here doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe finishing off on the water with a
big sash.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a plan right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does sound like a good plan for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just squeeze another couple of
points out on the, uh, Roger.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need another point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably an extra point or two.
Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: let's see if this isn't enough right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a sneaking suspicion.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just go kind of behind my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still a little up the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: The street goes up and around behind my
house here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your house is up further up top.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, this is the highest house,
but there's water and some trails and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that go up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus we have all sorts of trails along
lions Bay and other parts of the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have three different hikes that go up
to the lions.
[SPEAKER_07]: One goes up to Mount Brunswick and,
uh, the name of the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this stuff was so nice and,
uh, and soft and workable and I was just
[SPEAKER_04]: hard and crumbly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That son sure does a job on it when it's
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That came off real nice, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: 14, 14, 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the least, uh, in this part,
I will show the slab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get some photos of this and add them
to the end of the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank the four 20 K for, uh,
awesome fucking pressing session and let's
[SPEAKER_07]: finish it off with another bowl,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's finish it off with another bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't tried this yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome possum.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, uh, we did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will, uh, we'll see you next time on
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: My fingers feel like they're going to be
sticky forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthquake, world wind and fire be a
crashing in guessing on you.
Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what gonna do now with a judgment so
near at hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me now what you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a pillow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
