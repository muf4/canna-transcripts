[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, welcome to the Wake and Bake with
Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been awake for a long time,
I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished a very long conference
call with one of the companies that I sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the board, and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting stuff, as always,
but sorry it took so long to get out here,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a couple hours that the chat was
up, and holy smokes, 43, 63 people hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the chat and waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're gonna give away, what did I
hold up today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I held up one of the little,
yeah, it was one of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this guy I was holding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I didn't really have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kinda had a question, but now it's gonna
be real hard because the picture's not
[SPEAKER_00]: there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask it anyway, and we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the bubble bag dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not, I am the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was gonna ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the front page of my picture,
okay, I was holding up that little thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's nature in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something behind me on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was yellow, and if you can tell me what
that was, I would send you this little dab
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone can remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a cooler, it wasn't a cooler,
it wasn't a bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone's gonna be able to
answer this, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, no, there's no way anyone's
gonna remember this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just do a number too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost should have given a little bit of
a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone should have done a little
screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I give some more clues?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it was yellow, and it was a
child's toy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I'm gonna give it to
420wilddragon, because he said a truck,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Tonka dump truck, and that's 420,
you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You win, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might even be your second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember, but either way,
you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one coming to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a toy truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dump truck, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my son's little Tonka truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to see, very tough question,
but hey, 420wilddragon, got one coming at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really cool one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this one up today, because I love
the face on it, the squish, and good
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to the people at Sasquatch,
my brothers and sisters, for always
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking it up and being so kind with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, shall we get our bake on
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for having such a long conference
call once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys were waiting, and I was
thinking about you, but hey, we could have
[SPEAKER_00]: a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't we have a great conversation
yesterday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I got into a lot of the
discussion about bubble hash, and it
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped me, because right now,
Tony and I are designing my new website,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is bubblemanbrand.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go there now, it's just a
passworded page, but eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have beautiful photos,
education from the macro of the seed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through to the resin of the plant,
Tony and bubbleman style, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go hard on it and really put
major, major information into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started writing a blog yesterday in
regards to bubble hash, and Tony just
[SPEAKER_00]: said, hey, how would you write a blog on
teaching someone how to make water hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie, because there's so
many different sizes of kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's properly dried and cured material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's threshing ratios that we spoke
about the other day and how difficult it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to learn about those ratios and how you
really need to make mistakes to learn key
[SPEAKER_00]: things about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ratios, ice, water, versus whether it's
trim or bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to wash differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures, environments outside of the
bags as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too warm when you pull the resin
out, this is going to make it very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: not remove too much moisture so that the
high quality resin self presses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing screen, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through all of this stuff in the
blog, and I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, being able to talk to you
guys has helped me write an even better
[SPEAKER_00]: blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be all up there for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony's going to go through my words and
photograph in the lab that process that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've explained so you'll have a really
high quality photo essay with deeply,
[SPEAKER_00]: deeply informative words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be at bubblemanbrand.com
is where that will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we get ourselves ... Oh,
I've got to turn my timer on for starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri wants to know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to do anything with
you, Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go to my launch pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there'll always be more Tony vids
coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be putting more stuff up for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Coot, keep trying, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to win one of these times,
I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't stop until you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you just never win and everyone's
won three times, I'll just fucking send
[SPEAKER_00]: you something straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just send you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't wait any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're going to grab this
little unit to do a bio essay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've got a double here, a little
double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably can't see, but there is my double
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom and a boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those would be bubblemanbranded,
absolutely, John, but we're going to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was a little ahead of its
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have the infrastructure set up
so that I don't have to basically rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: other people for the infrastructure,
which won't really be a bubblemanbranded
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be like a leased out to
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have the infrastructure,
we're going to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one and two, one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've heard of the ketogenic diet,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting peeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is like my sixth or seventh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of puffs on my conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My conference call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This banger came to me from Mick from DC
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still milking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn near a perfect temp, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hear you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone wants to watch Hash Church be
a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things you'd really have
to be wanting to hear that information to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to sit through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I suspect it could be like a
fish show walking in halfway through the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of an intense tweezer reprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the hard cores, they're going to enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To other people, they're going to be a
little thrown off by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ... Hey, I love fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you love fish sticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little South Park drop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of days to
watch and soak up Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Church is heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation that sometimes gets
created through the dialogue of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information, of the massive amounts of
years that it's taken for the panelists to
[SPEAKER_00]: compile that information, Skunkman Sam
alone, Skunkman Sam alone is worth having
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Church on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd McCormick alone is worth having Hash
Church on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tony Versura.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, chilling like a villain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I am going to definitely be
writing a dry sipped blog as well where I
[SPEAKER_00]: break down as much information about
glandular trichome heads and isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: them without water, but mechanically
mechanical screen separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am excited to get those up in the
very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it's taken this long to
have really great versions of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate, but here it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to Horatio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horatio and I just kind of went our
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just getting along less and less,
I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like, you know, in a negative way,
but just more like our egos were
[SPEAKER_00]: colliding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would talk and we would get into
arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally on our last argument,
it was just like, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just, you be you,
I'll be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against Horatio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved having him on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just could no longer deal my ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just as responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could no longer deal with his ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our egos were no longer able to interact
as we grew together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish him the best, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never want him to be down and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want him to have all the successes that
he wants to manifest for himself and his
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it ran out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe that is my own, maybe it's
more my fault than his.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe my ego was the bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a biased perspective because my ego
is the perspective I look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either way, there'll be more Horatios
in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, what I look forward to Hash
Church and Todd is also sharing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: vision is that we try to bring as many
amazing panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the more people we bring on,
the more likely we are to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys remember Samantha
Elvie, you know, the Wendy Turners,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all of these great people that
have come on over the years, the Jessica
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Jessica talking about her
daughter, Naya, how heart wrenching that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, how we were all tearing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very intense stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for one find that Hash Church is bigger
than any of the panelists anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now its own entity that is a
responsibility to feed each Sunday to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that, hey, let's get some people put
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was great to have Tim Blake
on last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been nice to see Alec from
SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are always hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Brad from Guild Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he had an interesting vision
coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even spoke with the Jungle Boys briefly
and they said they might, if they had
[SPEAKER_00]: time, come on and do a little Hash Church
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some good possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the real Rick Ross, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how we roll on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to bring the faux Rick
Ross on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always with the amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss having Kenny from Trichome Heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Trichome Heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, how am I spacing on K?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy that I'm spacing on Trichome
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome Technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost called it Trichome Heavy
Extracts, which was Jib's and Ken's
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, Trichome Technologies,
which is crazy because that company is
[SPEAKER_00]: like 25 plus years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used to have posters of them on
my wall behind me, but I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have given them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you consume these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you produce yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do produce myself in certain
countries, not in every country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, I have a license to produce so I
can produce right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any plants per se in the
ground, but I'm getting extremely close
[SPEAKER_00]: now as I'm going to put my Reefer Man auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me grab those actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we're talking about them and
it sucks to talk about things and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't show the things that you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here a little bit of motion
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got these four auto
flowers from Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me these as a nice little gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, with Reefer Man,
I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of reminds me of Breeder Steve in
that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much a character, very unique
individual, but always has the flame,
[SPEAKER_00]: always has the super rare exotic,
like low yielding, super rare terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that is kind of what a
Breeder's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the lime and the pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got this unique terpene profile that
I haven't hit in a long time that took me
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up and just left me completely
focused while I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to those particular terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see the value in producing
cultivars that contain all 140 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, instead of the 12 that we seem
to recreate over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we understand the limitless,
endless possibilities of profile mixes
[SPEAKER_00]: that can occur, which should and will end
up creating medicinal and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, unique and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really kind of shot ourselves in the
foot when we fell for the prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: based, how much can I get and how fast can
I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always appreciated the longer flowering
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the 90s, in the mid, early 90s,
I can remember growing cultivars that took
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 to 18 to 20 weeks to bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you would also want to veg
that plant for a little while as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you are welcome for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure, Koo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to be at the Great Canadian
Glass Gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked to Patrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't bought it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't bought a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very organized in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just roll up and be like,
hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about exactly the dates on
that and whether or not I'll be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a little bit of traveling
coming up here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call them Sasquatch pad you're
holding in today's post?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them dab mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a bunch of different
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a mothership one here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little mothership dab mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's silicone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes from the oil slick folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm mostly looking forward to
this haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all auto flowering, which should
be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this haze and this lemon tie from
Reefer Man, he has suggested that both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are going to be right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't be surprised if he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably put these in the ground
in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on how much traveling I
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can take care of them, if I can get
them all sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I go on some cool show or roundtable
to respect you and your contributors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course I would, Louie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of if I have time to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lemon tie is so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos, don't they have more CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's the case with
Reefer Man's autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how he's been producing
these, what his selections have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: what his work has been whatsoever really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a feeling that I will go and
see him in the near future if I'm able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get these into the ground,
it's always a big responsibility when
[SPEAKER_00]: someone sends you seeds that you make sure
you plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got them, don't put them under your
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's trim or bud or some sort
of cannabis product going into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that matter, non-cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use any plant that's creates
essential oils in glandular trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used for water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things from the mint family,
as well as herbamate, herbisante,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even roses I've extracted resin from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos have come along pretty good,
just like LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get invited to Legends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends is pretty easy to get invited to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have great hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually Legends is a around a cannabis
event where people are coming to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll usually have a booth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually you would come up to that
booth and be like, bubble man,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to come to Legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at it, maybe puff a bowl of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be very easy for me to decide
right then and there whether or not you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to be getting the ability to
purchase a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's really what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't get you a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you the ability to purchase
a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way with the ticket purchase,
we are able to rent venues, get caterers,
[SPEAKER_00]: have service, and give everyone a nice
t-shirt that says Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any tips on autos gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have one tip that you don't want to
replant them, that you want to plant them
[SPEAKER_00]: right into their, he told me to plant them
right into their bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tip was from Dank Runner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't top autos and don't stress them in
any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Indra's in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, Indra?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Legends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends of Hash is a party that we,
myself, Skunkman and Sam and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: started a very long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to say 14 or 15 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see if I can get some of
these edits found because if I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends, it would be so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you guys a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just close this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Legends of Hash tickets from
past years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Legends of Hash Thursday,
Tuesday, November 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was during the Amsterdam Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice the no cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not allow cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to bring any phone or
any camera of any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb is the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin is the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Legends of Hash that I did in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another Legends of Hash in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the back of the ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinner and belly dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a belly dancer this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our friend's Lebanese restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really were just allowed to puff
the shit out of this restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could all be really cool t-shirts,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all invitation only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash Yish 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gathering of Charasi Illuminati
connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends of Hash 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real good shit, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gathering of Charasi Illuminati
connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring your own resin and some to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if he sent me all the other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of some of the tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real purpose of Legends and I'll tell
you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting with Skunkman Sam and we
were puffing his Shirok, his 99.9% heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were getting really iry and we were
kind of talking about the cup and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: great about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, I love the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing all these different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are real hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool if we had an event where
just hash smokers went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, yeah, but an event also
where you didn't have to rent a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't promote your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't bring flyers or business cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we didn't even talk business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just milked the fact that we loved hash
and we were all kind of good charsy
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the birth of the Legends
of Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turned more into let's keep
cameras out because some people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming may have done illegal things in the
world of hashish in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also true charsy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so chars is a hand rubbed
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hashish from India or Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure other countries do it as well,
but that's where it was most famous from
[SPEAKER_00]: the chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hashish, that is what the Legends of
Hash party was about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make it not about people
coming and self promoting themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, about trying to
capture parts of it and share it on their
[SPEAKER_00]: social media afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made, that's why most people most of
you won't know what Legends of Hash is
[SPEAKER_00]: other than if you heard about it through
like an Instagram post of say one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's about the only picture
you'll ever see at a Legends of Hash
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really do the cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was for a specific reason,
but it really created a very special
[SPEAKER_00]: event, particularly during big large
events like Spannibus or High Times or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, which are so massively marketed
and sponsored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very much about companies and
money and products and that's not a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this event was one day for all of us
when we were together, those special
[SPEAKER_00]: people that lived their lives in this and
were working for a living in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where we could step back and we
could have a little bit of a night just to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke chars, to eat good food,
to drink good drink, to eat good fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course to smoke great hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just thought, at first they thought I
wouldn't be able to sell 50 tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, I think I'll be able
to sell 50 tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty close towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like five left and finally I sold
them all on the last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it became a thing within a couple of
years that everyone wanted to get a ticket
[SPEAKER_00]: to, which was of course hilarious,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you try not to make it any big deal,
you just pull the people that you feel are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most hardcore hash smokers out of the
group to have a night of enjoying hash
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been illegal for so long that people
feel they have to feel bad about enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke hashish all night at the Legends
of Hash parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go home safely in a cab or on a bicycle
and I end up waking up the next morning
[SPEAKER_00]: early around seven or eight a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick shower, brush my teeth,
a little breakfast, and out the door
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you can't really get that if
you abused, like say, alcohol for a night
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say we abuse it, we really like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a therapeutic, spiritual night
of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I do those yearly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to, Ku.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to do them, but I try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do indeed try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were supposed to do one in Barcelona
this year and it was gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had my place here in Vancouver,
I would absolutely, when I had my gallery,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Melting Point, I would have a Legends
of Hashish every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw three in a row in Vancouver and
it's been a while since I threw one in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver, over a decade in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of thinking, hello Amelia,
I'm thinking maybe Jamaica would be a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends if I could get 100 people to come
to a Legends in Jamaica and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: just make it like a Legends weekend almost
where people come.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logistics are tricky because people
really need to have their own hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally people would come to Jamaica,
they would go find material that they felt
[SPEAKER_00]: was the best that they could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would potentially concentrate or
extract it with whatever process they had,
[SPEAKER_00]: because trust me, a lot of it is there in
Jamaica now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fun to come back and meet each
other all for a celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's not about a competition,
it never really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple competition is that you put
everything out on a table and this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put everything out on small plates on a
table, small amounts of each unique
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar and the one that was gone first
was the one that silently won.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was given the respects was,
oh who brought that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know in Vancouver I brought them all,
so if there were 12 or 15 different kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of melt on the table, I had put them all
there from saving them over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put like five or six grams of each
nice melted part aside until I have 12 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 different ones and then I would do a
big buffet exactly like what Rob just
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice picture of Shiva in the
background and all these beautiful ornate
[SPEAKER_00]: bowls and I gave everyone paper plates
where they could write the names of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivars down and then take a little
scoop out of the bowl and put it next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the name on the plate and you can go back
to your table which was inside my gallery,
[SPEAKER_00]: the melting point, and there were
beautiful roars and glass on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: tables, brand new stainless steel screens
and wicks and anything you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a half a dozen different vaporizers
from the AeroMed from Germany to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Volcano, to the Volitizer, to the Vrip,
it was quite lavish, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite lavish, that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I guess I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys all for coming out and I
still haven't heard from yesterday's
[SPEAKER_00]: winner who won, I guess it was the Dark
Crystal Glass Cleaner, so whoever won
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday, please send me that email and
of course I'll go back, listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: video, make sure it's the right one and
right person, because it's getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like five or six I need to send.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't sent anything since the book,
so I have the book, I have the dab mat
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Volcano Kid, I have like three or
four Sasquatch ones, so I need to go today
[SPEAKER_00]: and send these out, so hopefully I can get
these emails and in the meantime,
[SPEAKER_00]: as always, may the full melt bless your
bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
