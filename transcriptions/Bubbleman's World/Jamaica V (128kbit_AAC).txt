[SPEAKER_09]: So morning morning after our nice long
night and we are is this yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we went through the jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are both empty Yeah, the jack file
and a lemon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we're gonna put some of this
rosin that looks like it's empty into here
[SPEAKER_09]: Which looks like it's empty, but there's
resin and there's turpines in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpines in I want to show you how viscous
it is All right, okay, so let me put it
[SPEAKER_09]: into one of these things There's the turps
See what we got Gorilla glue, sawdust,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me show you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me show you that There we go,
there we go Put the back on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's like perfect even take that away
better Oh god Wow, that's uh pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous So put a little bit of that in
here put it on here let's do it with this
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me show you that little
tiny piece is all we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on Let me see that thing Yeah,
there we go
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom Okay, so it looked empty right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep It really did So just right off the
beginning it's collecting whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: turpines are left on it see how it got
real wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah So there's always gonna be like a
little bit left in there That's why I like
[SPEAKER_02]: to use these jars and hang off And people
like oh that looks empty or you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever but it's You can get a lot out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get another one of these Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the lemon pie.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the Jack Frost you just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And you know, once you once you get
down to the end of it once you get down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of it it's kind of like You know,
you want to get that's just kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: seasoned pan, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at some point it's like okay,
you've tried that whole vial of that
[SPEAKER_02]: straight turp Or you've played around and
mixed with it now It's like it gets really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting when you just take very small
amounts of turpene profiles and mix them
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet it's nice Superfloral flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta get to those empty jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow I convinced you to give me that So
this is all quartz, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon check, what's your OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turp sizzle Actually the sizzle is coming
from your hash because I Saw it did it
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think you got a little moisture
from the freezer
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's the OG you have for that
Lindsey Wow put the Lindsey OG It
[SPEAKER_02]: literally goes straight out your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah some strains go out your ears Some
straight try to go out your chest the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsey goes right literally from all the
way around your From your ear out the
[SPEAKER_09]: brain It's definitely super heavy heavy
like almost light-headed Like yeah as he
[SPEAKER_09]: goes, could you imagine just see it'll go?
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's just on the ground smiling are
you kidding me that was unbelievable Hey
[SPEAKER_11]: guys, welcome to the cannabis cup roots

[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool Tons of action going on in the
street cars all piled up on either side
[SPEAKER_11]: People coming in pretty steadily and we

[SPEAKER_11]: Tony's got the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got our rigs Did you know bring your
regular it's in your back to my back?
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have both our rigs and you did we
did at least a couple hundred people
[SPEAKER_11]: yesterday on the turfs 200 turp dabs 200
turp dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So today we're going to we're gonna double
that up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Awesome see you guys in there Oh
today looks like a pretty busy day You
[SPEAKER_11]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we got to get over to the booth and
start absorbing all these people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that Jenny.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just gnarly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh My god Hey, there's Cameron right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where he's getting our power.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's funny
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys Tweed's booth is gonna be empty for
the rest of the day
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice How's it going?
[SPEAKER_11]: Got some good photos of you yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah Looking right at the camera We're
gonna go to our booth right over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you got a table over there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're sitting at it right now
Yellow bag
[SPEAKER_11]: We got power to we're gonna go plug in
right now and we're close.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see you guys in a bit All right,
where this guy's with the yellow bag are
[SPEAKER_11]: we're gonna be setting up Oh
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh That was Jack
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just They are the flavor and they are
the taste but what we're learning is that
[SPEAKER_11]: they modulate the effects of
[SPEAKER_11]: They're boring one-dimensional and when
you have just a single turkey to it
[SPEAKER_11]: For insomniacs, so there's all of these
[SPEAKER_11]: When we learn how it affects the brain
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be able to hold in on specific
elements for specific profiles
[SPEAKER_11]: So imagine this is a box And imagine if
they were able to be pulled out in just
[SPEAKER_11]: specific amounts to create profiles By
dialing it in to make vaporizing it
[SPEAKER_11]: through your finance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that to me is like a potential future
where specific strains will exist as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the idea of being able to produce
our own profiles and then reproduce them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly,
[SPEAKER_11]: all the turkeys and all these other things
present in that way that we work.
It's got a lot of check on that.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: these are all the insomniacs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the little kind of screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear a drop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody else sells these screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's trade up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's trade up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, go right inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go right in there, girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't hurt you.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: You take this, you fill it with cash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we wrap it in like parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we take a woman's hair straight.
[SPEAKER_11]: A flat iron.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we squeeze this for about 10 seconds
at 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the oil inside the plant or the hash
will squeeze out a golden shatter that is
[SPEAKER_11]: made with no salt.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they can't make it, ladies,
without your hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will respect the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you, this guy buying a hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like, I need this $400 hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, I need the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sir, calm down.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our last one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, I need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I need this.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what I need.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so surreal.
[SPEAKER_11]: High school kids are in a happy place,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because no one was ever able to turn bud
into dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So bud is like bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to roll it in paper and glue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It definitely doesn't get too high.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it definitely alters the effect of the
high you get.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a good way to get medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the dab of making that pure product
that is so pure that you light it and it
[SPEAKER_11]: melts into the liquid, that just becomes
what, you know, that is really the more,
[SPEAKER_11]: the more pure form of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do it that easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't know, I just can't.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I was 18 and I saw this, I would just
be like.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I do?
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep two details, one on top of the
other.
[SPEAKER_11]: One set at $1,100, one set at $5,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm scared to drop it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It alters.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just need some turps.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Love Man's World?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hanging out with Cali Pea at the Fruits
Rastafari Festival.
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been doing lately,
Cali?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay at work, you know, music,
you know, the people that are at work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect, you know, everyone in Jamaica,
you know, history, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get to the turps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a great thing to be able to use
something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just came out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll try to get some on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will turp it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's Jack Frost?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is something extra?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a different strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is basically the first fuel of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the essential oils extracted in a
pure form.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a Jamaican now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that taste on points, or what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, if you're voting, it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Destorada, Bubble Bag, Destorada's
Mothership, Mothership, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_11]: what else.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2015, cannabis cup Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got Bubble Man and Tony Terpenes over
here, pulling the big crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check it out, see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all pure terpenes, the essences
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not the active ingredients,
but they're the smell.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smells and the flavors that we love
about Jaroos.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a natural texture.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no alcohol, there's no alcohol,
there's no salt.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an ITAL, purified turkey.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need more parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blow it on him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow it on him.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not allowed to take part.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can easily blow it by, but it smells
just like what?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the bark.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't really try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to press a little bit out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the name of this place?
[SPEAKER_11]: Fox Creek.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fox Creek.
[SPEAKER_11]: Harborside.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a small amount of ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the world's smallest press of ash
I've ever taken part in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even started this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Hollis Ash
Lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just keep forgetting the other third
band.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's keep playing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's some clear get dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some clear dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take a dab of that over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should take a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should take a dab of that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one left over, given to a 70s
mama.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what turprosing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking four, five, or six star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of five or six.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add a gorilla to the
turntable.
[SPEAKER_12]: In this process, everything that's on the
turntable is coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even in the cooking ash or the grains.
[SPEAKER_02]: This mess does eight bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do the water and the bags,
and then you press through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just press through it, and I press
the ash.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a different process.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a different process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what my other hash looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a turprosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a turprosing butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a chow.
[SPEAKER_02]: One pure molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: One BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chemical burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: One BHO, no alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: All maple.
[SPEAKER_02]: This came from buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a hybridization of three types of
technology.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the ice towel booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're up for the best booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Best product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making the water hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: We make a lot of these dabs and these
products that we're showing you.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the bags we use.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the pipe that we smoke with.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is in its own category.
[SPEAKER_11]: We like the experience here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do what you feel is the right thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't charge anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have them tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a local company in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here to get the turpenes with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: The fresh essence of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at how many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dip in the ice towel hash and rosin inside
the turpenes, and then take it where it
[SPEAKER_11]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the first one to tell me about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to turn this down for you so
we don't kill you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It hasn't been hit on it since it got
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was at 1,000 degrees, and I want to
take you down to like 508 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: Low temp dab for Jack here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be the equivalent of your music
in a hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let this go down.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in the power.
[SPEAKER_11]: We plugged it in.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a steam chalice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the dish clean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Only touch here.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the temp?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me touch the top.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, we're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: You go where you feel it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's make sure you can make it bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no holes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it going first.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a special hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like every flavor anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give him some space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give him some space.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's rock star hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you.
[SPEAKER_11]: China.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Extracted by Smokey.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is getting extracted by Smokey right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be on your lips for like 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 minutes, you'll be walking around
again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now we've got you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just hooked up with these dudes again.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_11]: East London Cannabis Pub.
[SPEAKER_11]: East London Cannabis Pub.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, they've got some nice orange hill
chalice finger rub.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually quite clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not material, plant material that
you would normally see.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't actually smell a lot like
hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's always a good sign as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're going to have to drop this
into the rosin bag and take out what he's
[SPEAKER_11]: got in here already.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiny little bit of resin still in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the one we already ran.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you run already?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it the Nashville 73 micron 70s mama
hash?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I ran 70s mama hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so little there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wait until we're across this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only complicated part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's digital.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking way complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your girlfriend's hair iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Home Depot or Ace's favorite
tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a laser temperature thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to put it in your eyeball.
[SPEAKER_11]: Show them what happens when I shoot.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm folding up the hash in the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would put way more hash in the screen,
but it shows that you could use one this
[SPEAKER_11]: small.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as you sort of fold it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, nicely fold it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a 32 micron.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that should be small enough for Tony to
press out some dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I suspect because it's finger rub,
the heads have all been breached.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been oxidized by the lights and
the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've gotten very dark.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll most likely see a very dark oil
come out of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm excited to see the local rub,
which Jamaican hash always has been,
[SPEAKER_11]: when it's the real deal, not like cut with
breadfruit beach hustler type dudes,
[SPEAKER_11]: but real actual from the farmer,
from the scissors or the knife.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or even back in the day, I remember in the
90s, you could get some pretty good stuff
[SPEAKER_11]: off of the sledgehammers that they were
using to pound herb into tire wheel wells.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would squeeze these little,
they'd hammer it down into little packets
[SPEAKER_11]: and smuggle it off.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good on you, Jamaica, for keeping
people in herb all those years.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so let's get this in the
parchment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Move right into the mill.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll hold the table so we can take the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're using heat and pressure to melt
the hash of the oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have a hash that is not a
dabable product, a hash that's not as
[SPEAKER_11]: strong as you might like, maybe you have a
certain pain that really involves using a
[SPEAKER_11]: more concentrated form, this is how you do
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get, boom, oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Itel oil, no alcohol used,
no solvents used.
[SPEAKER_11]: All we used was heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Tony will clean it up in a second when
it cools off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I usually use like a little, a square
piece of stone, like marble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I cool it in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_11]: I put it in the freezer and when I pull it
out and you put this on top of it,
[SPEAKER_11]: the rosin cools right away and it shatters
and comes off quite nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of cool, almost the reddish
color.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's the tackiness?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it's very tacky and very hard to
get off.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've overheated it, it will often
come off very slow.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well I'm going to have a little
rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out the wires.
All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Completely covered in the flavors of
Tony's terpenes, but still a really nice
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't add any terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole dish is just full of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll have to pass some rips of that
around so everybody can get a try.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was your hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: It stays on the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: It boils off on the screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the little screen that we pressed the
hash in.
[SPEAKER_11]: We smoke in the oil and we melt that in
the hot oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the back of here.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's picking it up right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's better to put it on the tip.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a cold plate.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a bunch of waters too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need a water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys need a dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been getting dabs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been ignoring them all day for
dabs?
[SPEAKER_11]: We might have not given them a set of
dabs.
There's a long line, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: People must have been asking for you and
the ones that got to get dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been wanting to give them a dab
at any point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't seen them and I thought
they were fusing off of it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need a dab, let me know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where did the dab go?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you put it on something?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like a dab, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just made some oil from Jamaican hash
using a woman's hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a laser.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a laser.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here are this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very capital people.
[SPEAKER_01]: What height did you set them up?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that thing was 320 or 110.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here's your dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time you checked, it was 325.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get them to stay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm trying them on and off though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see the diner for a sec?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've got a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the dining brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the little...
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I keep it like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to go right across, right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the middle of the plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's the hottest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where I place the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put the laser down through here,
look.
[SPEAKER_03]: 160, 180, 170.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the heat will actually
interfere with the microwave.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, we've been doing this for hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just giving hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do another run.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing God's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do another run though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do another run.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do another run?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's break another piece of that hash
off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let me do it at another temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do it better this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to squeeze.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can probably get another squeeze out
of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he's got some luck.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's roll that in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see another piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a little piece of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if you don't mind being in the
temper.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I didn't taste it yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seemed really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had terpenes on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the hash is a really nice high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the salt press?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold that up in here maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one has to be empty.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's sticky like this, there's lots of
oil on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just even right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking about pressing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just press it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the same as his?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are both the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put them together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put them in there, which is also the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to do some flowers?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to do some flowers?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably press some flowers, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now we're going to get like,
we're late here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like from 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was right here hitting this pipe.
[SPEAKER_11]: He hit it real hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: He took Jack Frost terpenes with bubble
hash the lady from Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we pressed that into rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we dipped that rosin into Jack
Frost terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what Jack Cura hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that one's Barb.
[SPEAKER_11]: 73 Barb.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all full when she gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've literally given it all away.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had one rip of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was full.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I get one rip and get the gift 50 away,
that's a good day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, the great gardener at Barb.
[SPEAKER_11]: He just didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a woman.
[SPEAKER_11]: A 70s mama.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really cool lady.
[SPEAKER_11]: She learned a bunch of stuff from my
internet channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: And put it all in for me to play.
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically came to show me her product.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great job.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're growing a beautiful herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Processing it into beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then make a trip for it and bringing
it to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it away.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how happy you would be if you
brought your own stash?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then you just give it away.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm giving it away.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is 73, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But not from out here, from Nashville.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of Nashville training.
[SPEAKER_12]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_12]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're going to give the turkeys the
Barb that she gave me.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't turn it upside down until you heat
it up a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't heat it up too much because all the
turkeys will evaporate.
[SPEAKER_11]: They evaporate at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you left it in a pen and put it in
his pocket, and you hit it an hour later,
[SPEAKER_11]: it would just be the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to show off at the start of the
meal, not at the end.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get a bread roll and a little half
with a gravy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a full meal.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a full meal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know what that is?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's having his first turpentine.
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: You like that flavor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to be here in your country.
[SPEAKER_11]: Having this experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I trust me, I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know my son's name is Tosh.
[SPEAKER_11]: You told me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hung out with your mother before she
passed away on the property.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I smoked your brother up with a bubble
hash that I made there on the property in
[SPEAKER_11]: 2002.
[SPEAKER_11]: 2002.
[SPEAKER_11]: I came and brought these bags and used
water and ice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we made bubble hash on the property.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they are?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come back later, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Peter Tosh's first-born son in the
house trying the turkeys and the bubble
[SPEAKER_11]: hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big respect to him, obviously.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter Tosh was the militant man.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the powerful voice of
anti-prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Peter Tosh got his head smacked open
more times than you can count.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was harassed and he was oppressed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's one of the things that if you
listen to Bob and the Whalers,
[SPEAKER_11]: make sure you pull Peter Tosh out of there
and get as many albums as you can,
[SPEAKER_11]: because the music has the most incredibly
powerful message.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he doesn't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the militant man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want each rip to get two or three people
a rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: So whoever goes first, five, six seconds,
that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pass around the next time, 20 seconds of
pure hitting, and this hit will get three,
[SPEAKER_11]: four people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially because we're adding the
turkeys.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not like you'll be feeling like
you didn't get enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, bubble man, who made these turps?
[SPEAKER_11]: These turps were made by Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Tony does the Blue River, the turpene
isolation.
[SPEAKER_11]: He also represents my brand down in the US
through UCan.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be doing collaborations as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll be able to get his turpenes
through various locations.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be able to get my hashes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you'll also be able to get what we're
wanting to put together.
[SPEAKER_11]: As the quiver, I talk about it all the
time, the solventless quiver, with the
[SPEAKER_11]: drys in full melt, bubble hash full melt,
the raws in full melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: And imagine a little bit of turpenes in
there too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that is a product that no one in
America is selling right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's some next level shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And who better to bring it to you than
Tony and myself?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jobless.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, this is sticky.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so sticky it wants to stay on my
finger.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's California Orange OG.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the coupe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know it was Calio.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Supersonic's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the gorilla girl.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys look like you know a gorilla
girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys look like you know a gorilla
girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're supposed to say on point.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're supposed to say on point.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so where are we starting?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start with some people that
haven't.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got people that haven't had hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've had a hit, just step to the back
and let the next throw in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I really want to make sure that
everyone's getting fresh reps.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is going to be a good three-person
rep.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so there it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now pass it over to bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bro on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fingers, that's hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, bro, what have we got?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have we got a normal weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smoked weed in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: 13 for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: I probably smoked a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then one day, I realized what a waste
it was for me to be between my purity and
[SPEAKER_02]: my specialness in the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you got wax there yet?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep asking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a dirty word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: We stay away from the chemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hitting all solvent-less stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we isolate gland heads to 99% using
mechanical dry-sifting techniques.
[SPEAKER_11]: We use water and ice processes to isolate
glands to 99%.
[SPEAKER_11]: We take some of those varieties of hashes
and squeeze them with heat to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are the products, you know,
along with turkey.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's rosin, the thing I just said that
we made with the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: We squeeze it with heat and pressure,
and the oil squeezes out of it,
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're left with a solvent-less oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I sell the bags that make the little
screens that we're pressing the hash and
[SPEAKER_11]: the herb in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I check out one of the bags,
Michael?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, here, check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you selling the bags?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping that I'm going to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on the website right now,
so you can easily order them off your
[SPEAKER_11]: phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've been waiting for my shit for 10
days, and I still haven't gotten it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the call from my guy in Kingston to
see if he's on his way driving here right
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope he is, because if he doesn't
leave until tomorrow, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's going to be bad news.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow's like day three, and I paid 4G's
for a mood to show products and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you can do is if you're enjoying
the turp ribs here and your time here,
[SPEAKER_11]: when you're voting, best booth,
bubble bags, best products, and the
[SPEAKER_11]: mothership Taurus for best hype.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the Taurus for mothership?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the Taurus, the recycler.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get going in here real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our proposition here today isn't money,
but it's to win your vote over by getting
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely low on the products that were
made from these bags and this technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're willing to accept that
contract, I'm willing to dab you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get us up there, get us up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: From where?
[SPEAKER_10]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a friend Eugene in Costa Rica
that's lived there for over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Guanacaste?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he used to run Angel Surf Camp.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was with Julie for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know his wife?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I knew the guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He already came back to the States.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had to go back to the States because he
got some crazy parasite.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had to go see a homeopath in LA.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had like a seven foot parasite in his
colon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven feet long.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was eating raw fish every day for like
20 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Eventually he was like, damn, something's
wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was getting real tired.
[SPEAKER_11]: For a year he was just sleeping all the
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: They take all the energy, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, grab me the camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a little footage here of Coca Rica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dabbers all the way from Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you saying, camera?
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: What up?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hitting the steamers.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_11]: You got some herbs?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hitting concentrates.
[SPEAKER_11]: We took the oil out of the herb with heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: No chemicals, just heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: We squeezed the herb in the hash and made
oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ital oil, no chemicals at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is definitely where it's at right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's in the house.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for stopping by the Fresh Heady's
booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Jamaican first annual Roots Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so nice to see a cannabis cup
happening with a real culture backing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Holland for years we went and it was
coffee shop owners, but it wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_11]: spiritual culture like the Rastafarian
people.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, aye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye and aye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting right after you, go ahead.
Perfect, perfect, ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're about to do a next video,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a coffee?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Okay.
Where are we going to put this?
Where are we going to put this?
Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a good crew here in the fresh
Heddy's tent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go smoking those flips.
[SPEAKER_11]: East London Cannabis Club.
[SPEAKER_11]: Turpines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_11]: We bumped into Franco on the street.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going, Tony?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've probably given out a good maybe two
or three hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to, we have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to be two or three hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's higher, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have been here for hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just not really thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for the win.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Turpines.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you, respect for your work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm from Brooklyn, where I'm here in
Jamaica now.
[SPEAKER_11]: From Berlin?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brooklyn, another Brooklyn in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, another Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm from mighty Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been following three years in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Respect, respect.
[SPEAKER_11]: You going just pure turps?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's pure turps, so it's light.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the essence.
[SPEAKER_11]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're talking about right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely hit at least two to three
hundred people up with turp depths today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went through the Nashville bubbles.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went through the B.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ross.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went through some of the Cali and the
Denver and much, much turpines.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the darkness on this turpine vial
from dipping.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what they look like when they're
pure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very, very clear liquid.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's quite incredible that this has gotten
dark.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're waiting for Bushman and Luciano to
hit the stage, and we're looking really
[SPEAKER_11]: forward to both those performances,
so I'm going to try not to miss them.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a day, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just did it up, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to go around this way now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't there a VIP stand?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, lead me the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude, we smoked out today.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I barely got one in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I barely got one in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably smoked three total.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know who that bubble is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who that they made.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hook up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man, the dude is following us,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, they have bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to smoke their bubble tonight.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: One by time.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my friend Bird Eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's Bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Bird Eye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
Balance.
Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: She said she loved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see when they sing to the princess
them, you know, we're not going to know R
[SPEAKER_07]: &B, so we just take it like a cushion in
the bush, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at her eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she looked very thrilled, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just caught one sign and said,
baby, let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you something.
She said she loved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, my people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, Negril.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling all right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling all right?
Are you feeling all right?
