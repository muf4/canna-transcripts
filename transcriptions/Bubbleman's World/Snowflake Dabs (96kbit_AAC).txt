world everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is snowing like crazy It's been 24
hours or less since I did the last video
[SPEAKER_00]: of being out on my deck and it was
beautiful and sunny and I was sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: my t-shirt and Well, now it's not now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold and snowy and I thought what a
cool little video if we came out and did a
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of contrast video one second All
right, sorry about that had my son in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other room going off So I think we're just
gonna get a dab done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get a little dab off the slab here
That's actually a very large dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say it might be Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not be Exaggerating it's certainly
not going to be the last dab of 2016 as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still quite early on in the day But
it could be one of the biggest of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular day
[SPEAKER_00]: I Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie I was getting a little
nervous as it is snowy out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very very snowy nice big flakes great for
Whistler great for the sea to sky
[SPEAKER_00]: snowmobile People I love watching the the
snow land on my banger and just melt
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately land on my pipe and melt
immediately You know, we got to do a turp
[SPEAKER_00]: dip on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna make sure we Time this

one it dripped over top so we'll make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we get all that cleaned up Thank God for
the DC glass cleaner man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving this shit It cleans glass
better than anything I've seen clean glass
[SPEAKER_00]: yet now only hot hot quartz hot glass
cleans it beautifully Sorry, not hot glass
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you actually put this stuff
onto hot glass I'm sure you'd have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: bad time but quartz and its ability to
withstand thermal shock is as safe as safe
[SPEAKER_00]: can be so I'm gonna call it a day at that
