[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to bubble man's world
everybody we are on a beautiful Sunday
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon Fresh after hash church really
after quite a hash church today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an epic hash church You guys will
have to check it out hash church 86 and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with a samurai Sam from I guess
Up tech Omicron up tech is the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing company utopia planitia
technologies because we're a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: nerds right and w nine tech.com would be
our website Sweet brought a couple vapes
[SPEAKER_00]: by today Mark's been checking out the
Omicron, which is our flagship wax pen
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an 18 mil battery inside and has
four power settings The Omicron is our
[SPEAKER_00]: goal to introduce a really easy to use
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you click it on with five taps and You
can change power settings Adjust it three
[SPEAKER_00]: times twist off the top to access our coil
which has a grade 2 titanium wire wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: around a black porous ceramic wick We also
have other Heating options available
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic donuts were discussed today on the
church Yeah, there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things you can do with the
Omicron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes with the glass globe Yeah,
I've got the glass globe on mine right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass globe So you can see your vapor
production super easy learning tool really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to learn how to use the unit pretty
important for this unit I'll have you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: know because it's not just a vaporizer
that you're gonna buy and just use out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the box They're sort of trying to create a
little bit of a better product something
[SPEAKER_01]: longer lasting something a little bit more
sustainable and Non, you know constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: replacing and so one of the important
things about this unit Which Sam just
[SPEAKER_01]: really told me about today was the actual
cooling of the unit once you've hit it a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch and you've heated it all up You
really want to cool the unit down and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was showing me by just Taking dry hits on
it Just a couple of dry hits pulls though
[SPEAKER_01]: the cooler air through the chamber and it
actually cools that little element and
[SPEAKER_01]: most importantly it cools the Oil because
those three little holes that were sucking
[SPEAKER_01]: through if you heat that oil up too much
and you let it sit The oil will actually
[SPEAKER_01]: drain down into those holes and kind of
clog it up a little bit so definitely an
[SPEAKER_01]: important factor to pay attention to One
of the nice things I like about this pen
[SPEAKER_01]: and we spoke about it on hash church where
samurai came on and discussed the
[SPEAKER_01]: different qualities of Components that are
being used in these different pens and
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing out how we were all very obsessed
about The grade of titanium if it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: electric nail some of us weren't even
hitting titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were preferring different forms of
ceramic silicon carbide Quartz getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into sapphire and he just pointed out like
you guys will hit all these incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: different surfaces But what about all
these pens?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just hitting any Chinese rebranded
pen That's nothing against China when I
[SPEAKER_01]: say a Chinese rebranded pen It just
happens to be where the pens are from I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't talk smack about our people And to
be upfront we have art it most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: devices are manufactured in China as well
But they're manufactured in our faculty
[SPEAKER_00]: using materials that we've carefully
selected and we want to make sure we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting only really safe Materials inside
the heated air path of these devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well when I had mine I did it wrong I put
too much terp sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all drained down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It completely coated the unit It wasn't
giving me a full rips anymore Sam walked
[SPEAKER_01]: me through troubleshooting when I pulled
the element out and I took it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: came apart because I had so much oil in it
and I The way I was twisting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had twisted the piece out of it I was
amazed at how it was so simple It wasn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of like it wasn't like a bunch of
stuff that I didn't know what it was It
[SPEAKER_01]: was just junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the ceramic dish There were the
two little wires and there were the
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and that was it We actually call
this the kiss cartridge for keep it simple
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid because simplicity leads to a
beautiful design That doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: extraneous materials a lot of which are
unsafe Your cartridge came apart because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not using any glues or nickel mesh
to attach any of this stuff inside here
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just titanium wire, but it also went
back together just as easy exactly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know The only reason it came out don't
get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't fall out I was pushing paper
towel and wiping all the oil that I that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had done off of it and I didn't realize
Some had pushed onto the inside and was
[SPEAKER_01]: spinning the inside compartment which
finally released and came out but
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I've had an amazing time at
this pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken it to Jamaica I've taken it to
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's traveled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it hasn't caused me any problems at
airports or at security so that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: good and Yeah, it's it gives a really
tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are these available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our websites w9tech.com you can buy them
directly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in smoke shops across the country
and a bunch of different online retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: to Omicron comes in three different
battery sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the smallest light duty 900
milliamp hour model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're both rocking the HD 2100
milliamp hour And then you have one in
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two and there is a midsize
which yeah I didn't have out at this
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, but there's a 1400 and in between
medium duty size, too So what does that
[SPEAKER_01]: mean to the average person?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of timeline are they gonna get
with this versus this on using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a hard question to answer
because it totally depends on how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: vape So for somebody that's only taken a
couple hits a day This can last a day or
[SPEAKER_00]: two between battery charges if you're a
heavy vapor and you're using this thing 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 15 sessions a day You might want to
step up to the biggest battery size But
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just take this one to the concert
that night small in the pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'll be honest with you I dab a
lot so I have a email at home and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: using this as my only device and when I
originally got my vape I thought the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest one's gonna be the best and after
a week of not needing to charge it I asked
[SPEAKER_00]: for the smaller one and this is the one
that I use the most now just because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really pocketable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense Well, we should maybe
load a couple of these up for sure take
[SPEAKER_01]: take a few tasty dabs We were making some
rosin earlier Had a nice Actually had a
[SPEAKER_01]: really unique blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have much to press for rosin So I
just used some five and six star West
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast concentrate bubble hash and It came
out beautiful the rosin actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of the rosin right here It
just happened to release bubble hash into
[SPEAKER_01]: the rosin and I'll show you actually you
can see it dripping out of the thing right
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the top left You can see how the
bubble hash is getting thicker and darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the rosin still separated Really
nicely and we were able to get a really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice pure product out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we Why don't we hit some of
this pure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I'm not sure if it's gonna shatter
like it was when I was collecting it or
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the deal, but It was really pretty
There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir Put a little in mine as
well Yeah, I really love these little
[SPEAKER_01]: units for you know, obviously out and
about in the world, you know Where the dab
[SPEAKER_01]: and and I do still carry with me my
mothership and my D nail and sometimes a
[SPEAKER_01]: battery and so I'm always ready for a
serious session If you've got room for a
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelican why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have a pocket this might fit you
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you one thing for
traveling This is unparalleled when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling It is so nice to be able to have
this unit especially across Canada because
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually leave it dirty and have it
filled Not a problem when I can't you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's nice to be able to have
different elements travel with clean ones
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave dirty ones behind and just use them
when you get back to that country So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my setting on blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty serious blue is the highest
setting The taste on that's real nice So
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're using harder rips when you're
drawing harder the higher power settings
[SPEAKER_00]: work better and if you're gonna use lower
power settings You've got to really milk
[SPEAKER_00]: it and breathe very gently to get those
turk which is quite counterintuitive to a
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer or A cannabis user who's used to
smoking or taking bong rips or dabs It's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to wrap your head around the fact
that you need to really pull gently and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's much like the Jamaican steam pipe
one of the original the original
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporizer, you know, you don't want to
pull too too hard, but Definitely just
[SPEAKER_01]: hard enough to get that sweet spot When
you get it right so so good Agreed very
[SPEAKER_01]: decent very decent So that is the Omicron
pen the one that I've definitely been
[SPEAKER_01]: using for the last few months and getting
used to We're also going to cover the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hercules oil cartridge today, which is you
know from my perspective of just learning
[SPEAKER_01]: about this It's seemingly like the
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the bubble bags of oil cartridges
Not needing to be replaced warrantied Even
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed if need be definitely there's a big
difference Discrepancy between you know an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy-to-use vaporizer like this and a
serious tool and the Hercules is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: special case product it's for somebody
that really consumes a lot of oil and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want a Professional-grade tool to put it
to use something that doesn't break down
[SPEAKER_00]: and require replacements So what we think
the Omicron is a super high quality device
[SPEAKER_00]: The coils inside will burn out eventually
and need to be replaced and the Hercules
[SPEAKER_00]: Was a ground-up approach to make a device
that didn't require replacement parts
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have pieces that burned out So
which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you guys What's inside the
Herc yeah, he's gonna show you and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: also going to photograph What's inside the
Herc and show you with inlaid pictures as
[SPEAKER_01]: we always do here on bubble man's world To
show you just how you know it's it's quite
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few pieces yet It's quite
a simple unit in the sense that each one
[SPEAKER_01]: of them comes apart quite nicely And you
can get a nice overview of all the pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly it's a purpose-built machine
It's kind of complex, and we don't intend
[SPEAKER_00]: this to be the we don't intend it to be
the advice of an everyday vaporist It's
[SPEAKER_00]: for that 10% of people that really want a
serious tool that don't mind cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally and the trade-off there is
that if you Maintain this device properly
[SPEAKER_00]: it can last you for years you can put
hundreds of grams through they not need to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy replacement parts and Get a really
really flavorful performance out of it So
[SPEAKER_01]: you tell us a little bit about the inside
of the unit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it so we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stainless steel housings and these are
called the heater core We have the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: heater core and the lower heater core and
the upper heater core is where you load
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil into There's also a ceramic rod
placed inside the center of it You can
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the ceramic rod and this heating
unit actually comes with a warranty
[SPEAKER_00]: Disassemble this all the way so you can
see inside Well, yeah a couple extra
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces there It's quite incredible when
you see the whole thing taken apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you look at each component What each
thing does and there's a ceramic rod
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly none of these were off-the-shelf
components They're all designed for this
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose chamber goes inside, and then you
place this wick inside which fits around
[SPEAKER_01]: the rod And this almost looks identical to
the pad that volcano did years ago for
[SPEAKER_01]: their The volcano vaporizer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they did it out of
titanium right they were doing stainless
[SPEAKER_00]: steel So this is v2 yeah, and we did a
stainless steel mesh a couple years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we made the grade 2 titanium
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit better flavor So the
rest of the Hercules is there to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: supply power to the bottom of the ceramic
rod so that it can heat up and It's really
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely well made though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you What do we have one loaded up
that we can rip array we can put this one
[SPEAKER_00]: to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our newest version of the Hercules comes
in a 510 threading so it's compatible with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different box mods out there And
it can run 20 to 35 watts is our suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: operating range I'm going to pop an
optional accessory on this is a bubbler
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have called the nibbler XL the
nibbler XL check This out So this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that I've been using for a number
of years before I became an employee I put
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple hundred grams through my herc and
became an evangelist and then decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread the word The nibbler XL will put
this guy to work as I mentioned a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: our products are made in China This is one
of the things we make in America by
[SPEAKER_00]: American scientific glassware
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet So Sam was telling me while we had
the camera off briefly that he has put
[SPEAKER_01]: over 250 grams of oil Through this
particular cartridge right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is his Hercules This is the one that
we have all apart and the one that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be photographing So when I
photograph it and you look at it And you
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it's a brand new thing you can
understand that this is just a cleaned
[SPEAKER_01]: product that Sam has used hundreds If not
over a thousand times definitely for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years I've been using the same one
and I think the only pieces I've replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: in this unit are the little PTFE
insulators here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are used Keep positive and negative
separate and we sell rebuild packs for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 pieces for 10 bucks something like that
It's close but there's not too many parts
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to be replaced these bottom
insulators are Semi consumable item,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you are using the nibbler
You can wear those out and need a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're $10 So the majority of the
components in here are really made to last
[SPEAKER_00]: and we even put a one-year warranty on the
heating rod inside Wow, those are tasty
[SPEAKER_01]: tasty delicious rips you can definitely
tell this is a serious unit This is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: unit that you're going to buy and not take
seriously you have to clean the unit you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to maintain the unit and You have to
cool the unit down unless you want your
[SPEAKER_01]: oils to be dripping down into that lower
compartment It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn how to use it properly
This is not as easy to operate as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Omicron Has a specific usage technique you
need to do draws to preserve the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep air flowing through it so that
oils don't cook up top and lose potency
[SPEAKER_00]: and lose their Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll take right now He's drawing on
it without pushing the button and what
[SPEAKER_01]: he's doing is he's cooling the oil Inside
the chamber so it doesn't degrade to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point of all full terpene loss And so
you're hitting this really generic sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: reclaimed to tasting Rips exactly we have
airflow engineered through the Hercules to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool down the rod cool down the metal
coils and re-solidify your oil so That you
[SPEAKER_00]: can load a half gram at a time inside a
coil and it tastes good in the first hit
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 10th hit and the 20th hit and as
long as you Maintain that buffer load
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the coil and keep it saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor stays good It doesn't degrade
like after three and four hits on the coil
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put ten drops of terps in there,
too So we're going strong here for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice unit that's a serious unit
that is not like Just to lay with my wife
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just want to take a little dab I
want to go for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's like a whole different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's a medical unit Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean people that are in chronic pain
that require dabbing to reduce their pain
[SPEAKER_01]: We have they could definitely get their
pain reduced Oh, I think I've definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to our customers some of whom have
been in hospital and they've brought
[SPEAKER_00]: Hercules inside to Medicaid when you know
They're basically not able to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need the device for pain management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're definitely trying to make
really top quality components not beating
[SPEAKER_00]: around the bush with Anything that could
be unhealthy or deliver a less than five
[SPEAKER_01]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's quite an incredible unit And I
guess it can fit on a variety of bases
[SPEAKER_00]: sure any five ten threaded mod So standard
issue box mods these days and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly low power requirements So 20 to 35
watts nothing fancy needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm We are working on our own vaporizer
that will have a few fancier functions
[SPEAKER_00]: than the ESEC boxes that are out there Or
to come on that down the road walk us
[SPEAKER_01]: through the components one by one And what
I'll do is I'll show the close-ups of them
[SPEAKER_01]: as you're talking about it So just talk
about each one of these little definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got going on Maybe the best
thing to do would be to start with the
[SPEAKER_00]: instruction manual make sure I don't miss
any beats There you go So the hurt does
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of components and it also comes
with instructions that show how all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are put together Great
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you And so we start at the bottom
This is in the inner core.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows power to transmit to the
ceramic rod The ceramic rod is gonna sit
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the upper chamber, which is where
the oil coil is installed into And this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what wicks and feeds oil into that ceramic
rod So this slides inside There's an
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustable airflow washer that will go on
the bottom so that you can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction it kind Of acts like a carb
cap Then you've got to set that manually
[SPEAKER_00]: once it gets a little sticky with the oil
you were mentioning It's an optional piece
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly and you would basically wait for a
little bit of oil to get through and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can stick it to Uncover or cover the holes
if you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use my Hercules without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my personal choice I think it's a
bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe without the bubbler You might want
to happen to have it turned on a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more who knows possibly there's a million
different preferences out there and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure the Hercules is a
flexible device so that different people
[SPEAKER_00]: with different preferences can do whatever
they want to with it Just like the Omicron
[SPEAKER_00]: has four power settings So it works for
people that want to take a really light
[SPEAKER_00]: rip or a thicker one Hercules has a lot of
flexibility, too This is the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: insulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you thread the assembled heater core
onto this and then we have PTFE heat
[SPEAKER_00]: shield threads on the outside of it
There's a top cap that goes inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: this seals the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that screw on or just pop on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a press fit and it does get
sticky with oil So it won't fall out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there once you've used it and then the
mouthpiece threads on top or optional
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbler attached exactly or the nibbler XL
mouthpiece replacement piece Excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool the way you can take that
whole unit apart 100% see every component
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I'm just really stoked on that
because these vape pens to me were always
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a mystery I always wanted to be
like, well, what's what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is we can do some work to de-nistify
all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, I think the way you guys have
shared and are showing Your product is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a good way of leading
yourselves down that road of
[SPEAKER_01]: demystification And it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've managed to I've personally hit full
melt dry set full melt bubble and rosin in
[SPEAKER_01]: these units the Hercules is a serious unit
in the sense that it will Rage through
[SPEAKER_00]: full melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one device we make that's
intended for contaminant laden hashes So
[SPEAKER_00]: Omicron works great with oils and with
rosins, but anything with contaminant It
[SPEAKER_00]: will build up on the wire and you have to
clean it off Yeah, you get a crust over
[SPEAKER_01]: the wire and obviously you don't want to
be you know, brushing it too too difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: You could damage the coil by trying to
flake that crud off You can damage the
[SPEAKER_01]: coil at the same time from my perspective
at the price that you guys sell these
[SPEAKER_01]: coils at which is Is it $12.95 for $12.99
for one right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We you know, you have discounts 20% listen
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are Borderline replaceable in the
sense that you just I'm very happy that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a few extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't replace Them all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean mine as I can but when one goes
it's so nice to just And roll in a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're totally cleanable So if you
have a couple of them, you can soak some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them in isopropyl alcohol use your one
and then when the other ones get clean
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle them out Yeah, I know totally so
very cool But the Hercules is awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its design you can soak all the
parts in isopropyl alcohol You can boil
[SPEAKER_00]: them and the grade 2 titanium coil will
get a little buildup from contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're putting bubble or dry
sift in there However, you just hang that
[SPEAKER_00]: off the end of a grade 2 titanium dabber
hit it With some heat you're gonna take
[SPEAKER_00]: all the carbon off and then the rod can be
self-cleaned You just apply power when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've rebuilt your herc So the whole
thing is completely user serviceable It
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't require any replacement even if
you're putting really dirty material
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty fucking awesome,
dude Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put straight Unscreened or sorry I
should say unsifted Keith just out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of a grinder with tons of
contaminant it so like 1% melt Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just cleaned it up afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still give you a tasty rip
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's great man, I'm really stoked
on seeing how this moves forward in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future I love the idea of these pens just
getting more and more conscious and and
