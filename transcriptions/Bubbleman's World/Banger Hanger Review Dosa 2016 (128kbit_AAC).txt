[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I
am back at high integrity glass art for an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute Heater of a review we've got now
for the last 10 minutes off-camera I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trying to remember all of the names
of this pipe So we went online and we
[SPEAKER_00]: found emerald glass actually who has a
similar piece Has written pastel rainbow
[SPEAKER_00]: ready sleeved over fire and ice re
wiggies, so this is obviously a dosa aka
[SPEAKER_00]: the Banger hanger, which I really kind of
like that nickname piece is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful the chug on it without the
banger in it Serious I don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of perk he's got in here But all
I know is there's nothing blocking the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthpiece from the perk and you get no
water Even touching your lips in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how hard you pull Quite a bit of
reduction once you get the banger in there
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really see it and hear it you can
almost feel like it's a like a silencer
[SPEAKER_00]: has been put on the piece I've got some
beautiful Cookies Roz in here that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be hitting up I've already got a
little piece on the dabber and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't help myself so I dipped into the
Into the grape ghost blue River terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: for the wind so Without further ado this
piece is just beautiful Dosa man,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're killing it, bro There's no doubt
about it, and I'm really stoked like high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity glass art is Nearby and I'm able
to always visit because I myself don't
[SPEAKER_00]: collect pieces on this level anymore not
since the late 90s So it's really quite an
[SPEAKER_00]: honor always to be able to come and and
hit a piece like this I mean my god look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely beautiful Oh,
yeah, just hitting it dry brings me joy
[SPEAKER_00]: come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous All right here we go
This part I'll probably edit out because I
[SPEAKER_00]: hate the sound of the torch
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that right about the tip like
that I Read a little article where they
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about the hottest part of the
torch Closer no, I just go side to side
[SPEAKER_00]: then up, but that's fine Your banger
That's fine banger etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that nickname that the banger
hanger good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little timer risky Gotta have
your timer on these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for the iPhone And I've been
told a good 55 seconds Heating this banger
[SPEAKER_00]: up and waiting about 55 seconds gives a
really nice not too hot not too low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature Temp dab but something that
will be quite substantial I'm sure got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab on the dabber right there with
a nice selection of blue river terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure we're gonna go through
this entire Group of terpenes right after
[SPEAKER_00]: we finish this quick little video of this
little review of the dosa banger hanger
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of how many How many layers he's
done here is is really quite incredible I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I've always just been impressed With
even single layers of ready wig wags to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how tight the lines can get but once
you start Overlaying them one two three
[SPEAKER_00]: deep it it just becomes a whole a whole
different dimension to the art So pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this
[SPEAKER_00]: Bet you guys are peeping this carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a special dosa carb cap totally
joking We don't have the carb cap right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using this
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a little JS technique there moving the
moving the dab around God when you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that So perfect and it just cleans to just
perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you want your banger looking
after you have a nice dab right there
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice Well, that was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like we can't just do a one dab
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably gonna have to hit something
else we've got a little bit of the Lindsay
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we've got some Congo and we've got
some Pink I said we go pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh pink pink hush for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, that's that's looking right
proper right there you guys can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: oh Yeah, oh My gosh just beautiful All
right, well, let's get ourselves one more
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab here for the for the dosa
review so far I'll say the pipe feels
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible in the hand really nice feel to
it Obviously before you touch the pipe you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it and you're realizing right away
that this is This is a serious piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on point artistically The work is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reddies and the wig wags are
completely Ridiculous and I'm also really
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressed with how well it feels
When hitting it with and without the the
[SPEAKER_00]: banger So let's get another turp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the great ghost that we just hit
I've got AC DC I've got kush cleaner and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm gonna have to go with the kush
cleaner pink kush and the kush cleaner are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna create a really nice Aftertaste that
is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get that in there get that
nice cushy Taste in the back of my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll do this again That
[SPEAKER_00]: fits great in the hand I'm really loving
the fact that the pipe blowers the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers are making pipes a lot smaller
these days When I first got into this in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid 90s early 90s Pipes were much
bigger when I got into Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course Ruhr's were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had big 18 eight glass on glass
connections that were you know designed
[SPEAKER_00]: for Buds to be shoved into into the bowl
and and go like that Since then even
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like Ruhr have been creating
more and more reductions smaller carbs
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller glass joints and Just making
everything a little bit tighter You can
[SPEAKER_00]: see quave with his banger and how he's got
a really nice tight tight area that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down and opens into a 14-4 I think there's
something to be said for not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of where he's put that tube in
the top of the banger but For the size as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really feel it when you take a hit
and obviously you get used to your
[SPEAKER_00]: different bangers and it's it's not quite
the same when you hit a pipe without one
[SPEAKER_00]: at the 32 second mark and we're gonna hit
our final rip of the The banger hanger
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful job dosa and yeah, if you want
to I don't even know if it's for sale I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess in a sense every pipe is kind of for
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a high integrity glass art who is
currently holding and Admiring and loving
[SPEAKER_00]: this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, 55 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow the terpenes on that were incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: a Real take your breath away moment wasn't
almost anticipating the strength of those
[SPEAKER_00]: kush cleaner terpenes interacting with the
pink kush That went deep Probably gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: cough for the next five minutes Five or
ten minutes, so I will bid you all adieu.
