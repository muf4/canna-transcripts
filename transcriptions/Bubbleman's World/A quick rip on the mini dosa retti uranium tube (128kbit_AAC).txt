[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here with this beautiful little,
I wouldn't really call it a mini tube,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is quite a small little mini dosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got beautiful uranium work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see with the little black light
how it lights up the green colour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all through the body of the pipe
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as on the honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought we'd take a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always excited to see another beautiful
piece cross my path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And always happy to share it with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice little chubble on this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hits really beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downstem is also uranium and looks,
as the owner pointed out, like the little
[SPEAKER_01]: vial from the Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The radioactive vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the optimised flavours sewn
somewhere, but I misplaced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that hit was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that was, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hit with it next time.
Thanks for watching.
