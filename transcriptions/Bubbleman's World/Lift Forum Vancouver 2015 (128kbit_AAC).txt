[SPEAKER_10]: There is going to be a post-forum event,
and the Canadian National Medical
[SPEAKER_10]: Marijuana event after this, and it's going
to be at the Blackbird Public House,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is at 905 Dunsmear, so it's a couple
blocks away.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will say that again, because I'm sure
no one will remember what I just said.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well, I'm sure you'll notice that we
don't have any representation here from
[SPEAKER_10]: Vancouver Council, and we did invite them
to come, but unfortunately because of the
[SPEAKER_10]: consultation process that they're in right
now, they can't come to events.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can only come to their own
consultation.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not my rule, but that's the message
that we received, so they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_10]: come.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to start off by acknowledging
our sponsors, so Ample Organics,
[SPEAKER_10]: the Canadian National Medical Marijuana
Association, Sante Cannabis, Canna Pro,
[SPEAKER_10]: and Tilray.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to acknowledge the rest of the
LIFT team.
[SPEAKER_10]: Neither of them are here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Tyler.
[SPEAKER_10]: And David is very incognito.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've had a chance to meet David,
consider yourself lucky.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like beating a microphone.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't met him, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to get a picture and post it up
here later.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in terms of how the layout of the
evening is going to go, we'll start out
[SPEAKER_10]: with three speakers who are going to
speak.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to move into a panel,
which will be moderated by the beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you don't have to look at me for much
longer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to start out by introducing
our first speaker.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jonathan Zade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan Zade is a third-year knowledge
integration student at the University of
[SPEAKER_10]: Waterloo.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know Jonathan's going to like me
saying this, but he's 22 and possibly the
[SPEAKER_10]: most adorable person in this room.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's done some really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been suffering from new daily
persistent headaches for eight years,
[SPEAKER_10]: which causes him to chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And after trying numerous pharmaceutical
therapies and interventions, Jonathan
[SPEAKER_10]: finally gained some relief from medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: He has received much media attention
recently for successfully winning his
[SPEAKER_10]: claim for medical marijuana insurance
coverage.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe you're the first in Canada
to get that sort of coverage.
So awesome.
In December 2014, he found himself...
[SPEAKER_10]: In December 2014, he founded a patients'
right group called Canadians for Fair
[SPEAKER_10]: Access to Medical Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: CFAM aims to help others navigate and
ultimately improve the issues and
[SPEAKER_10]: challenges associated with the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jonathan, did you get to come up here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd particularly like to thank LIT for
organizing this wonderful event and Felipe
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas and Tilray for making it possible
for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: On April 22nd, 2007, at the age of 14,
I woke up with a headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, at the age of 22, I woke up with
that exact same headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: This constant unremitting neurological
condition known as new daily persistent
[SPEAKER_03]: headache is said to be one of the toughest
pain conditions to treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first, the headache was so sensitive to
noise, I could barely leave the house and
[SPEAKER_03]: was forced to drop out of grade eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: My high school experience consisted of
going to a school where I worked
[SPEAKER_03]: one-on-one with a teacher and would go
straight back home.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put it simply, I had no quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there were no known treatments
or cares, doctors prescribed me 48
[SPEAKER_03]: off-label prescription pharmaceuticals as
well as multiple other therapies and
[SPEAKER_03]: interventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had heard medical marijuana could be
useful for people in chronic pain and with
[SPEAKER_03]: migraines, but there was no evidence of it
working for my physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, I was young, so physicians
were unwilling to hear me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: After moving to Waterloo, Ontario for
university, I decided to give marijuana a
[SPEAKER_03]: better try and obtained it from dealers
and for the purpose of treating my
[SPEAKER_03]: headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some weeks, my dealer would have
strains that helped tremendously,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he would run out of them the next week
and I couldn't rely on his illegal source
[SPEAKER_03]: of apples for my medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard stories in the news about the
introduction of the Marijuana for Medical
[SPEAKER_03]: Purpose Regulations, BMMPR, and waited
until April 2014 to find a physician who
[SPEAKER_03]: would be willing to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: On April 22, 2014, my seven-year headache
anniversary, I received my first
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I initially struggled with access through
the MMPR and found my original licensed
[SPEAKER_03]: producer unable to supply enough medicine
to all of their registered patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: My physician left his practice and
transferring to another licensed producer
[SPEAKER_03]: was prohibited under the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around the same time, I realized my bills
for medical marijuana were adding up to be
[SPEAKER_03]: more expensive than any student could
reasonably afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 48 drugs I tried before receiving
medical marijuana cost me nothing out of
[SPEAKER_03]: pocket as my two health plans paid for
them with no question asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though medical marijuana was cheaper
than many of these drugs, it personally
[SPEAKER_03]: was costing me much more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: After making a few calls, I quickly became
aware that the insurance company staff had
[SPEAKER_03]: no idea about coverage of medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that because it had no drug
identification number, they couldn't add
[SPEAKER_03]: it onto their plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Access to medical marijuana is a right,
but it seemed like few patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: including myself, were able to pay for
this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I submitted a restricted drug use form to
the University of Waterloo students health
[SPEAKER_03]: plan committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, they were completely opposed to
the idea of covering medical marijuana for
[SPEAKER_03]: a student, but after some convincing,
they agreed to a meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came back to the meeting prepared with a
speech and evidence to back up my claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: The evidence included studies on medical
marijuana and chronic pain, a sleep study
[SPEAKER_03]: report showing clinical signs of
improvement while on medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: and letters of support from various
healthcare practitioners.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next six months were full of emails,
calls, promises, and disappointments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to convince the health plan
committee that medical marijuana was an
[SPEAKER_03]: affordable drug that should be treated
like any other prescription that is
[SPEAKER_03]: typically covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: This past December, the University Health
Insurance Committee finally came to the
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusion that medical marijuana should
be treated like any other prescription
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical drug and decided to cover
it under the student health plan through
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunlight Financial.
[SPEAKER_03]: When analyzing the case, the university
looked at three things, cost, use,
[SPEAKER_03]: and public response.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought the cost of medical marijuana
team from licensed producers was not only
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable, but inexpensive compared to
other pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The school concluded that my medical
marijuana would be beneficial to my
[SPEAKER_03]: academic success.
[SPEAKER_03]: They realized that the reaction by other
students and the public could be perceived
[SPEAKER_03]: in a negative way, but they decided to
side with me, and in the end, my peers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the community were unquestionably
supportive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was ecstatic that the student union
agreed to cover it, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew many other people under the MMPR
were struggling to afford their
[SPEAKER_03]: medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my heart, I knew it wasn't right that
people were choosing between buying their
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine and their groceries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to start a federal non-profit
patients' rights group called Canadians
[SPEAKER_03]: for Fair Access to Medical Marijuana,
or CFAM for short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the insurance story was featured in
national media, CFAM and my cost coverage
[SPEAKER_03]: advocacy work has taken off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients across the country have contacted
me, and many of their cases are looking
[SPEAKER_03]: quite promising.
[SPEAKER_03]: This silent revolution of medical
marijuana insurance coverage is just at
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cases that I'm helping with will set
precedent for many other patient
[SPEAKER_03]: categories such as union workers and
disability recipients.
[SPEAKER_03]: By working with various support
organizations, like Tilray and Lyft,
[SPEAKER_03]: we will work towards getting medical
marijuana treated like any other
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also serve on Pedraken's patient
advisory board run by Hilary Black,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a useful tool that allows
patients to give feedback to their LP.
[SPEAKER_03]: CFAM is also working with Raelle Kapler
and Philippe Lucas on merging some of
[SPEAKER_03]: their resources from their old
organization, Canadians for Safe Access,
[SPEAKER_03]: with our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Albert Einstein once said, It's not that
I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with
[SPEAKER_03]: problems longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the key to success for patients
going through the insurance coverage is
[SPEAKER_03]: persistence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to respect the system,
but you can't let it hold you back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some patients aren't aware of how to be
their own advocate, and that's where CFAM
[SPEAKER_03]: comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: By joining us for free at CFAM.ca,
you'll be updated of any progress and will
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to access the resources we're
working on building for patients like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing and being part of
a healthcare system that supports medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: By working together, I'm sure we can make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm now going to introduce our next
speaker, Emily Kirkham.
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily is the VP of Laboratory Operations
for Cigoto, a leading provider of quality
[SPEAKER_10]: control consulting to the Canadian medical
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: As co-founder of Cigoto, Emily is the lead
analytical chemistry consultant,
[SPEAKER_10]: a professional chemist at the BSc in
chemistry from McGill University,
[SPEAKER_10]: and she brings over 15 years experience
working in analytical laboratories with an
[SPEAKER_10]: emphasis on quality control procedures and
method development.
So, Emily.
Well,
[SPEAKER_08]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great story to hear from Jonathan
that really, you know, makes me remember
[SPEAKER_08]: why we're all doing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to let us hear for organizing
this event.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been really privileged to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Emily Kirkham, and I'm VP of
Laboratory Operations at Cigno
[SPEAKER_08]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we are consultants in the medical
marijuana field for quality control and
[SPEAKER_08]: analytical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise there's not going to be any
molecular formulas in this presentation,
[SPEAKER_08]: but don't worry, unless you want things
later.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm just going to talk a little bit
about the testing requirements for medical
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana, what's required right now under
the MMPR, and what we might need to,
[SPEAKER_08]: might see in the future coming down the
road.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of you probably are aware there's
requirements right now for testing for
[SPEAKER_08]: potency.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to label all the products for sale
for percentage of THC, percentage of CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people test for potency,
they'll actually look at a lot more
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids, but they're only required to
show the THC or the CBD percentages right
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microbiology, of course, is also required,
and that's a pretty big concern for a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of producers out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The requirements are pretty stringent
under the MMPR, so it's a very important
[SPEAKER_08]: aspect, certainly for patient health and
safety as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heavy metals, that's a unique test.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see that getting tested in a lot
of other jurisdictions and countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also pretty expensive as well,
whether you choose to do it yourself or
[SPEAKER_08]: get it tested at a third-party laboratory.
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the MMPR, the regulations stipulate
that we cannot use any pesticides in the
[SPEAKER_08]: growing process.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, some producers will choose to test for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some others will say, well, we don't use
pesticides, we're not allowed to,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're not going to test for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a precedent that's present in the
pharmaceutical industry as well,
[SPEAKER_08]: so it is valid.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could change in the future,
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be a requirement for pesticide
testing moving forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what are we going to see for added-on
tests in the future?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's, in a lot of jurisdictions
in the states where there are recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: use, there is methodologies that have to
be used for potency testing, whether it's
[SPEAKER_08]: HPLC or GC or a certain pharmacopoeia
method.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of producers are already testing for
terpenes, and as those compounds become
[SPEAKER_08]: linked to more medical effects for
patients, that may become a requirement as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you get into extracts and
other products, that becomes part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: MMPR, and then we're going to need to test
for residual solvents and the edibles and
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrates as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, one thing at Cignoto that we often get
asked about is, what is the difference
[SPEAKER_08]: between testing with a third-party
laboratory versus building your own
[SPEAKER_08]: in-house laboratory?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, both are valid approaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very costly to test outside a
third-party laboratory, depending on how
[SPEAKER_08]: many strains and how much product you're
producing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be spending upwards of $10,000 a
month, so that's an ongoing cost that you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to incur if you're required to do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does divert the liability from
having that testing done in-house.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you build your own lab, though,
you have complete control over what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have access to that testing
facility any time of the life,
[SPEAKER_08]: so you can get up-to-date numbers on
potency and micro, so you have an idea of
[SPEAKER_08]: what's going on in the facility right
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it can be very beneficial to take that
approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, there's also high cost,
upfront cost of buying all this equipment,
[SPEAKER_08]: getting it installed, setting it up,
staffing, training, and method validation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the third-party testing also may be
required in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's not right now, but they may
actually say that a lot of states in the
[SPEAKER_08]: US have stipulated that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there's a lot of different things to
consider.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, a little bit about the science of
testing and what's required.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a table outside, so if you guys
have any questions or want to come and see
[SPEAKER_08]: us, please do come and say hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be great to see you, and I
appreciate the time.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, before we move on to the last speaker,
I want to thank David Williams for giving
[SPEAKER_10]: me his credit card to go shopping.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's not why you gave me your credit
card, or Ryan Williams, if that's not why
[SPEAKER_10]: you gave me your credit card, you should
come get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any neighbors?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, now I'm going to introduce our last
special speaker, Philipe Lucas.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Philipe is the Vice President of
Patient Research and Services at Tilray.
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, he is a PhD student at the
University of Victoria's Social Dimensions
[SPEAKER_10]: of Health Program and a graduate
researcher with the Center of Addictions
[SPEAKER_10]: Research in BC.
[SPEAKER_10]: His scientific research includes
therapeutic use of capsules and cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: and other substances in the treatment of
trauma and addiction, and he has been
[SPEAKER_10]: invited to provide expert testimony before
the Canadian Health of Commons,
the Canadian Senate, and the BC Supreme
Court.
Philipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, and it's great to be
here amongst so many hard-working and
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely gorgeous people who work so
hard to make medical cannabis access
[SPEAKER_05]: possible for critically and chronically
ill Canadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to begin by acknowledging that
I'm currently employed as VP of Patient
[SPEAKER_05]: Research and Services for Tilray,
which is a federally authorized medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis production company located in
Nanaimo, BC.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I was not employed for Tilray
during the planning, data gathering,
[SPEAKER_05]: or analysis of the CAMPS study,
the results of which I'm going to share
[SPEAKER_05]: with you today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to start out with a brief history
of medical cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: This program did not come around because
any of our major parties wanted to do
[SPEAKER_05]: something compassionate for critically and
chronically ill Canadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: It came around because patients stood up
for their rights to gain access to this
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine without fear of arrest and
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_05]: The two main court cases that led to the
establishment of this program were
[SPEAKER_05]: spearheaded by Terry Parker and Jim
Wakeford, an MS patient and a person
[SPEAKER_05]: suffering from HIV-AIDS.
[SPEAKER_05]: In about 1999 and 2000, they were able to
establish a constitutional right to choose
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2001, in response to those court
decisions, Health Canada established the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical marijuana access regulations,
and surveys suggest that about a million
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadians currently claim to be using
cannabis for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_05]: and yet there's only about 50,000 people
in the federal medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_05]: so overwhelmingly, medical cannabis
patients in Canada are not part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: program and therefore not protected from
arrest and prosecution.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been a lot of problems with the
program initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a long and complex application
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lack of uptake on very limited
and poor quality supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the original supply was $5 a
gram, and yet fewer than 10% of patients
[SPEAKER_05]: were accessing that supply under the old
MNAR.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of resistance from
gatekeepers with warnings from the
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian Medical Association and the CMPA,
the insurer against prescribed medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, and the program, as a result of
all this, was found unconstitutional at
[SPEAKER_05]: least 10 times in as many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: After an extended consultation period,
in March 31st, 2014, the MNAR ended and
[SPEAKER_05]: was replaced by the MNPR, which started in
April 1st, 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: This major policy overhaul represents a
significant decentralization of the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal program, and Health Canada now
acts as a regulator rather than its
[SPEAKER_05]: previous role as a provider of medical
cannabis, leaving service delivery largely
[SPEAKER_05]: in the hands of large-scale licensed
producers and privately owned or publicly
[SPEAKER_05]: traded commercial companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: The new MNPR is a significant improvement
over the old MNAR in many ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's now a simplified and decentralized
application process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the old program, it was a 33-page
application.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would take six weeks to six months to
process, and under the new system,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go see your doctor today,
have them fill out a one-page form and
[SPEAKER_05]: walk out of his office as a legal medical
marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_05]: Theoretically, nurse practitioners can
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say theoretically because there isn't a
province yet that has approved nurse
[SPEAKER_05]: practitioners describing, but it is part
of the MNPR that they would be considered
[SPEAKER_05]: as an alternative to just physicians being
able to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, there's multiple licensed
producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than a single producer producing a
single strain, as a result, there's a few
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred strains available to patients,
so strain selection has improved
[SPEAKER_05]: considerably.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's significant quality control,
which was just touched on by Emily.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's mandated lab testing for purity
and for potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also an increased strain symptom
awareness with a lot of licensed producers
[SPEAKER_05]: now teaming with physicians, academic
institutions to provide them and produce
[SPEAKER_05]: research on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there are other changes that have
had a much more negative impact on some
[SPEAKER_05]: patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the loss of personal production
for patients that took place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk a bit about the court case in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, there's a lack of alternatives
for raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no oils, tinctures, salads,
et cetera available, and there's still no
[SPEAKER_05]: storefronts or community-based access
that's federally allowed under the MNPR.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result, there are currently two
significant court challenges in the MNPR.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Allert and the Smith case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, the availability of
alternatives to raw cannabis is something
[SPEAKER_05]: both patients and healthcare providers are
calling for, and it's likely subject to
[SPEAKER_05]: court decisions like the Smith case
recently heard in this pre-court,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as deliberate policy decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: In regards to the right to patients that
produce their own medicine, that's also
[SPEAKER_05]: currently in the hands of the courts with
a decision expected later this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what the outcome, the Allert
case will likely be appealed to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Supreme Court, either the government or
the patients who initiated this court
[SPEAKER_05]: proceeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: As for storefronts, it's really
interesting to note that since the launch
[SPEAKER_05]: of the MNPR, there's been a proliferation
of dispensaries in areas where enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: has not been a community priority,
with Vancouver alone now quite famously
[SPEAKER_05]: going from fewer than 10 community-based
dispensaries three years ago to over 80
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a chance to pass by quite a few of
them today on the way to town.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly a case of landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite these ongoing challenges of the
federal program, the MNPR presents a
[SPEAKER_05]: tightly regulated system that's complex,
it's novel, and it's unlike anything else
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, like the MNPR that preceded
it, the MNPR will likely evolve over time
[SPEAKER_05]: in response to court challenges and
feedback by key stakeholders, and as such,
[SPEAKER_05]: this should really be viewed as a starting
point rather than a final policy on
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis access in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, there are approximately 20
companies licensed to produce and
[SPEAKER_05]: distribute cannabis in Canada,
and a handful more with personal licenses
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing them to produce but not yet
distribute.
[SPEAKER_05]: These privately owned or publicly traded
company act as both the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: company in developing the drug product and
as a pharmacy distributing it directly to
[SPEAKER_05]: patients, which is kind of an unusual
relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to take you on a brief tour of my
office,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'd like to give you a little bit of a
tour of my office, and I'd like to give
[SPEAKER_05]: you a little bit of a tour of my office,
and I'd like to give you a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: tour of my office, and I'd like to give
picture of our first member.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's our first patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Maria.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a former RCMP officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: She uses cannabis in the treatment of both
chronic pain and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: She says it changed her life because a lot
of her to give up all the prescription
[SPEAKER_05]: opiates that we're really having to get an
impact on her.
[SPEAKER_05]: The NNPR authorizes us to form and other
LPs to perform all of the following
[SPEAKER_05]: activities so we can basically produce
from seed all the way up to shipment and
[SPEAKER_05]: we can also perform some testing and some
R&D as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in summary, we've got a 65,000 square
foot facility with about 3-4,000 square
[SPEAKER_05]: feet of production space.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been an investment of over $25
million.
[SPEAKER_05]: We currently have an employee,
178,000 full-time employees with a
[SPEAKER_05]: four-figure employer in Nanaimo and we've
contributed significantly to local tax
[SPEAKER_05]: base and in fact we just won that
investing business of the year award by
[SPEAKER_05]: the Chamber of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unsurprisingly... It's that time,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, Telluride currently has over
50 strains of cannabis available for
[SPEAKER_05]: national and international research
including a number of high CBE strains and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're teaming with Canadian international
researchers to supply or initiate clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: trials, examine patient patterns of use,
strain symptom correlations and the impact
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis of different chemical
compositions on a number of chronic
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Telluride has partnered with
the University of British Columbia to
[SPEAKER_05]: conduct a phase two clinical trial
examining the therapeutic potential of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in the treatment of PTSD that
will focus on military and police veterans
[SPEAKER_05]: and victims of violent sexual assault.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the biggest clinical trial on medical
cannabis that's taken place in Canada over
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very excited to get it started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, we currently have studies on
the use of high CBD cannabis oil in the
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment of pediatric and adult epilepsy
under development in Ontario, New York
[SPEAKER_05]: State.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've just been shortlisted for a
pediatric epilepsy study in Sydney,
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have other research projects focused on
cancer pain, HIV AIDS and patient patterns
[SPEAKER_05]: of use and they're all in preliminary
stages of cooperation with a number of
[SPEAKER_05]: academic institutions and research
organizations.
[SPEAKER_05]: While the results from these studies are
still to come, I'd like to present some
[SPEAKER_05]: historical data from the Canadian patient
population stemming from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_05]: Access for Medical Purposes Survey,
otherwise known as CAMPS.
[SPEAKER_05]: CAMPS is the largest pooling of medical
cannabis patients to date.
[SPEAKER_05]: The principal investigator of the study is
Dr. Zach Walsh and his research was
[SPEAKER_05]: reviewed and approved by the Behavioral
Research Ethics Board of the University of
[SPEAKER_05]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: CAMPS is a 414 question cross-sectional
survey that was available online in
[SPEAKER_05]: writing and in person in 2011 and 2009.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2012 and so it predates the
implementation of the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of this data is pre-MMPR and you'll
see that in some of the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: The study gathered detailed information on
demographics, medical conditions and
[SPEAKER_05]: symptoms and patterns of cannabis use from
628 self-identified Canadian medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people are listening to
this survey.
[SPEAKER_05]: In regards to demographics, comparisons to
the sample to values drawn from the
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian 2006 census population indicated
that males, whites and aboriginals
[SPEAKER_05]: participants were over-represented in the
survey population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical cannabis patients were also
younger, had a higher income, were more
[SPEAKER_05]: likely to have completed high school than
the average Canadian and much,
[SPEAKER_05]: much better looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, lots of what I'm making up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does all fall on the face a little
bit about some of the stereotypes around
[SPEAKER_05]: who uses medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see these populations generally
higher educated, generally higher income,
[SPEAKER_05]: than the Canadian population.
[SPEAKER_05]: The history of non-therapeutic cannabis
use prior to therapeutic use was reported
[SPEAKER_05]: by 82% of participants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mean age for first use was 17,
which is actually higher than the Canadian
[SPEAKER_05]: average of 15 or 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first therapeutic use was 28 years
old on average.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that medical cannabis
patients clearly differentiate between the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational use patterns and the medical
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most participants who reported higher use
reported increased use with the initiation
[SPEAKER_05]: of therapeutic use.
[SPEAKER_05]: 33% reported a large increase,
32% a small increase, 7% reported a large
[SPEAKER_05]: decrease and 10% a small decrease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aggregate analysis indicated that 40% of
participants reported using more than 14
[SPEAKER_05]: grams per week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of those reported higher use,
the median weekly amount was 20%.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of frequency of use, 42% of
participants used cannabis two to three
[SPEAKER_05]: times per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: When asked what the preferred method of
use was 45% preferred smoking,
[SPEAKER_05]: 33% preferred vaporization and 21%
preferred to eat or ingest cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: infused products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis also presented an opportunity to
examine how legitimate access to cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: might affect the use of other illicit and
illicit psychoactive substances,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is an area that I've been
researching for a number of years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This concept, which is known as cannabis
substitution in fact, reflects the
[SPEAKER_05]: conscious and unconscious use of cannabis
as an alternative to pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_05]: to alcohol use and to illicit substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as such it has significant public
health implications.
[SPEAKER_05]: The camp study found that 87% of patients
reported substituting cannabis for one or
[SPEAKER_05]: more alcohol, illicit drugs or
prescription drugs with 36% reporting
[SPEAKER_05]: substitution for a single class of
substance 25% substituting for two and 26%
[SPEAKER_05]: substituting for all three of these
substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: Examination by class of drug identified
substitution for prescription drugs as the
[SPEAKER_05]: most common at 80% followed by 52% and
finally illicit substances with 32%
[SPEAKER_05]: substitution.
[SPEAKER_05]: As in previous studies, the most commonly
endorsed reasons for substitution were
[SPEAKER_05]: less adverse side effects and better
symptom management.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a novel finding was that younger
participants were more likely to report
[SPEAKER_05]: substitution than older patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this may be simply because older
patients are more fixed in their substance
[SPEAKER_05]: use patterns or perhaps because younger
patients simply use greater variety of
[SPEAKER_05]: substances in the first place and
therefore more likely to use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_05]: substitute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, the substance use finding
suggested that medical and potentially
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational cannabis use can reduce the
use and the public health and safety
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts associated with prescription
drugs, alcohol and the harmful use of some
[SPEAKER_05]: illicit substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And taken together, the camp study helps
us better understand the Canadian medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis patient population and their
patterns of use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, our findings provide further
evidence for the widespread nature of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis substitution and suggest
potentially fruitful avenues for research
[SPEAKER_05]: that elucidates the complex relationships
between cannabis use and the use of other
[SPEAKER_05]: substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: In closing, I'd really like to thank Dr.
Zach Walz, the principal investigator of
[SPEAKER_05]: CAMPS.
[SPEAKER_05]: My co-researchers came prior to me,
Robert Calloway, Linda Lale, Susan
[SPEAKER_05]: Holtzman, Leigh Alcalde, who's here today,
and Bob K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, my gratitude to the Center for
Relations Research of British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_05]: the University of Victoria, Bertil Ray for
ongoing support in our research,
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lift to MJ for this opportunity to
present here today to all of you for your
[SPEAKER_05]: time and interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to introduce you all at once,
but you can all come up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to shift gears now and move
to our panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to start by introducing our
moderator, Hilary Lack.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hilary was the founder of the BC
Compassion Self Society, the first medical
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis dispensary in Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: This dispensary has been serving patients
for over 18 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: She currently serves as the Director of
Patient and Community Services with Bedro
[SPEAKER_10]: Pan Canada, which is one of Home Canada's
federally licensed producers under the
[SPEAKER_10]: MNPR.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she'll be moderating, so this is the
last you'll have to see of me for about an
[SPEAKER_10]: hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, I'm going to introduce our
panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So first, we have Brent Settle,
who is the President and CEO of Cannymed.
[SPEAKER_10]: He co-founded Cary Plant Systems in 1988.
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2000, he became the first only supplier
of medical marijuana to the Canadian
[SPEAKER_10]: government.
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the MNPR, Cary Plant Systems
supplies medical marijuana through its
[SPEAKER_10]: subsidiary, Cannymed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, I'll introduce Mark Hayden.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mark is an adjunct professor at the
School of Population and Public Health at
[SPEAKER_10]: UBC.
[SPEAKER_10]: He has been published on the issue of drug
policy in the Canadian Journal of Public
[SPEAKER_10]: Health and the International Journal of
Drug Policy.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was involved in producing the Health
Officers Council paper on the regulation
[SPEAKER_10]: of illegal drugs in 2005.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would make sense to write these in
order, but that's not what we did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, I'll introduce Deidre McPherson.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Deidre is currently serving as the
Executive Director at one of Canada's
[SPEAKER_10]: oldest medical cannabis dispensaries,
the Victoria Cannabis Fires Club.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well, he serves as an advisor to the
Canadian Association of Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: Dispensaries and is the co-founder of
Cannymed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe they have a booth outside
today as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And last, but not least, I do just have to
say that, but you can't just say last.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Jonathan Page.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's an adjunct professor at the Botany
Department of UBC.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is a scientist in October focused on
understanding the biochemical and genetic
[SPEAKER_10]: secrets of medicinal plants, including
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: He pursues this research through an
academic program at UBC and an MDLF.
So thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I don't pick up the mic and just leave
it there, can you all hear me well?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's lovely to see you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some new faces and some familiar
faces.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, we're going to try to cover quite
a broad range of topics.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could dive into each one of these
subjects for hours of time, but we have
[SPEAKER_11]: worked hard to identify the relevant and
current issues that need to be dug into.
[SPEAKER_11]: And solutions that we need to come to some
solutions around some of the issues we're
[SPEAKER_11]: facing.
[SPEAKER_11]: A really complex medical cannabis
landscape right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this conversation, one can look through
it through many lenses.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a political agenda.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a business agenda.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a lens of activism.
[SPEAKER_11]: And most importantly, to be in a lens of
patient needs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we'll probably hear a variety
of those perspectives.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a tremendous amount of expertise
in this panel and also in this room,
[SPEAKER_11]: a wide variety of expertise.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the kind folks that left gave me
permission to set up a structure for this
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a debate.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are not looking to come out of this
room with winners or losers.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are here to draw on the expertise
that's in this room to try to move towards
[SPEAKER_11]: creating some consensus and some solutions
together.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not going to happen in an hour long
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's an important shift in the
mood of what's happening in the medical
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis landscape right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we're asking these questions to the
panel, I would also ask you to make note
[SPEAKER_11]: to yourself your answer to these
questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you have an idea or a thought that
we haven't talked about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there something you really agree with
or something that you strongly disagree
[SPEAKER_11]: with?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're going to have hopefully
about half an hour to hear from you and to
[SPEAKER_11]: engage you in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really hoping that we can create a
very meaningful conversation here because
[SPEAKER_11]: we are the opinion leaders and the pulse
of medical cannabis on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are a lot of patients looking
for us to create a really good solution to
[SPEAKER_11]: not waste our energy and our time
debating.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not in the parliament.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to cover three main broad
topics.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a fourth one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a couple of bonus questions if we have
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see if we get there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way that we're going to set this
up is we're going to try to do each
[SPEAKER_11]: question in about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be really hard because the
complex questions are really big issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can do a little bit more meetings as
we can do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I won't turn around.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I turn around and face you guys,
you can't hear me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to try to answer each
question in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first respondent, try to keep it to
around two minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really have more to say,
you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I'd like to do is have two
minutes for the first respondent and then
[SPEAKER_11]: one or two call one minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we can have some flexibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: So does that sound good?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first topic that we're going to get
into is quality control and testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of our previous presenters have
touched on a couple of these subjects.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there might be a few things that get
repeated.
[SPEAKER_11]: But rather than pulling the questions,
we're going to just dig deeply into them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first thing that I think would be
interesting for us to talk about is we've
[SPEAKER_11]: talked, we're talking a lot about quality
control and testing measures is what are
[SPEAKER_11]: the potential but specific harms that are
possible in herbal cannabis, particularly
[SPEAKER_11]: inhaled herbal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know I said you only had two minutes,
but I was hoping that you could touch on
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticides and fungicides, molds,
heavy metals and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_11]: So first, let's talk about what the real
potential harms are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're going to talk about what
the measures are that are in place to
[SPEAKER_11]: address them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so in terms of harms, I've done some
digging in the scientific literature about
[SPEAKER_19]: the types of harms and things that have
happened to people who have consumed
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis, whether it's medically or
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's actually not a lot of
information about harms that have been
[SPEAKER_19]: done or documented.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as Hillary alluded to, there's this
sort of microbiological harms,
[SPEAKER_19]: things like bacteria and fungi that can be
growing on the surface of the vibe or on
[SPEAKER_19]: the material.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they themselves are viable.
[SPEAKER_19]: They could infect people, for example.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in some cases, there's at least two
published cases of aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_19]: so this would be a fungus, infecting
immune compromised patients who consume
[SPEAKER_19]: marijuana that has fungi.
[SPEAKER_19]: So aspergillus will live in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_19]: The fungus will spread in one of these
published cases.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a medical case report, the person
died, and in another case, they were cured
[SPEAKER_19]: by antifungal therapy.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's one example of documented harms.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, we know that you don't want
bacteria and mold on your salad greens,
[SPEAKER_19]: and you wouldn't want it on medicine
either.
[SPEAKER_19]: But still, there's not that much evidence
that contaminated cannabis with microbes
[SPEAKER_19]: growing on it has far more killed people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Another area that Hillary mentioned is
pesticides and fungicides.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, in NNPR, these are being tested
for.
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, they're not allowed in the NNPR
system, but there's still the possibility
[SPEAKER_19]: in cannabis sourced through other means,
for example, dispensaries that would have
[SPEAKER_19]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's things like spider mites that
are very common in the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_19]: garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some people think that if you smoke a
joint and it has pesticides, the
[SPEAKER_19]: pesticides are inactivated by the burning
or the heating or vaporization.
[SPEAKER_19]: But there is published research that shows
that's not the case, that pesticides can
[SPEAKER_19]: inhale.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is evidence that things can be
harmful, but again, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_19]: evidence or a lot of documented evidence
of people getting really sick from
[SPEAKER_19]: marijuana or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Daniel, what other panelists want to speak
to potential harms of contaminants?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think there's anything that was
missed in John Dancer?
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an incident in the nursing home
where they had 12 patrons that were using
[SPEAKER_14]: material.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of the 12 in the nursing home,
two had to be medicated for onset of mold
[SPEAKER_14]: and pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is a risk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though it's not well documented,
there is a risk.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like any other biological thing,
there's risks.
[SPEAKER_14]: And under the MMR, 57% of the patients
that were using the product under the MMR
[SPEAKER_14]: were also using immunosuppressants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So their immune systems, be it because
they had the conditions of HIV AIDS or
[SPEAKER_14]: they had cancer, that's because of their
immunosuppress.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're also a little higher risk in terms
of vulnerability when it comes to other
[SPEAKER_14]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where the harm reduction and
potential has to be realized in order to
[SPEAKER_14]: make cannabis as safe as we can,
particularly for this population who are
[SPEAKER_14]: being compromised.
Exactly.
Excellent, thank you.
Dieter, do you want to speak to harms or
can you move on to the next question?
[SPEAKER_18]: There seems to be a certain class of
patients where they are far more affected
[SPEAKER_18]: by any sort of microtoxins or other
funguses or molds.
[SPEAKER_18]: But generally speaking, it's not as
widespread as it once was believed.
[SPEAKER_18]: There was some research that came out of
Holland of the coffee shops that showed
[SPEAKER_18]: that there were things like fuccaliform on
the cannabis, but that actually exists on
[SPEAKER_18]: surprisingly almost everything we interact
with on a day-to-day basis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this becomes more of an issue when
we move on to derivative products like
[SPEAKER_18]: edibles with long shelf lives and lots of
carbohydrates and things to feed them.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're going to touch on that a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important for those that know
they're very immune compromised to be
[SPEAKER_18]: aware of what they're consuming and
there's no two ways about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So those risks are real in certain cases,
but maybe not as prevalent as we once
[SPEAKER_18]: thought.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Dieter.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've talked about what are the harms,
what are the risks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're going to talk about what is
currently in place to prevent those harms.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's first talk about the quality
control measures that are in place for the
[SPEAKER_11]: MMPR.
[SPEAKER_11]: We heard a little bit about it from our
lovely presenter, Amy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe you can tell us a little bit
more about the quality control measures
[SPEAKER_11]: that are in place in the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, right now, after having several
inspections from Canada under the new
[SPEAKER_14]: regulation, they've only now beginning to
think about quality control.
[SPEAKER_14]: But before up to this point, they were all
focused on Division 3, which is all about
[SPEAKER_14]: the security.
[SPEAKER_14]: Under the old program, the MMPR,
we were governed on what's called GMP,
[SPEAKER_14]: Good Manufacturing Practices, which we had
to establish a set of standard operating
[SPEAKER_14]: procedures for testing protocols.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's one of the reasons we have now
we say we have 281 points of quality
[SPEAKER_14]: control because every step has to be
measured.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, and we follow a certain British
pharmacophobia.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Health Canada came and they lamented
to us about three weeks ago that there is
[SPEAKER_14]: no standard, the pharmacopias,
there's no standard in the industry right
[SPEAKER_14]: now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all over the map in terms of testing
and the quality control aspects.
So they're just now, I would say,
starting to think about what parts quality
control is, they're thinking about what's
important, but they haven't really arrived
at anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just sort of, the whole ambition
of the Russian program together was really
[SPEAKER_14]: to get some defined access for patients
across the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they're only starting to ask
themselves a question.
[SPEAKER_14]: What does a quality control mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: We've inherited a program before that we
just simply transposed over, added some
[SPEAKER_14]: other varieties to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's really, it's focusing on
those aspects that where you touch on all
[SPEAKER_14]: those points we just alluded to in the
previous question to make sure they're
[SPEAKER_14]: covered in a manner that is as safe as can
be.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had toxicologists that had chirped in
on the kind of levels of medical,
[SPEAKER_14]: levels of controls.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they gave a very low bar because as
John says, there's not very much wealth
[SPEAKER_14]: document.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to fall within that low bar and
it's surprisingly, they borrowed a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: the language from the natural health
products record in order to establish some
[SPEAKER_14]: of that baseline stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's gonna be something in the
future that as this program evolves and as
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a need and there's other recalls
that happen, they're compelled to make it
[SPEAKER_14]: as safe as they can.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can see that there's gonna be changes
on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter, will you speak to what quality
control measures are in place for
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like with anything in the dispensary
world, there's no single answer.
[SPEAKER_18]: It varies from dispensary to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can't speak with certainty to what
everyone does, but I can certainly speak
[SPEAKER_18]: to best practices that have been adopted
by some of the older dispensaries and some
[SPEAKER_18]: of the newer alike.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we likewise use GPV and SOV.
[SPEAKER_18]: So our good production practices are in
large part how we guarantee that the
[SPEAKER_18]: product that we're selling is safe for our
membership.
[SPEAKER_18]: So although we don't have the same access
to academics and equipment that licensed
[SPEAKER_18]: producers have, by having people have with
us a set list of things they can and can't
[SPEAKER_18]: do, products they can use and can't use,
and a thorough inspection, it goes a long
[SPEAKER_18]: way.
[SPEAKER_18]: When it comes to things like mold and
mildew, a single point of testing or two
[SPEAKER_18]: points of testing in a large batch,
generally speaking, isn't representational
[SPEAKER_18]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody that's used cannabis before or
worked with cannabis will realize that you
[SPEAKER_18]: can pull one good bud and one bad bud of
any batch.
[SPEAKER_18]: So trained employees that hand inspect
every good product is very important.
[SPEAKER_18]: Knowing and having good equipment to spot
that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_18]: But when it comes to things like
adulterants, like pesticides, where
[SPEAKER_18]: there's some level of trust, and of course
audits on our producers that they are
[SPEAKER_18]: following the rules that we've set for
them, we're not able to do that testing
[SPEAKER_18]: very easily.
[SPEAKER_18]: When it comes to derivative products,
it's actually pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_18]: Most common sense is just you use food and
drug standards that exist in every other
[SPEAKER_18]: industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: We tend to not treat it so much like a
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a food product for the most part.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, most of it is based on 20 years
of experience in the industry and common
[SPEAKER_18]: sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this has been more of a subjective
question.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about how stringent does the testing
need to be specifically for
[SPEAKER_11]: herbal-initiated cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's leave the extracts and the
edibles out of it for now because it's a
[SPEAKER_11]: whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how stringent do we think that the
quality control measures should be?
[SPEAKER_11]: And do we think that the measures that are
currently in place under the MMPR are
[SPEAKER_11]: appropriate?
[SPEAKER_11]: Should they be stricter?
[SPEAKER_11]: Should they be more lax?
[SPEAKER_19]: I can try to address that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it's a very unique product in the
sense that how many other herbal medicines
[SPEAKER_19]: are actually vaporized or smoked where
you're getting, for example, if there is
[SPEAKER_19]: contamination in heavy metals like cadmium
or red, it's rapidly taken up into the
[SPEAKER_19]: bloodstreams by the lungs.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I think we have to have a pretty
high bar here when we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis just because of the mode of
consumption compared to, yes, tobacco will
[SPEAKER_19]: be another parallel.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in terms of other pharmaceutical
products, there's not that much to compare
[SPEAKER_19]: it to.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess the high bar is there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Health Canada, I think, struggled with
where to set those tolerances and limits
[SPEAKER_19]: and went to things like natural health
product regulations and said, what's
[SPEAKER_19]: present in other herbal medicines?
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, if you're taking a kinase or
something in a commercial sense,
[SPEAKER_19]: it would be tested for various things.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think there was an attempt to adapt
some of the international and national
[SPEAKER_19]: standards from other products that would
be comparable.
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, with something like pesticides,
at some point, pesticides might be allowed
[SPEAKER_19]: in commercial and marijuana production.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yet, what do we know about pesticides
being inhaled by people's computer
[SPEAKER_19]: vaporizing?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess the main thing is that we want
fairly stringent controls.
[SPEAKER_19]: But deciding what those numbers are in
microphones or another level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to comment?
Mark, we're getting into some good
questions for you.
Thank you for your patience.
You won't feel bad for him in a few
minutes.
Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that, again, without something
like a broker, they're just inventing a
[SPEAKER_14]: wheel of knowledge in terms of what the
standards should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to say that Health Canada,
for the most part, has ignored the entire
[SPEAKER_14]: MMA art.
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't learned any lessons from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now, we're really trying to,
again, establish what those bars should
[SPEAKER_14]: be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really, again, common sense.
The big thing is that what they're trying
to establish is a system of
accountability.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's an accountability chain so that
people who are relying on us as medicine
[SPEAKER_14]: is on the label.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on the label is important.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the label.
[SPEAKER_14]: The concentrations are there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the product is within the category of
what they think is being said.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though they haven't really
established what that bar looks like,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're just coming to that now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really about coming along with
that system of accountability.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the metal side of it,
again, that's all going to be driven by
[SPEAKER_14]: toxicologists.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it could take years to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing about cannabis is it's the
Ferrari of plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: It grows very fast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which also means that it doesn't prejudice
against metal that it takes up.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, they use the hemp lines around
the Chernobyl to help.
[SPEAKER_14]: So in other words, I think for the most
part, we can see that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_14]: prejudice.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll take whatever's up that's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's really a question,
what is the safe benchmark?
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, we've gone through the British
Pharmacopoeia, which is some established.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can say at this point in time,
based on what I've seen with other
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis, that there isn't anything
established as of yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be probably knee-driven.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen some grand negative bacteria
show up in a few recalls.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think that we're going to see
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: The story isn't finished yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only just begun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
Peter, a question for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: What testing is available for people who
are producing under the MNAR or cell
[SPEAKER_11]: producers who are growing for
dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it possible for admitted labs to work
with dispensaries and MNAR growers?
[SPEAKER_18]: Some labs work with MNAR growers as long
as they have a valid pink slip.
[SPEAKER_18]: There seems to have been a shift recently
where accredited labs have section 9 or
[SPEAKER_18]: section 56 have been advised to no longer
accept from patients under the MNAR.
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe under the MNPR in some cases as
well.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're very limited to the relationships
that we can strike out as a dispensary
[SPEAKER_18]: with accredited labs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they do have to go through a lot
of work to get that clearance to be able
[SPEAKER_18]: to house and hold these products.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a great deal of risk.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some dispensaries like the DCCS have had
relationships with unlicensed labs for
[SPEAKER_18]: quite some time, over a decade.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say who they are, but we've made
some friendly relationships with labs in
[SPEAKER_18]: the past.
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you're working in an illegal
industry, a product that's considered
[SPEAKER_18]: illegal, which we do in the dispenser
world, I think it's very burdensome to
[SPEAKER_18]: deal with transportation and getting into
the labs.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are certainly very limited.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some dispensaries actually have their own
GCs.
[SPEAKER_18]: So gas chromatographs, and we've seen the
price of those units drop quite
[SPEAKER_18]: drastically over the last couple years.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is certainly difficult and
something that we need to improve on over
[SPEAKER_18]: the coming year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brandy talked about the variety of
standards within the different
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmacopoeia, that the US pharmacopoeia
and the European pharmacopoeia have
[SPEAKER_11]: different standards.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we also have different testing
equipment and different methodologies that
[SPEAKER_11]: also result in a variety of results,
even when we're trying to do, say,
[SPEAKER_11]: a basic cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: So from an industry perspective,
I imagine that this could be difficult.
[SPEAKER_11]: What if a licensed producer's methodology
is different than Health Canada's
[SPEAKER_11]: methodology?
[SPEAKER_11]: From a patient perspective, I work with a
mother who produces her own extract from a
[SPEAKER_11]: standardized source for her child with
seizures.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she'll take one batch of her extract,
send it to three different labs,
[SPEAKER_11]: and get three totally different sets of
results.
[SPEAKER_11]: Making it very difficult for her to figure
out her dosage for her child.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a conundrum that she is asking
me, I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think maybe, again, I'm kind of
picking on you guys, but maybe John and
[SPEAKER_11]: Ren could speak to, is it possible to
create one uniform standard testing
[SPEAKER_11]: practice?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the issue is actually mainly the
potency testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: So THC, CBD, we go deeper into the other
cannabinoids that are present.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that this is a product that
no government has really got behind,
[SPEAKER_19]: the government dragged by the courts into
this area.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it's not like they've sort of said,
let's validate a method and publish it and
[SPEAKER_19]: tell all the licensed producers or tell
the dispensaries that this is the way
[SPEAKER_19]: we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they mention HPLC versus GC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And would they mandate HPLC as the go-to
method?
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the method that can give you the
acidic cannabinoids rather than the
[SPEAKER_19]: neutral cannabinoids, the decarboxylation
and all the chemistry behind it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But the government normally are validating
such methods.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in this case, potency analysis is left
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's Colorado, it's Washington,
it's Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really think that at some point,
we're going to have to develop a real
[SPEAKER_19]: standard that we can compare against.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that doesn't mean that in this case,
the industry has to just do this one
[SPEAKER_19]: method to agree where there's going to,
but within certain parameters,
[SPEAKER_19]: for example, I think HPLC should be the
sort of number two analysis company.
[SPEAKER_19]: But so far, we haven't seen how Canada do
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: The published regulations are just,
the method should be validated and it
[SPEAKER_19]: should be accurate.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you should, you know, the most sort of
lowest common denominator of suggestions
[SPEAKER_19]: for annulment capacity are applied.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know, Brent, do you have
anything to add to it?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, are they moving?
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear that they're moving in the
direction of a validated method?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the first attempt on the MMAR of
Canada was they wanted us to measure seven
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they said they only use a GC method,
gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the gas chromatograph only really
touches on THC and maybe CBN.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they wanted us to do seven,
CBD, CBA, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we said, well, what are you using your
method for?
[SPEAKER_14]: They had seven labs as drug analytical
services.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's only for drug convictions.
[SPEAKER_14]: So their only reason for having it was so
that they had to get about 0.3% THC to get
[SPEAKER_14]: a conviction.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they didn't care what it was after
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you're measuring for potency and
accuracy, you got to have a much more
[SPEAKER_14]: robust system.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we first were, in 2003,
when we were invited to then start
[SPEAKER_14]: producing based on the Ontario Supreme
Court, it's a case thrust into the not to
[SPEAKER_14]: our ambitions, but to what health Canada
dictated.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at that time, then we said,
well, we have to come up with a validated
[SPEAKER_14]: method.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had to actually engage another lab
and spend an enormous amount of time
[SPEAKER_14]: developing a validated method that
followed our focus.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it took three years to get to a
standard.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the results were reliable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the challenge was, we sent it out to
other labs and to the experiences that we
[SPEAKER_14]: had.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every lab came back with a different
potency and a different range of THCs and
[SPEAKER_14]: CBDs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the disturbing part.
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't get any standardization.
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the problem is that the system
didn't take into consideration these high
[SPEAKER_14]: peaks of which THC can be with these
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_14]: We weren't used to that kind of
concentration.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those machines, like the high pressure
chromatography, HPLCs, are used to making
[SPEAKER_14]: very small ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: But having something like 22% or 28%,
the machines go crazy because they're not
[SPEAKER_14]: used to those kind of volumes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to develop a method so they can
get an accuracy that was reliable every
[SPEAKER_14]: single time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not only on the machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also having a very tight amount of
sampling and how you prepare it that
[SPEAKER_14]: becomes critical.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because every step in the process,
you change it one little bit and it has a
[SPEAKER_14]: direct impact.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the method had to be standardized.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer to the question is,
is there going to be a standardization?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think patients, and so I'll
bring it back to patients, they need to
[SPEAKER_14]: know what's in their medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they've become reliant on it from
a memory point of view.
[SPEAKER_14]: When they go to use it and they dose it,
and they're taking it from a dosing
[SPEAKER_14]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it has to be, what's on the model
should be something that they can remember
[SPEAKER_14]: to use every single time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the only way they really do that is if
they can actually put that accurate and
[SPEAKER_14]: precise learning.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I think we'll go to the exact
validation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if we're waiting for Health
Canada to take leadership on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If maybe it's something that the industry
and the community is going to have to do
[SPEAKER_11]: together to establish that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the moderator.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not supposed to be commenting.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think so far?
Interesting questions?
Is this like the kind of stuff that you're
interested in?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have another really
simple, uncomplex question next.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I promise we're getting into the
regulations now soon again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how much do we know about the
correlation of cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: profiles to symptom management?
[SPEAKER_11]: And now that patients do have access to
cannabinoid profiles, how does that change
[SPEAKER_11]: the efficacy of the way that they're
choosing their strains rather than the
[SPEAKER_11]: adipocetiva classification that we have
been working on historically?
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're learning, we're obviously
learning that cannabis consists of more
[SPEAKER_19]: than just THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: So THC was the most bioactive molecule.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the psychoactive ingredient for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_19]: CBD has reappeared on the scene in the
last three or four years as an important
[SPEAKER_19]: component, especially with things like
childhood epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think it's clear from patient
feedback, not necessarily published
[SPEAKER_19]: scientific literature, that strains have
different properties and different
[SPEAKER_19]: effects.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's that anecdotal evidence that you
could have a 17% THC in a heavy indica
[SPEAKER_19]: versus 17% in a sativa type strain.
[SPEAKER_19]: And whether I believe there's a real
genetic difference between sativa and
[SPEAKER_19]: indica doesn't really matter, but that
those strains smoked by or vaporized by
[SPEAKER_19]: one patient can have radical effects.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's other things in cannabis and
it's been termed the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_19]: where the THC is sort of the main player
and the entourage are these other
[SPEAKER_19]: components like terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are minor cannabinoids that we don't
normally talk about, but I was mentioning
[SPEAKER_19]: like CECA and CBC, not the television
channel obviously.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we still don't know what they
contribute.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're the smell of cannabis,
in the case of terpenoids, but they're
[SPEAKER_19]: also part of the high, part of the
therapeutic properties, maybe part of the
[SPEAKER_19]: sedative properties of indica type,
what people would call indica type,
[SPEAKER_19]: but they're also part of the high,
part of the therapeutic properties of
indica type.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're really just starting to get a
handle on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things I said in talks I've
given in the past is that there's this
[SPEAKER_19]: really difficult science gap between
cannabis being prohibition since 1937 in
[SPEAKER_19]: the US, the fact that universities and
government labs were really prevented from
[SPEAKER_19]: doing research on it, it's still very
difficult to get research licenses.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's these outstanding questions
about things like the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_19]: and it's really LPs, dispensaries,
other people involved in it, and patient
[SPEAKER_19]: advocacy groups that are going to be doing
the research that can start to answer some
[SPEAKER_19]: of those questions.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
Do you have something burning to say?
You're okay?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say that the NAVCET term probably
needs to go out the window, or at least it
[SPEAKER_18]: shouldn't be the primary point for
patients to interact with the plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: I also think that the entourage effect is
just a theory at this point, and we have
[SPEAKER_18]: these license producers with wonderful
analytical capabilities that can look into
[SPEAKER_18]: the specifics of these plants,
and there should be some, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: it should be fairly easy to do this
research to figure out what each one of
[SPEAKER_18]: these sub-components is doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can actually say with certainty,
based on that cannabinoid profile and that
[SPEAKER_18]: terpene profile, that this type of patient
will get this effect.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now it's all based on smell.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a patient smells it and they go,
I know how that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just going to say that, you know,
I don't think imican sativa are dead
[SPEAKER_19]: necessarily as concepts.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're a good classification,
but they're, you know, it's a useful
[SPEAKER_19]: classification by these sort of,
you know, stimulating versus sedative
[SPEAKER_19]: strains, but it's being applied so
inaccurately that it's very difficult for
[SPEAKER_19]: patients to sort of use it and trust it or
dispensary or LPs.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's still, there is this sort of
bifurcation in the usage of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_19]: strains that we need to get a handle on.
[SPEAKER_19]: And just tidying up a lot so we can use
for people.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm considering, especially as I've
seen, the male are very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well, that was a lot of material that
we just tried to cover in a short amount
[SPEAKER_11]: of time around testing and constituents.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw we lost some of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little bit dry for some of you,
and some of the rest of you are like
[SPEAKER_11]: glued.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what you want to learn
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now we're going to move on to talking
about the regulation of distribution.
[SPEAKER_11]: And currently in Canada, there are at
least, there are more than three,
[SPEAKER_11]: but there are three main systems by which
patients are accessing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So some patients are still accessing
cannabis through the MMAR growers that are
[SPEAKER_11]: still functioning under the Allard
Injunction.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some patients are accessing medical
cannabis through dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_11]: and some through the MMPR and the
federally licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a whole ball of wax.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try and tease it apart a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can these three systems coexist in Canada,
or should there be one uniform system of
[SPEAKER_11]: distribution and access for patients
across the country?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll break these apart.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, I'm going to throw way too much
on the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first question is, can these three
systems coexist, or should there be one
[SPEAKER_11]: uniform system across the country?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Aden is our drug regulatory guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't have his feet deep in the
medical cannabis world, so it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_11]: safer question for him to first launch
into.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in a very odd position here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been standing in front of audiences
for 30 years talking about drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And mostly, I've been really annoying
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking about the failures of
drug prohibition for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not particularly interested in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm interested in all currently illegal
drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drug prohibition doesn't work,
and we need to do something differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been pissing off a lot of people
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I find myself in a very odd
position of working with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: community and annoying them, talking about
the need to regulate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my position is, where I sit,
is I teach at the UBC School of Population
[SPEAKER_06]: and Public Health, and I write papers with
the medical health officer counsel.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who are responsible for public
health in the province of British
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we kind of choose a drug, and we
explore what would regulatory model for
[SPEAKER_06]: this drug look like based on public health
principles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just looking, where does public health
sit?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I look at the left-hand side of this
graph, what I see is prohibition does
[SPEAKER_06]: significant harms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what prohibition does is give
drugs to organized crime, and bullets are
[SPEAKER_06]: a public health problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And high schools become primary
distribution points of drugs in our
[SPEAKER_06]: society.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't create safe communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's another end to this continuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other end is commercialization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one lesson we can learn from
alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you give it to large companies who have
the goal of increasing consumption,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are making a huge social mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So public health sits in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really the question is, how do we
regulate and control all currently illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: drugs based on public health principles in
order to minimize the harm to all of our
[SPEAKER_06]: society?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of the fundamental question
that drives my interest in this session.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to say I'm the chair of
the Board of M.A.S.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada, which is the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies.
I have to say this is how you take on
regulation of psychedelics.
My previous paper was the regulation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how would we do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they're all different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So had the regulation of psychedelics been
different from cannabis, it would be
[SPEAKER_06]: different from heroin and cocaine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's just play with the cannabis idea
for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the model that we have proposed is that
there is a large provincial organization
[SPEAKER_06]: called a commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: A commission is arms length from
government to government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Governments will always try and maximize
whatever they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will not be neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: Governments are not neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want an organization that is able
to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a commission would be a provincial
commission would oversee all currently
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have different branches.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a cannabis branch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cannabis branch would be
responsible for the structure and sales of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might vary across Canada,
which is one of your questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But probably not that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: The model that we are proposing is that
any adult over the age of 19 would be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to walk in and purchase cannabis at a
discreet looking store.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wouldn't have storefront
advertising.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be discreet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be able to see products
through the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Youth would also be able to access it with
adult's permission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the model we have for that is the
United States has alcohol to amounts,
[SPEAKER_06]: number six, seven, eight states,
don't quote me on the number, have legal
[SPEAKER_06]: access to underage minors for alcohol
based on parental approval.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we thought about this long and hard
for our psychedelics paper and decided
[SPEAKER_06]: that actually Aboriginal communities being
used in psychedelics for centuries and
[SPEAKER_06]: have always included youth in a ceremonial
and structural way that allowed them to
[SPEAKER_06]: celebrate rites of passage and encourage
maturity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was with parental approval and
support.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would like to see the same happening
with cannabis generally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So parental permission would allow youth
to access it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you would access would be known
quantities or known qualities.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the stuff that we're talking about
today is relevant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So known concentrations, known strains,
known CBD profiles, known, yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole knowledge that's being discussed
as cannabis will be available to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'd be non-branded.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one lesson to be learned from
alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: One lesson is if you allow a product to be
branded, it will be advertised.
[SPEAKER_06]: And advertising has a goal and the goal is
to increase consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal of this new law was not to
increase consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to allow access without promoting the
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my other sticks that I do is that
there's no such thing as a good drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as a bad drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any drug can be used and any drug can be
abused.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any drug is available for abuse and any
drug is available for use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you manage that to allow people
to access it without promoting it by large
[SPEAKER_06]: multinational corporations?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really the question public health
asks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So price.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a lot of squat.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much would you charge for this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not a simple question because
it's too high that black market flourishes
[SPEAKER_06]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Black market is the wrong term to use in
the multiracial multi-ethnic community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The illegal market would flourish.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the price was too high, if the price
was too low, you're increasing
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially you need to have a fluid
price based on the size of the illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to monitor the size of the
legal market and adjust your price
[SPEAKER_06]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be some volume restrictions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly the Netherlands has one of the
models that I've looked at long and hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a 10 gram per day limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's completely reasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I would allow these facilities
to be set up to sell other drugs as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cannabis is just one, but we need
to move off that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was an overarching goal,
the look and the model, the goal is to
[SPEAKER_06]: make it look boring.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I think about why the Netherlands has
50% of the youth per capita consuming
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, versus the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have very thoughtfully and quite
frankly brilliantly allowed cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_06]: sold to adults in a model that doesn't
encourage the consumption so people can
[SPEAKER_06]: access it, but it doesn't encourage it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So half the Dutch youth use cannabis in
the United States because they have this
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding of how to restructure the
process to quite frankly make it look
[SPEAKER_06]: boring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where will people be allowed to consume
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in cannabis, consumption facilities
would be available.
[SPEAKER_06]: People could purchase it and take it home,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be allowed to walk down the
street smoking a joint?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't walk down the street smoking and
drinking a beer right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably similar to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But would there be outdoor recreation
facilities allowed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like parks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, probably yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Concerts?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be very hard to restrict it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having some thoughtful thinking about
where people are allowed to consume it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly over the years, we are moving
towards a public health approach to the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly one of the things that
they've done quite thoughtfully around the
[SPEAKER_06]: world is to reduce where it's consumed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a very thoughtful approach to
that would be needed in any public health
[SPEAKER_06]: model.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wouldn't be consumed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be consumed in thoughtful
locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the interesting questions that I
have is who grows it?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a public health principle here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The public health principle is based on a
book named The Spirit Level, by a fellow
[SPEAKER_06]: named Wilkinson.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a fascinating read.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's public health being beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Statistics being beautiful for the lay
public.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he asked a very simple question.
[SPEAKER_06]: What causes all the social problems that
we have out there in our society?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everything from low birth weight
babies to murders to addiction rates to
[SPEAKER_06]: all kinds of social problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he said is the biggest problem is
in the egalitarianism.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the difference between the rich and
the poor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So societies that have a mass of
difference between rich and poor people
[SPEAKER_06]: have huge problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal would be to spread the money
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not having big growers would be the
intention to having lots of small growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't concentrate money as a public
health principle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's having money spread out and not
having large growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's based on solid public health
principles.
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 seconds.
I have another one coming for you shortly.
So have a sip of water, catch a breath.
[SPEAKER_11]: For Brent and Dieter,
[SPEAKER_11]: we currently have really two big systems.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are three, but essentially when
we're looking at the dispensaries and the
[SPEAKER_11]: MMPR, given the goals of public safety and
patient safety and accessibility,
[SPEAKER_11]: should we have one uniform system for
better health?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it look like the MMPR?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it look like dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it look like a hybrid of the two?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the tricky things that we
are facing as a country and as experts
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the things that I hope to hear
from all of you about as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's a bit of a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's somewhere down the middle.
[SPEAKER_18]: So dispensaries generally will need to
increase the quality of care that they're
[SPEAKER_18]: delivering and the consistency of the
product.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no reason that a consumer in any
market shouldn't have faith in what
[SPEAKER_18]: they're purchasing and know that it's
safe.
[SPEAKER_18]: No two questions about that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally, I think the MMPR is over
restrictive and many of the regulations
[SPEAKER_18]: are based on the fear of diversion instead
of the launch for quality product.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's an ideological issue
instead of a public health issue so that
[SPEAKER_18]: we'll meet in the middle eventually.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think storefront distribution is the
model everywhere else in the world and
[SPEAKER_18]: Canada, for its own reasons and
government, decided to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like with the previous programs,
court cases will stack up against it and
[SPEAKER_18]: we'll see a change over time.
[SPEAKER_18]: But given the amount of power and the
intelligence behind the MMPR and licensed
[SPEAKER_18]: producers, I think that they'll
effectively be able to lobby change a lot
[SPEAKER_18]: more than anybody was able to under the
MMPR.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think we'll meet in the middle
eventually because both have possible
[SPEAKER_18]: aspects for patient care.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: In some ways, the analogy I thought of was
that dispensaries are kind of like the
[SPEAKER_14]: explorers.
[SPEAKER_14]: After, since 1937, the new land and they
explored and they rediscovered the land
[SPEAKER_14]: that actually was discovered by the
Vikings and the First Nations before.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was rediscovered with Columbus and
Cook and so forth.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to a large extent, the dispensaries
were the explorers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we're in the pioneering phase.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in the pioneers of settling the land
and we're really trying to struggle to
[SPEAKER_14]: find our way.
[SPEAKER_14]: What it's going to look like, what it's
going to shape into.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not going to look like it is
today.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to change very significantly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as policy developers, it's going to be
driven by all kinds of agendas.
[SPEAKER_14]: The government has to make a safe for
patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is other interest groups that need
to make sure that they're covered.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's always big money that's involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: As he was alluding to, there's always a
scare of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's also an industry that's
waiting to change.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't think the pharmacies are going
to sit back forever?
[SPEAKER_14]: They're looking to get into the dispensing
game themselves in some way, shape,
[SPEAKER_14]: or form.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all it would take is for health Canada
to make a change in the laws for
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensing in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think eventually it's going to lead to a
gravitational pull where we have a
[SPEAKER_14]: standard of care system.
[SPEAKER_14]: How is it delivered to patients in the
future?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is going to be a role for
everybody, I think, in the future.
So Mark, this one's going to be for you.
Get ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: The MNPR is federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_11]: The delivery of health care services is
usually under the purview of the
[SPEAKER_11]: provincial government.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we have the Vancouver and,
as of today, the Victoria municipal
[SPEAKER_11]: governments kind of wading into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: What role should the provincial and the
municipal governments play in the
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation and distribution of the medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to answer that question in a
circuitous way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody here in this room should
write a letter to the local newspapers
[SPEAKER_06]: thanking the Vancouver Police Department.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because essentially, because they have
decided to not bust people for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have the situation that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is unusual.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you live in Vancouver, you kind of
think that this is normal until you travel
[SPEAKER_06]: across Canada and you go, this is not
normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a very progressive police
department.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they need to be publicly acknowledged
for what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so your question was, what role do the
various levels of government play?
What role should the municipal and
provincial government play?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that if you look at the health
authorities, the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_06]: city and the provincial government has
been one.
[SPEAKER_06]: The city does zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, there should be zoning issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where should dispensaries exist is a city
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't be clustered around the
corner where I live.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three on my block.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of strange, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be three on my block.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there should be a zoning issue for the
city place.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, it should be provincial.
[SPEAKER_06]: The model that I propose and the Health
Office Council proposes is a provincial
[SPEAKER_06]: commission that establishes the overall
arching goals and regulates the money
[SPEAKER_06]: flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, alcohol is sold
provincially.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cannabis should be the same.
And really, federal government should play
well at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a question about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you separate medical cannabis from
social or recreational cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_19]: model?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I think about the role of physicians
play, essentially, if you think about why
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians exist, it's because most
medicines have a relatively narrow window
[SPEAKER_06]: of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The point at which a medicine becomes
harmful is about a one to six ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't really matter what medicine
it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time you took a prescription
medicine, if you multiply what you took by
[SPEAKER_06]: six, you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's an unusual window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is way outside of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the risk profile of it is relatively
low.
[SPEAKER_06]: So quite frankly, I don't think we need
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we need people who have
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to have knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't really fit within the
medical world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really haven't stepped up to a
point to say, we're going to embrace this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're not chomping at the bit to
participate in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that there should be other
specialists, but not necessarily doctors.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so we're going to change topics again.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next topic that we're going to cover
is around the destigmatization of cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: in the mainstream medical community.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we continue to create more and more
acceptance and to have the mainstream
[SPEAKER_11]: medical community take cannabis seriously
to end the snickering and the kind of cute
[SPEAKER_11]: little pot jokes in order for us to be
able to create access for more patients
[SPEAKER_11]: across the country and even around the
world?
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brent, maybe you can first take a stab
at this question as you have been working
[SPEAKER_11]: with cannabis in a pretty different
culture than many of the people in this
[SPEAKER_11]: room have been.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've been working with clinicians
and mainstream medicine and sort of trying
[SPEAKER_11]: to give your company a very different
feel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do we need to go?
[SPEAKER_11]: And just a later one more question in
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it matter what the research and
evidence is that we come up with?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or will the stigmatization always exist?
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are two very loaded questions.
No problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, from the college's perspective on
doctors, I've talked to a number of
[SPEAKER_14]: doctors, and they always allude to the
fact that they're like 10 years behind the
[SPEAKER_14]: curve when it comes to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that in the human system,
one of the questions the doctors,
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have doctors teach other doctors,
everyone in this room has cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_14]: their system.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that same question was posed to a room
full of doctors.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they asked the doctors, how many of
you have cannabinoids in your system?
[SPEAKER_14]: Not one of them put up their hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, every one of you is a liar,
because they all have cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_14]: their system from the endocannabinoid
signal system.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the quiet operating system for
managing pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now medical communities are only
beginning to learn that the
[SPEAKER_14]: endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids
that we take exogenously, such as from
[SPEAKER_14]: smoking cannabis, actually mimic or
subsidize a natural system.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is like newsflash, these folks,
because they don't teach it in medical
[SPEAKER_14]: school.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't teach it in pharmacy school.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not there yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only starting to show up now in the
medical documents and saw how they're
[SPEAKER_14]: teaching how the exogenous cannabinoids
can actually impact and improve an
[SPEAKER_14]: individual's well-being.
[SPEAKER_14]: And listening to Dr. Mishum, I'm sure many
of you know who he is, he said that when
[SPEAKER_14]: he did his profile on just cannabidiol,
and he was head of post-doc, they were
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing how many conditions and disease
conditions of CBD or cannabidiol impacted
[SPEAKER_14]: in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_14]: He stopped personally at 19.
[SPEAKER_14]: When he had his post-doc do his research,
he found there was 96 disease conditions
[SPEAKER_14]: that CBD had a positive impact on people's
lives.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just really been the underdog of the
potentiation of this drug going forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the medical community can snicker for
now, but I think with time, we're going to
[SPEAKER_14]: see that science is going to lead the
charge on us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is that industry is coy to do
things in the herbal product, because
[SPEAKER_14]: who's going to be able to patent anything
when it's done?
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is the return going to be on that
investment?
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing you can get.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the truth of the matter is it's got
to be a sort of a public initiative.
[SPEAKER_14]: The way that we keep it out of the hands
of big corporate, I don't want to keep it
[SPEAKER_14]: corporate, how do you keep it,
is making sure that there isn't anything
[SPEAKER_14]: that really can be patented, that then
they can take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if you want to see if you want it,
that means it has to come from the public.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like ultimately, when we talk about
accessing cannabis, it should be done
[SPEAKER_14]: provincially, but it should fall under
the, I think, under the form in areas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Provinces all have form, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And that way, if it's under the form in
areas, it has access like any other drug
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have, that we take advantage of in
our system and have a share in them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's just a matter of having the
regulation, how you can get it under the
[SPEAKER_14]: form in areas, so that it has access for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't feel like I had a hard time
listening to mothers who had to choose
[SPEAKER_14]: between groceries and their medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else want to comment?
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a lot of the stigma that comes
along with medical cannabis or cannabis in
[SPEAKER_18]: general is because it's illegal,
and that's a huge portion of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it shouldn't be on the schedule.
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be removed, moved down to a
natural health product, and then we can
[SPEAKER_18]: treat it like any other herbal product.
[SPEAKER_18]: It shouldn't be special.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a double-edged sword when we say
that this product and this product alone
[SPEAKER_18]: needs to be treated very much like they're
not caught at.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think a lot of that stigma is
because we're prescribing something that,
[SPEAKER_18]: although it has medical applications,
we were told for 50 years it was bad.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a strong step and a strong message
would be to move it where it probably
[SPEAKER_18]: deserves to be, which would be a natural
health product.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we move past all of this
regulatory quagmire and provinces can just
[SPEAKER_18]: say, okay, we're going to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it makes it a lot simpler.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to jam a square peg around
the whole, and it's creating a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_18]: of problems around stigma.
And that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_19]: More so in Canada than I think in the U
.S., for example, where you have
[SPEAKER_19]: Republicans and Democrats talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, it's not going to happen,
but we just have to pry it away from that
[SPEAKER_19]: being a political issue into a regulatory
issue, a health issue, an economics issue,
[SPEAKER_19]: and not somebody's sort of cudgel to hit
their political opponent with,
[SPEAKER_19]: which is what it's turned into.
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, we may have a few more
years of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's one thing we need to do is to
fix that problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have time for a bonus question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonus round.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to jump to an entirely
other topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that none of you are really
experts in this space, but we think that
[SPEAKER_11]: this is an important conversation that
should be on the radar in Canada right
[SPEAKER_11]: now, at least I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some folks have consulted on
architecting these questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a sense of what the
environmental impact and what the carbon
[SPEAKER_11]: footprint is of cannabis production in
Canada between the NNPR and the NNAR and
[SPEAKER_11]: the legal cultivators?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any sense of what the carbon
footprint is and how can we start reducing
[SPEAKER_11]: it?
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a study by an engineer or
physicist in Berkeley, California a few
[SPEAKER_19]: years ago by an Evan Mills who made the
news for some work he did on analyzing a
[SPEAKER_19]: certain carbon footprint of the cannabis
industry in California and extrapolating
[SPEAKER_19]: from mainly the indoor marijuana
cultivation industry in California and
[SPEAKER_19]: extrapolating to the rest of the US.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the number he came up with was
something like 1% of the electricity
[SPEAKER_19]: consumed in the US was used towards
marijuana production and 3% in California.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the calculation was something like a
joint, which he calculated at about a
[SPEAKER_19]: third of a gram, which is, you know,
plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, it's kind of a small joint.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like leaving a 100 watt light bulb
on for 75 hours in terms of the amount of
[SPEAKER_19]: power that goes into that joint.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you know how you tell your kids or
something like turn off the lights when
[SPEAKER_19]: you leave the room, you know, 75 hours of
that joint.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if you look at what Health Canada
has projected, and obviously NNPR is not
[SPEAKER_19]: growing very rapidly or as rapidly as
people thought, but if they're going to
[SPEAKER_19]: hit the number of patients, is it three or
four hundred thousand projected?
[SPEAKER_19]: And you multiply that by, you know,
a gram and a quarter a day and,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, all the sort of stats.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're looking at, you know,
the carbon or the energy consumption of
[SPEAKER_19]: something like the city of cannabis,
I think, and then we calculate all that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if we're really focused and,
you know, I visited Tilray and Philippe
[SPEAKER_19]: showed some really nice pictures.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a wonderful facility.
[SPEAKER_19]: And as clean as a whistle, I'm sure
Brian's facility is equally amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is like thick concrete and huge
numbers of lights.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're, you know, putting a lot of
energy into that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there is, it is a plant that has this
sort of trick.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it comes from the San Jose.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also, you know, and Brent knows
this from driving around Saskatchewan,
[SPEAKER_19]: as I have as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's about, about 90,000 acres of hemp
being grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is cannabis sativa, adored,
you know, in big sections of land in
[SPEAKER_19]: Saskatchewan and Manitoba and Alberta.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's actually producing a lot of the
same chemistry, not THC, my view,
[SPEAKER_19]: but, you know, CBD or cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think, you know, how you reconcile
quality control where you're keeping
[SPEAKER_19]: everything as clean as you want for
patients, but not, not having to use
[SPEAKER_19]: artificial lighting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe that's towards extracts and other
things and derivatives that you can have
[SPEAKER_19]: crops that are grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're extracted for THC and CBD and
other, ventriloids and other things you
[SPEAKER_19]: want.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're processed into a clean,
standardized extract without, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: HPS lights and all the other stuff that
goes on the doors.
So I'd like to expand the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was on the panel organized by Dan
Larson in the not-too-distant past.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was talking about the importance of
not advertising cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Emery, who was on the panel,
had a really interesting response.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he said is that alcohol is
advertised, that cannabis is less harmful
[SPEAKER_06]: than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it substitutes, as Philip Lucas has
pointed out, that's a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought his point was valid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to look not just at what
cannabis does in terms of carbon
[SPEAKER_06]: footprint, but in terms of health and
burden of disease footprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it reduces consumption of alcohol,
which is quite frankly, well, I don't buy
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of hard drug and soft drug,
but if I did, alcohol is a hard drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if cannabis reduced our social
consumption of alcohol, our society would
[SPEAKER_06]: be healthier.
So
[SPEAKER_11]: we can take some questions from the
audience.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the question of how do we reduce our
carbon footprint, you know, we have to
[SPEAKER_14]: turn to technology to a certain extent
too, because yeah, in the indoor
[SPEAKER_14]: cultivation, it's all about the lights and
about all the systems for managing
[SPEAKER_14]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, we're not harnessing half
of the solar power potential that we have.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's all the other efficiencies in
terms of the equipment and some of the
[SPEAKER_14]: better technology that's coming with
equipment these days that can do these
[SPEAKER_14]: things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so to your point, the motivation has
to be there to come up with better
[SPEAKER_14]: systems, even though the cost might be per
kilowatt might be higher, it can still be
[SPEAKER_14]: deployed in a much more meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because obviously, if there's a roof,
there's those flat areas that the solar
[SPEAKER_14]: panel is going to be on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not to say that it's going to be
100% internal.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that, you know, as the
industry starts to grow, we'll start to
[SPEAKER_14]: learn to think about being more green and
having to rely to technology to sort of
[SPEAKER_14]: help to reduce that carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we hit on some topics that you found
interesting and useful and okay,
[SPEAKER_11]: good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I have some questions for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you do not have to out yourself,
obviously, if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm wondering how many people in the
room are associated with a medical
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis dispensary?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many people in the room are
associated with a licensed producer?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many people are associated with a
clinic that is authorizing patients access
[SPEAKER_11]: to either dispensaries or LPs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many people, and again,
you don't have to know yourself if you
[SPEAKER_11]: don't want to, how many people in the room
use cannabis as a medicine?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there researchers here?
[SPEAKER_11]: Any researchers?
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any media?
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the guy behind the camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you count as media?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: And are there folks here who are really
here to learn and are looking to find a
[SPEAKER_11]: place to get involved in this business?
[SPEAKER_11]: A few of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, how many of you have a question or
comment that you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have a look.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a ton of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, maybe we'll get warmed up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there somebody in the room who uses
cannabis as a medicine who would like to
[SPEAKER_11]: ask a question?
[SPEAKER_11]: Patients first.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you might be speaking out for free.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a roving mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it doesn't work, you can come on up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it all right if it's not a question
associated with my medical use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to give somebody who uses
cannabis as a medicine the first right to
[SPEAKER_11]: speak.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can ask whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try and keep it to a minute if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark made me think about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in regards to spreading the
wealth a little bit and reducing harm by
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the wealth of this emerging
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be really aware,
cognizant about all of the people that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know, people in this room, that we know
who support their families and their
[SPEAKER_01]: livelihood has been in producing cannabis
in the cottage underground industry for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 40 years in this province.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge part of our economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we steward those people out of
an illegal industry and into this emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: legal industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for me, it seems like something
that might be underreported, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be on the scale of like the end
of the cod fishery in New Pumash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I feel like it's on the same
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an economic tragedy that's coming
towards PC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like for us to talk about that
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what you're saying is really
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end of alcohol prohibition,
it was a thoughtful process that included
[SPEAKER_06]: the illegal dealers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's actually really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: So acknowledged as a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's partly why I say we need to
keep it small.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we should keep it small and
include the illegal growers and dealers,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever, the whole process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just livelihoods,
but it's also the whole egalitarian issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very, very important point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and we're not right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not acknowledged at that point.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to add, I mean, I think it's clear
it's very much a sort of rural development
[SPEAKER_19]: type issue in DC as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I grew up on Bank of Rydell.
[SPEAKER_19]: Logging sort of declined, where crews were
large and then they were extremely small.
[SPEAKER_19]: And fishing declined as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: But marijuana production certainly
supplemented the income of lots of
[SPEAKER_19]: resource workers and others as well in
places like Gulf of Gulf Island.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the extension of NNAR under the Alar
case has sort of kept that going,
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, in some ways.
[SPEAKER_19]: But one of the things also is price
fluctuations have changed the business a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Washington State legalizing has
changed things a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I do think that if you talk to car
dealers in the Kootenays about where
[SPEAKER_19]: pickup trucks were funded by, I mean,
it was a huge part of those economies.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it could dry up.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like the cotton industry or another
industry that could go.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the conundrums that's going to be
in the drivers, in the debate,
[SPEAKER_14]: is the standards for which safety and the
wholly controlled assets are going to
[SPEAKER_14]: weigh into this, both federally and
provincially.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what they're going to demand there be,
because if there's a trade-off,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there's all these other
requirements for quality control and
[SPEAKER_14]: testing and things that are required to do
and things of safety, those all cost
[SPEAKER_14]: money.
[SPEAKER_14]: They all stack up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so then it becomes a function of a
straight economy to scale.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where the problem comes in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you can't, at some point,
you can't produce it cheap enough if all
[SPEAKER_14]: the criteria is the bar keeps getting
higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to have enough horsepower,
enough assets on the ground in order to
[SPEAKER_14]: make it the goal of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have to, like in Saskatchewan,
and that was the idea I used a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: times in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_14]: The average farm size was about a section,
or 640 acres.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the economy changed, and everything
else has moved forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: The average farm size today in
Saskatchewan is 5,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not uncommon to see a father and son
managing, just two of them, managing
[SPEAKER_14]: 10,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just because economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_14]: Equipment got bigger, the price of cotton
got better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that was just a natural evolution.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just saying from a standpoint of
thinking about this, I think a lot is
[SPEAKER_14]: going to be driven by what?
The government bodies are going to demand
how the product should be shaped,
how it should be made safe for patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to drive a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to add to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Colorado, they created 10,000 jobs in a
year for cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that these jobs are going
away by any means.
[SPEAKER_05]: About 50% of the jobs at Tilray are
actually production jobs right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: working directly with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely agree that the shift is going
to be, to some extent, out of some rural
[SPEAKER_05]: areas and maybe into more populated areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: But out of the employment that Tilray has
created, we've created about twice that
[SPEAKER_05]: much just in ancillary services as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we're working with VIU to
specifically develop curriculum with their
[SPEAKER_05]: horticultural program and their MBA
program so that their students can come
[SPEAKER_05]: right in at Tilray and know the system
that we're working in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not suggesting by any means that this
is only going to be governed by big
[SPEAKER_05]: companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's got to be small and medium-sized
companies as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that actually that's one of the
big shifts we're going to see in the next
[SPEAKER_05]: few years is these niche producers and
these niche areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that even Whistler in some ways is
doing that right now as well by producing
[SPEAKER_05]: organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think these jobs are going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they will come up from the
underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that even when I ran a dispensary
for 10 years, when people start growing
[SPEAKER_05]: medical marijuana, and they do so on a
more legitimate basis rather than just
[SPEAKER_05]: going for the recreational market,
they can start talking to their friends
[SPEAKER_05]: and family about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can not have this dichotomy in their
lives, but they have to hide what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing from half the people they know and
only express it with the other half.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that as this industry legitimizes,
that's what we're going to see happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to point out that although
there may be a lot of jobs that are
[SPEAKER_09]: created, I think that that is a very
different kind of job from being your own
[SPEAKER_09]: boss, having your own business,
to becoming an employee.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a significant pay cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of having your own shops,
you're suddenly an employee at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a huge difference to all of those
families, so I don't think it's the same
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a bit misleading to say these
jobs have been created when it's uprooting
[SPEAKER_09]: all of these other small businesses that
provide a much larger amount of money to
those families.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions or comments from the
floor?
[SPEAKER_11]: You were pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was in the carbon footprint
discussion, there appeared to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: perceived dichotomy between doing stuff
indoors and having excellent quality
[SPEAKER_02]: control and doing stuff outdoors and being
able to use the sun and therefore not have
[SPEAKER_02]: a big carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember David Hutchinson telling me
a couple of years ago about this amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: technology where you grow indoors and use
the sun, call it a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a laughable term to use?
[SPEAKER_18]: A viable alternative in terms of... Under
the MMDR it certainly is, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_18]: restrictive.
[SPEAKER_18]: They make it somewhat difficult for
licensed producers to produce it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It can be done and it is being done.
[SPEAKER_18]: Greenhouses, especially in lower
Vancouver, work very well.
[SPEAKER_18]: They get full year-round growing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think in the carbon footprint thing and
talking about derivatives, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_18]: going to plug the derivatives here,
the idea is that the growth in this
[SPEAKER_18]: market, if we were given the chance to,
would be in derivatives.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't imagine that raw cannabis would be
more than 20% of the total market share at
[SPEAKER_18]: 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_18]: The nice thing about derivative products
is you don't have to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of what we've seen adopted in all
these legal markets all over the place are
[SPEAKER_18]: actually functions of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've taken the legal market or illicit
and moved it to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_18]: Coming back to the jobs, part of that is
the prices that people pay right now are
[SPEAKER_18]: based on prohibition and I think we're
going to see a market correction.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at the wine industry,
it gets priced to a point where you don't
[SPEAKER_18]: really make money from making wine in your
basement.
[SPEAKER_18]: All these people that are growing
illegally right now, they do make a lot of
[SPEAKER_18]: money and it would be a shame to see those
jobs lost.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll need to transition into the legal
market because eventually this artificial
[SPEAKER_18]: price, which is based on artificial
scarcity through regulation, is going to
[SPEAKER_18]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no two ways about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You just have to be aware of that and
transition out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, outdoor production will be a
large part.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no reason we shouldn't be growing
massive fields of outdoor cannabis in
Kelowna.
It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the difficulties that's going to
come into this is how organizations,
[SPEAKER_14]: how government not only regulate this
industry from within the country,
[SPEAKER_14]: but also what happens from imports and
exports.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were involved in the nutraceutical
industry way back in the early days.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a number of farmers and a budding
industry that was getting started in the
[SPEAKER_14]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were supplying them plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't take inside of three years
before they started sourcing it from
[SPEAKER_14]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_14]: It completely wiped out the nutraceutical
production in Western Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: It completely wiped it out because of
economics and the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we successfully in moving this
continuum, you've got to be aware that the
[SPEAKER_14]: next drag, and then it'll show up,
is that we'll be facing incoming product
[SPEAKER_14]: from India and from Southeast Asia,
Jamaica, and it'll be really dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will drive the farmers out of business
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to be careful of what we wish
for because we need a regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_14]: that protects against some of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, all the farmers, including
ours, will be non-existent.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll go to the price of the lowest
common denominator if the continuum
[SPEAKER_14]: continues to go, if we don't learn our
lessons from what happened to the
[SPEAKER_14]: nutraceutical business.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some great conversations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to take another question from a
woman, if there's a woman that has a
[SPEAKER_11]: question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here on behalf of the Big Seek and
Passion Club Society.
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of you probably know us.
[SPEAKER_17]: We are the boringest dispensary in Canada.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been around for 18 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: We provide hundreds of thousands of
dollars every year in other treatment
[SPEAKER_17]: options as well as Canada's.
[SPEAKER_17]: My question to the panel probably to Mark
is, as people that profit off of medicine,
[SPEAKER_17]: what is our responsibility?
[SPEAKER_17]: What's our obligation to give back to
patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what the answer is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really interested in how money flows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start with a larger answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look at a public health approach,
a public health approach says the money
[SPEAKER_06]: should be funneled back, so it shouldn't
be used just for general revenue.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think about when governments make
money, they stick it to general revenue,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they spend it on whatever,
including buying phones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that in a public health model,
the money should basically be funneled
[SPEAKER_06]: into public health initiatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be mental health treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be addiction treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite frankly, it would be high quality
education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our education system is not doing well
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting it into high schools and primary
schools, so essentially in the model that
[SPEAKER_06]: the Health Officers Council and myself are
advocating for, the commission would
[SPEAKER_06]: funnel the money into things that support
the public health.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of my question.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of my answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think my understanding of your
organization is you do have this whole
[SPEAKER_06]: other thing that you do give back,
which is your other medicines piece,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I took a tour of it a little while
ago, I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it wasn't just about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you did a good job for that,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: On healing, I think it's a good point to
hear.
[SPEAKER_15]: Healing is the endogenous ability of life
to return from a state of disease to a
[SPEAKER_15]: state of health.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what medicine is all about,
is healing patients.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cannabis, and this goes to the
environmental side, is a holistic
[SPEAKER_15]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I mean is the whole is greater than
the sum of its parts.
[SPEAKER_15]: We say it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes CO2 out of the air and produces
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_15]: As was said before, it can take
radioactive elements out of soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole plant, its genome, and its life
cycle is healing the planet, not just the
[SPEAKER_15]: patients that need it, but through its
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is beneficial for the whole planet.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to heal all of us together,
but we need to find sustainable methods
[SPEAKER_15]: for producing it in sync with our
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can have something that is good and
it's going to change the world in a very
[SPEAKER_15]: positive way, but we have to think about
that and think about the whole chain of
[SPEAKER_15]: production, because with pharmaceuticals,
it starts with oil, and it's taken out of
[SPEAKER_15]: the ground, and it's refined, and then
it's transported, and then there's a
[SPEAKER_15]: synthesis, and all these steps are
releasing pollutants and releasing CO2,
[SPEAKER_15]: so we're moving to a new way where we're
producing medicine sustainably,
[SPEAKER_15]: and we can produce medicine where it's a
public health thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's getting healthier because of
the way we're doing things, and this is
[SPEAKER_15]: where it needs to go.
I
[SPEAKER_13]: was just going to make a point to respond
to the fellows, the blue shirt and the
[SPEAKER_13]: lady over here, about business
opportunities, and I think this is one of
[SPEAKER_13]: the most exciting times in history.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we'll look back 50 years from now
and say, wow, we missed a huge
[SPEAKER_13]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're an EMMAR grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Start a business.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do what Chuck Rafizi over here did.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two years ago, nobody heard a tweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: A tweet is a Canadian success story
because they had the force of sight and
[SPEAKER_13]: the wherewithal to go and raise money and
do what it takes to build a business,
[SPEAKER_13]: and there's no reason that you can't do
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: The reality is Tilbury's a long way away
from being Walmart.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a startup business, and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going to happen in 20 years in this
space is going to be really exciting to
[SPEAKER_13]: see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the companies, the Board of
Happeners, Organics, very interesting
[SPEAKER_13]: company.
[SPEAKER_13]: John Krent is behind that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows where that company could go?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no reason that you can't do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
Are there any other women that have a
question or a comment?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like to try and draw out the
quieter voices.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make a comment.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an anti-prohibitionist, and I don't
really deal too much with the medicinal
[SPEAKER_12]: aspect of things, but I am very excited
that you are talking about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's going to be critical as
both the medicinal and the recreational or
[SPEAKER_12]: legal market moves forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think sustainability is critical.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm starting at the beginning tonight
talking about how little harm cannabis
[SPEAKER_21]: actually does.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a fraction of people that have
treatment problems may have compromised
[SPEAKER_21]: immune systems.
[SPEAKER_21]: You are talking about how doctors are
needed to talk about prescribed medicines
[SPEAKER_21]: because they have this real harmful effect
if you take so many times more than you're
[SPEAKER_21]: supposed to have.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cannabis isn't even happening at all.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to end stigmatization,
end the re-format, but stop talking about
[SPEAKER_21]: public safety.
[SPEAKER_21]: Alcohol is so much more harmful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Prescription drugs, cigarettes,
water is more harmful than cannabis.
That's where the real problem I see is
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Our civic government in Vancouver thinks
we need to have dispensaries 300 meters,
[SPEAKER_21]: three football fields away from schools
because kids can't see marijuana leads in
[SPEAKER_21]: windows.
[SPEAKER_21]: Mark, you said there shouldn't be any
products that are visible.
[SPEAKER_21]: I see liquor stores all over the place
with their products in the windows and big
[SPEAKER_21]: signs saying, come and drink our booze.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we're living in a crazy world.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're having these kinds of discussions.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all this money on public safety about
the number one safest thing in our
[SPEAKER_21]: environment.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your comment.
Can I just address that one first?
[SPEAKER_18]: Using liquor as your measuring stick is
probably a bad idea just because they do
[SPEAKER_18]: it doesn't mean we should.
[SPEAKER_18]: One.
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, there are actually harms associated
with cannabis use if it doesn't come with
[SPEAKER_18]: education.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I write hypergesis in it?
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that we're seeing more
frequently.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've checked the work that we've done in
the cannabis industry to show that it's
[SPEAKER_18]: healing and helpful to a backfire.
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand where you're coming from,
but there's a step and a path for
[SPEAKER_18]: everything and we're on that path and it
may just take a little longer than
[SPEAKER_18]: everyone here is hoping.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting to look at the different
tracks that alcohol and tobacco were on
[SPEAKER_06]: over a 40-year period.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first bought alcohol in Ontario X
number of years ago, I walked into a blank
[SPEAKER_06]: room with black and white text on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I filled out a pencil-filled card that I
handed to somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no product in sight,
no advertising in sight.
[SPEAKER_06]: He handed me back a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't actually get to see the label of
any alcohol products until I walked out
[SPEAKER_06]: the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly over the years, we've moved away
from a public health model to regulating
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol, but we've increased our public
health involvement with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tobacco has gone from being widely stated
advertising to advertising in magazines.
[SPEAKER_06]: X number of doctors recommend smoking
tobacco with the advertising of the day 30
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago, 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a public health model for the
regulation of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: More so, we still have branded products.
[SPEAKER_06]: The warning sign isn't the whole package
yet and it's still colourful logo-wise,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly the public health model increases
with tobacco, but decreasing with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to look at both of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one of those do we want with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend that we have a public
health approach to regulation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to recognise what Tyler and
David have created here this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look around this room and I see the most
incredible room of advocates, academics,
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers, doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an incredible combination of
energy within this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect all of the people sat on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too, gentlemen, for arranging this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I see as one of them in the room
is we still have a federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a health minister, as the big C
people know, because she was here just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks ago, publicly stating that
marijuana is not medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them away from that mindset,
or are they a lost cause?
[SPEAKER_14]: I was talking to my dad about two weeks
ago about the woes of Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had now 15 years of Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: In previous to that, I helped my dad build
a CDO, a community-based organisation
[SPEAKER_14]: dedicated to the care of intellectual
disability adults, in helping them get
[SPEAKER_14]: meaningful work and give them life's talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said to him, you know, it's not much of
a stretch when it has to do with Health
[SPEAKER_14]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think the federal government is
going to move from their fear paradigm.
[SPEAKER_14]: Their entire modus operandi is based on
fear.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fear coming out of the box.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fear of doing anything that's going to
make them not get elected.
[SPEAKER_14]: It transcends right down to the
bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fear of getting fired if it makes the
wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_14]: After working with them, it's all based on
fear.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their big motivator.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they're trying really hard,
because they know that they're accountable
[SPEAKER_14]: to us, the electorate, the voting public.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a fear culture, especially with
the Darth Vader Prime Minister we have
[SPEAKER_14]: today.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a fear regime.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have a little bitterness towards the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is, it's going to take a
long time to get the government to come to
[SPEAKER_14]: any kind of common sense on this.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to be dragged, screaming,
and kicking, and that's the end of the
[SPEAKER_14]: day.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have time for one more question,
and I'm going to give it to Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, who?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been speaking about cannabis as a
medicine for quite some time, and it has
[SPEAKER_16]: been a medicine far longer than it's been
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a certified horticulture technician
that's worked as a designated rower for
[SPEAKER_16]: Health Canada I've also been a
horticulture therapist in the psychiatric
[SPEAKER_16]: ward in Nanaimo, and also founder of a
cannabis dispensary two years ago,
[SPEAKER_16]: one that I'm not working with anymore.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's been this great divide that I
see with plants and people, and the whole
[SPEAKER_16]: process in relation to it.
[SPEAKER_16]: My question is, how can we get it to be
recognized as more of a holistic process,
[SPEAKER_16]: and bridge the gap between the
relationship between patients and the
[SPEAKER_16]: plants?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because even seeing people in highly
psychotic episodes touching the soil,
[SPEAKER_16]: and breathing in the microbes,
and feeling the entrainment of the
[SPEAKER_16]: positive outcome, or the energy from that,
we're putting everything in the box,
[SPEAKER_16]: and not allowing people to have that kind
of therapy anymore.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a solution to getting those
people the opportunity?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you look at normal Canada,
at least for me, I didn't really
[SPEAKER_18]: understand what the context was,
and then I started thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cannabis is apparently special in all
sorts of ways.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not supposed to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the end goal is that cannabis no
longer is special, at least not special in
[SPEAKER_18]: the ways that we think it is right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to become foreign, and then we
can rediscover that potential,
[SPEAKER_18]: and then it will find its own place in
society like anything else.
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as we keep making exceptions for
it, whether it be regulation, society,
[SPEAKER_18]: or law, it doesn't matter, then it will be
limited in its applications like anything
[SPEAKER_18]: else.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: Eventually, down the road, I think it will
be commonplace to some degree,
[SPEAKER_18]: and that means it will reconnect in the
way that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_18]: Certain people choose to use it that way,
but it's still too special at this point.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a hot potato.
[SPEAKER_18]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to quickly say thank you so
much for this platform.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's so amazing that we can brainstorm and
talk about things associated with
[SPEAKER_20]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there anything that we can do from a
grassroots level to legitimize and slowly
[SPEAKER_20]: push this sector forward?
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there something that we can do right
now that we can help?
[SPEAKER_06]: The battle will be fought in the media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any way of engaging the media around this
discussion is actually really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even things like when there's an article
that comes out, pro or con drugs
[SPEAKER_06]: generally, you can find it online,
and there's room for comments at the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read the comments, quite frankly,
they're usually obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not skillful.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not skillful, thoughtful,
intelligent, paw out discussions about
[SPEAKER_06]: drug policy issues in our society.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're these flame wars that happen,
which essentially, think that a politician
[SPEAKER_06]: is reading this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think that a politician will read your
comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the best thing that we could all
do is actually engage the media every way
[SPEAKER_06]: we can, and you can engage them today by
finding the next drug prohibition article
[SPEAKER_06]: and commenting in a really skillful way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: John first, and then Brent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just quickly, I think we have to avoid
this divide and conquer, LPs versus
[SPEAKER_19]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need a united front.
[SPEAKER_19]: As you can see from the LP discussions,
the dispensary discussions, people are on
[SPEAKER_19]: the same side.
[SPEAKER_19]: Split may be by Health Canada talking
about things differently, but I think
[SPEAKER_19]: there's a lot of common ground,
and we have to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brent.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that as you weigh into that,
the media is a very effective tool to
[SPEAKER_14]: weigh in on and comment on the media,
but you also know that politicians,
[SPEAKER_14]: even though they're fear-based,
they do listen.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to listen, and when you have two
letters on the same subject coming to a
[SPEAKER_14]: politician, they're obligated to respond,
so it really is becoming activists in the
[SPEAKER_14]: sense of coming up with a pragmatic
writing of a letter to the politicians,
[SPEAKER_14]: both federally and provincially,
that will have the greatest impact.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as the theme emerges, it takes the
ones that are really off the wall,
[SPEAKER_14]: and are angry, and they're disenchanting,
and they're actually violent, they'll
[SPEAKER_14]: throw those away.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's a well-thought-through letter,
and there's more than one on the same
[SPEAKER_14]: theme, they have to respond to it,
and it becomes a political issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that from your standpoint,
that's probably the most effective use of
[SPEAKER_14]: the time it's getting to a politician.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's time for some thank-yous.
And first of all, I want to thank Lyft for
creating the venue, and for architecting
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to thank Bedro Ken,
who supported me in taking this role,
[SPEAKER_11]: and also supported me taking a significant
amount of time to work on these questions,
[SPEAKER_11]: and to work with the panelists and David
to develop a meaningful conversation,
[SPEAKER_11]: because these are the kinds of
conversations we need to be having,
[SPEAKER_11]: and they take time and work.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate all the input from the
panelists and from David, and I hope that
[SPEAKER_11]: we'll be able to do this again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really want to thank you.
There are people in this room,
like Dana Larson, who is quiet tonight,
which doesn't happen very often.
I've been working on this for 20 years,
and does he really need to come out to
[SPEAKER_11]: another cannabis event in the middle of
the week?
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's here to listen and participate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is how we're going to move this
forward in a meaningful way, to be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: take care of patients, and take care of
the people who have been working in this
[SPEAKER_11]: community for a long time, and find a way
to balance business, and grassroots needs,
[SPEAKER_11]: and science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Health Canada is not going to lead us
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to find our way with more
intelligent, meaningful conversations like
[SPEAKER_11]: this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a big round of applause for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for another applause.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be really fast to close up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a reminder that there's an
industry networking event after this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to go through the
Blackford Public House on 905 Dunsbury
[SPEAKER_10]: Street.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that was incorrect, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is transportation that Apple
Organics has arranged, and it's supposed
[SPEAKER_10]: to be up front.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what that means, because this
is a square.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can find this transportation,
it should take you there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also want to mention that we are
holding another forum in Toronto on July
[SPEAKER_10]: 20th.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have to provide yourself a
Toronto there, we'd love to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, a big round of applause.
[SPEAKER_10]: For all of our speakers and our panelists.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, and have a fantastic night.
Thank you.
Thank you.
