[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, just about to head into Remo's
room here, thought I'd bring you with me
[SPEAKER_04]: for a little tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the green light on, I've got the
camera set for the right white balance,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the orange light should come through
nice and green for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should warn you guys, this is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let me just get these doors all
closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go, Remo's style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, I get to come into a lot of grow
rooms, but I gotta tell ya, coming into
[SPEAKER_04]: Remo's grow room is unlike going into any
grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look what he's got right in front
of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got this incredible shrub-like plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice smell on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: CT?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a lot of the dinofemicids in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynachem is one, I believe he's got
Rockstar, potentially UBC chemo Kush,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Amnesia, yeah, the back row is chemo
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start out with what we know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is purple plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been right in this very spot shooting
with the macro lens before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually about to get in here and
shoot with my macro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm here to do today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Film a couple of small videos with Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really spectacular quality on that,
as always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remo just brings the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got happening here?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here's the chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another chemo right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how big this plant is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty decent size.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got over here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta check out original Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the original Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also from dinofem.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these seeds came from Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Remo picked them up from
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is gonna be a little tour here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a Rockstar from Seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant is about seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back and show you that Rockstar
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really give you the close up on
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, is this the Amnesia here?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is a dinofem.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the dinofem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's give that a little...
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over to the chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: White OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are white OGs right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The white OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you an idea on some of the stalks on
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a big old stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you an idea of how big these monsters
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could hang out in here forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got a chemo on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a Rockstar on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Rockstar from Seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is one big nugget.
Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta tell you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is happy, happy times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging out here in Remo's room.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy is so good at what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an inspiration to the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And growing out people's genetics on the
regular.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't stick to what he knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: He literally will give what is... If
something is supposed to be decent,
[SPEAKER_04]: he'll give it a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll put his efforts into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: More often than not.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll produce something... I mean,
if I personally was a breeder,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would absolutely want Remo, the urban
grower, to grow some of my strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I could do this all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get to shooting now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've got an hour and a half left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna be very busy shooting the
macros, so why don't you guys puff some
[SPEAKER_04]: bowls and we'll catch up with you in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dinocam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Remo, the urban grower,
and Swan, one of his many cameraman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the main cameraman, you seem to be
the... He's the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy behind the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to do a short video
today on bringing Remo some gifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I cut these out of my garden this
morning and we've got...
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet Skunk and Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all special.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to tell you anything about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Congolese is a special strain from
Africa that is very wanted and loved by
[SPEAKER_04]: many.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Astro Boy is a TGA genetic,
sub-cool strain, and that is the Apollo 13
[SPEAKER_04]: male pollen pit plant, which was an Ortega
crossed with a C99.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it stacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fruity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're really going to like that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown the Sweet Skunk before because
Steve Covey gave me a cutting of this and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: People used to come up to me and go,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've smoked the Congolese with Al the
Alchemist and it was outstanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Al the Alchemist has the Congolese,
so now you've got the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, many, many thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put them to good use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will flower these plants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your monster joint lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to hand them over to the
Hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some nice clean clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bug-free, mold-free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use some of my cloning gel on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I use Rimmel's Roots on all my
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to give you some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: we just spent about two hours in the
garden and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some big plants, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some beauties in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think six varieties we went through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six different kinds of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: UBC Chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medman's Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The White OG from Karma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dyna Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dyna Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Dynafem's version of Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Amnesia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Dynafem again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And didn't they have a third one that you
had?
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Plus.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again from Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dynafem, for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they sure looked great.
[SPEAKER_04]: The resin was stinky and smelly and it was
just nice to see a mix of the BC strains
[SPEAKER_04]: with even some Dutch flowers and then some
of those Spanish varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should make some great medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sure will.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure made some beautiful photos,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, double timing.
What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Solving the stab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably vegan, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made with water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will volunteer for the dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready for the dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's go time.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the quartz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the D-nail with the mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exodus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Urban No-Slow Tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that really takes your breath away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is his Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the stuff you had in Toronto,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you had special ice packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep it cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I lent him some of those ice packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to need a joint to settle that
toke down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to rip my face off.
[SPEAKER_02]: My god, I'm sweating.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got all sorts of buds on the
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stashes of your regular?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's actually some white OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got some Dynafem, phenyl
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Critical Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Critical Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Critical Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pretty much have them all,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here on display.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Dynafem stacked pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some goo goodness oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made with iso, not butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the hardest of rock, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like shattered.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some hardest of rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show that to the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's golden and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you can see right through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: See right through that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So which one was one of your favorites out
of all these that you grew?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you love yours, but besides yours,
did the white OG always kick?
[SPEAKER_02]: The white OG, I've always liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unbelievable weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not burn you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like it's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Dynafem collection, I really
enjoy Dynachem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just one phenyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that one phenyl that we looked
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of purple in that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew that one before, and it's got a
great flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I photographed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very heady weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right across the one that's green,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the other phenyl in there that
makes the bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have some of that left here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good, but the other one,
the chunky one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, phenyl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, man, I'm glad to have been invited
over here again and get to film in your
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful garden, get to photograph,
and get to bring you some gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come by and photograph any time you want,
or if you just want to come by and
[SPEAKER_02]: medicate, you're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My door is always open to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World,
and we'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so you got the UBC Chemo Kush
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of your favorites, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I won a cup last year in Toronto,
treating yourself with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took first place?
[SPEAKER_02]: It took first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it from a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a legend around this that it was
created at UBC for people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting cancer on chemotherapy,
and this was supposed to relieve their
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that's true or not, I have no
idea, but it has become one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Packs a punch, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 24% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very photogenic as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the most photogenic plants
I've shot with my medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Macro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It creates a lot of anthocyanin,
the purpling, and the capitate stalks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really all in all, it's just a super
beautiful little plant, and I'm just super
[SPEAKER_04]: stoked to throw it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again for sharing your time with
us, Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, yo, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go and practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, the Timber Rock weed is feeling real
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a puff of white.
How do you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I jam one, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homegrown, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that sue the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed let I view the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been traveling to Kingston for
20 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not slipping on my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fat like the clock floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh vegetation with trees and with
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to stop and shake my ganja,
lift them up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a biggie, because I don't want no
ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give me no palm, just give me time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want no twiggy, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No to pop, give me one biggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's bigger than biggie from a high
grade, give me me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff, puff, and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff, puff, and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff, puff, and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: No from your city, my south end or my dark
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not fear of some person is an high grade
past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the scent, I couldn't pass that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tell them load up the country,
let me draw that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before me like that, me have to bless
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause of the good old lams, break up me
quick puff and pass that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purpose of the weed that keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that's through the
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed let I view the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do it's purpose of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do it's purpose of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I imagine down the road there'll be
some cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Setting up them plat and scheme and all
the wrecking, all the weed traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But true man are us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man weed rems, don't rems, and tell me off
rems and pass that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up on new scene, two pound intervene.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my brain, stay that keen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And behind the scene, me and my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have another 25 pound tea for me,
then we smoke it half clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man are us now.
