[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with my good friend and partner
Ashley in cannabinoid research and
[SPEAKER_03]: development and a new friend that we just
made today, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, good to have you here with us bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man, so Ryan and I are going to be
heading to Negril in about an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rented an SUV truck and in fact,
here's the poster right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go, actually this is the
poster for the soccer match that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be coming back from Negril on the
8th.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Sunday we'll be at the soccer game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that we'll be at the Stepping High
Festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Russ Bobby from Aya Media is putting on
at, is it Cayenne Beach?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cayenne Beach, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's basically starting tomorrow and
the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony and I are judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I think we're supposed to be
speaking as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to film a little bit of the
journey from Kingston all the way to
[SPEAKER_03]: Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be about, what do you think,
three and a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Three and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three and a half hours, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe four if we stop for patties and
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, speaking of dabs, of course every
time we start an episode of Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_03]: World, what does Bubble Man do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bubble Man takes a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice little dab of some beautiful
resin here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get ready for, I'm excited today
because I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't so much like being a passenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, are you in between Kingston and
Negril?
[SPEAKER_00]: You spend most of your time in Molde or
where are you spending your time these
[SPEAKER_00]: days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually in Montevideo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage a Benham breakfast called the
Mint Retreat, M-Y-N-T Retreat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, does it run?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Monica work there?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the same place as Maurice said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I phoned, I had sent the contact info to
friends of mine that are in Jamaica right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at renting that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll put that link up so you guys
can check that place out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another place to come check out when
you're in Jamaica, in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we won't be driving,
well we'll be driving through Montego Bay,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we probably won't be stopping because
I really want to get to Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already almost one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a four hour drive, we're looking at
five o'clock and sunset's at six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, right now, this minute, we have about
an hour buffer before we miss the sunset.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably pretty likely that we're
going to miss the sunset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, but I gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to hit a dab here?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good, you're good as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm hitting another one for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to get on our way,
jump in the truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And head to Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, it's been over ten years since
I've been in Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just over ten years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I was there, I may have been
with Skunkman Sam and Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a real sort of return to one of my
favorite zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Ryan was telling me that it's
changed quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I have to admit, I never hung out on
the beach too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more of a cliffs guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always rented out on the cliffs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think we're going to head out
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching for the few dabs that
I took.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be a fun adventure,
trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heading to Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan and I got the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're driving through the streets of
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we're heading over to Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty stoked about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you feeling it, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan just had his first dab ever,
like about an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm feeling that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably still feeling that,
I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing a little left side of the
road driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess British rule, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those damn Brits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to give me directions as we
head out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to head down Hope Road here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to turn by the next
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take the next right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By Devon House.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, the Devon House.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the Devon House.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these not signals when I turn this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this not how you signal this car?
[SPEAKER_03]: Signals on this side?
[SPEAKER_03]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so not used to this car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you're carrying it again like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's automatic for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very hot day in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the Jamaicans are feeling summers on
the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: February's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're into March.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just feel that sort of colder mountain
air disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of a hotter, hotter days
throughout the, in the cities especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming on to spring, that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting into that spring weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to give you guys a
little shot here and there as we drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not going to record the whole
three and a half hour drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks for joining us on our
adventure, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is a main road that takes us to
the highway?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is Washington Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like traffic's moving a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: The boulevards, I guess, are bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a fairly new road.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more outside of the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just heading up to the toll road here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the first of two toll
highways that we'll take to get to Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is the one to Mow Bay,
correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it goes through Ochie and then Mow Bay
or does it skip Ochie?
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes through Mow Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'll be some nice footage for
people to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, this is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got cane fields on the right here and
on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you've heard the songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you continue to burn down the wheat,
we're going to burn down your cane fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the fields right there and
they're worth a lot of money because they
[SPEAKER_03]: produce cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make rum and all sorts of other
things out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's definitely a value here in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one way that ganja farmers many years
ago, anyway, sort of used to fight back a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit if their fields were taken or
burned.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going straight here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight, yeah.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hustle is on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just tell me when you're recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recording now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're just heading out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just came out of Clarendon about 10
minutes ago from Kingston and now we're
[SPEAKER_03]: heading into what everyone knows as the
Flat Bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can see the road's gotten much
tighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's huge trucks in here and there's a
lot of traffic and it seems as though
[SPEAKER_03]: right now we're in a situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a big one coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we're in a situation where it's one
lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Flat Bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show it to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little river here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Side of the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and only Flat Bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is to get us over this water.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's got the right size mangoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, you get out of Kingston and then all
of a sudden look at the mangoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we buy some mangoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that there won't be mangoes in the
grill, but those are nice mangoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love mangoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mangoes are our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Flat Bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them a little show to the right and
the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the little water there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And cars have been blown off this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it is one-way traffic, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a minute of this is real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy wants to pass the truck so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, please don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a good shot right there,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't see the river on the road and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about getting into the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a really good shot right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is just a little piece of the
action that you guys can get when you come
[SPEAKER_03]: do Bubble Man's tours.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're trying to set this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably going to start it up as a
first time sort of a rather than have it
[SPEAKER_03]: be an open tour company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it as like an initial
event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're not sure exactly when,
but there'll be a time in the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come down and I'm going to be
here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be making hash with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be taking you through ganja fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be, you know, giving you that vibe
that we portray in Bubble Man's world,
[SPEAKER_03]: what I like to call the real Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're able to remove
yourself from all-inclusive hotels and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're able to get more into accessing the
people rather than employees that are
[SPEAKER_03]: working at nice hotels, you have a much
better experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to eat local food, get to hang out
with local people, have good
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations, learn things about the
island, the people who have been living
[SPEAKER_03]: here their whole life, and then access
different parts of the culture from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafarian beliefs, the sects from
Nyabinghi to 12th tribe to Boko Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call, I think of them almost as like
wise men.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they all have different
information from their scriptures and
[SPEAKER_03]: their belief systems and they've,
you know, it's come out of hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: years of slavery with a little bit of
Christianity mixed in there and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafarian ism through the prophecy of
Marcus Garvey and the music of Bob Marley
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course the crowning of the Black
King of Ethiopia, Emperor Haley Selassie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all just pretty cool things
that you can learn about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than learning from it on Google in
my opinion and look at where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the view where you just can't
really beat the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like reggae music, you want to come
to Jamaica and hit that reggae music,
[SPEAKER_03]: trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listening to it here is so much better
than anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like cops on the side of the
road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pull over everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not really supposed to
be there because I don't think the
[SPEAKER_02]: government even owns this road.
[SPEAKER_02]: China owns this road?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those cops are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on China's road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go on the other lane, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this what we call the fast lane?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right lane is the fast lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I was figuring because the guy
behind us is going about 150 kilometers an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour flashing his lights on me like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 110 is not fast enough for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure he can show it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just on the toll highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this toll highway called?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Monique?
[SPEAKER_03]: Monique Bipass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monique Bipass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Chinese built this beast and it
cuts right up the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to show you guys around this
corner how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it just cutting right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much faster than driving right
through the hills the old way through
[SPEAKER_03]: those little roads that turn and twist.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is obviously going to be a much
faster ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we left at 2.30 today, so we'll see
what time we end up in Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than likely probably 6pm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 6.30 after sunset, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this area we're driving through?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Col Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Col Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Col Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Col Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Col Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monoherb burner, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to Jesse Royal and Richie Spice
rolling through the hills of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably about maybe 15,
10 minutes outside of Ochi.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have another 100 or so kilometers to
get to Mo Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might do that within the hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to stop real quick at
Ryan's, have a dab session, grab his suit
[SPEAKER_03]: because he hasn't been to Negril in
probably, well, not quite as long as I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been there, but four or five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to go for a swim,
as I plan on as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to that Caribbean Sea on the
west side of the island, it's hard not to
[SPEAKER_03]: jump into the water, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you in Mo Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are getting to the, what is this,
the northern part of the island?
[SPEAKER_03]: North coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: North coast here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ochi, you can see all the neighborhoods
and hotels just below these tree lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit hard because the road's
a little bit rough and Ryan's having a
[SPEAKER_03]: hell of a time holding that camera solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good effort though, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another road.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're in St. Anne Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just past Ochi, between Ochi and Mo Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oceans to the left there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caribbean Sea, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are looking for a Juicy's or a
Tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said Juicy, I saw the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to go grab a few
patties real quick here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where should I pull over, behind this
guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: First food of the day, Juicy Patty,
soya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby, I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like the vegetable ones with
Kalaloo, but they didn't have any of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got our little, they're kind of
like a samosa, the little flattened patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I often wonder if it had anything to do
with indentured slaves that came here on
[SPEAKER_03]: their own reconnaissance from India back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have brought the samosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe over time, it got flattened down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, definitely worth checking out when
you're in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it has been three hours,
three hours since we left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been on our road here and it's been
a relatively beautiful drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can see Jamaica is an utter
and complete paradise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much fauna growing everywhere,
just exotic flowers and trees and
[SPEAKER_03]: shrubberies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just obviously a pleasure to drive
through the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were getting a little bit of a bonus in
the sense that the sun's coming out now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we've had a little bit of overcast
clouds and that's been good for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That keeps it cool in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the AC on, so give thanks for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, look at that guy's flying on the
kite.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must be getting close to Mow Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just in Mow Bay waiting for Ryan to
go get his toothbrush and a few things
[SPEAKER_03]: that he wanted to bring with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we haven't had any dabs yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just realized that we should be dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I realized every car has a lighter for
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke cigarettes, but I can dab a
little dabble on top of the lighter when
[SPEAKER_03]: it pops out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can certainly take a ghetto style hoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here in Mow Bay, we're actually at the
Mint Retreat just outside of Maurice
[SPEAKER_03]: Ellis's mother's place, or at least she
works here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if she owns the place or if
she works here, but I know she's a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: it in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we might have to turn this car on
to actually get this lighter to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess there's always the potential
chance that the lighter doesn't work as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, in which case then I will not be
using this particular dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise in one hour, we're going to do
some nice smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll catch up with you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sunset looks nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're getting a good look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little rays shining up past the trees
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much don't need the shades anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've heard rumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard rumors that the police might
be shutting this event down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors are rumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to put much energy into
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just hope that this event is going
to go off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to meeting some local
gardeners, some local farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing what they produce for the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's going to be great to see
Bobby drag and the rest of the crew.
Not 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Driving through the trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this when the trees touch above the
road.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying hi to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's someone on the hill here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, sprawling golf courses beside us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you, Ryan, but I'm
really looking forward to some daven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like we haven't been daven for many
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the daven withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the town of Elgin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just rolling through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably another maybe 20 to 30
minutes away from Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just around this mountain,
but it's quite a little bit of a distance
[SPEAKER_03]: to still go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've lost our sunlight, so it's going to
get darker and darker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go straight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not in Elgin anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we at now?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in Sunday Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people out in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting darker.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called Lucy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is Lucy?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep going straight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to Lucy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's our first sign, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, first time, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time in over 10 years riding into
Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you how this feels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was daytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we would have made the sunset,
but I feel blessed to be back in Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not quite in Negril yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the sign leading us to
Negril.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you guys know when we get.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go down a nice long road
that'll be very empty on either side with
[SPEAKER_03]: just beach on the right, and then we'll
get into the hotels at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the seven mile beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see if we can't find Beach
Comber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strange feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strange for me to be staying on a
touristy beach, but our place on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cliffs fell through, and we really wanted
to get a place that was big enough that we
[SPEAKER_03]: could entertain the cannabis growers that
we're going to be meeting at the Stepping
[SPEAKER_03]: High Festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's basically why we did
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So otherwise, we would have been on the
cliffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still pretty excited to wake up tomorrow
and walk into the water on the seven mile
[SPEAKER_03]: beach where I was married in 1995,
20 years ago today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not today, but 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys, so we're heading into
Negril now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is sort of that last long stretch
that's going to take us in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water's right on the right side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's beach there as well, and we'll
start coming up pretty soon to some larger
[SPEAKER_03]: hotel structures, sandals, and all those
sort of all-inclusive places that I
[SPEAKER_03]: consider nightmares from hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're there, and we're going to go
buy them, and we might even be staying
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of in the middle of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my god, I think we're right next
to Margaritaville, which is, I'll tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you, at the end of March, when it's spring
break, that's not the place to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for a bubble man's world
experience, anyway, in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good man, I'm just driving into Negril
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your pad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots bamboo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far are you from Margaritaville?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm next door to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm going to go there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at the beach comor, and if you guys
want to come over and visit, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was 10, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just drove into Negril, and it's 710
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big oil guy, but you guys know
that my hash melts and boils like oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: 710 in Negril instead of 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have liked to have done a 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that tomorrow, but for now,
we're going to head over to the beach
[SPEAKER_03]: comor, and we are going to get down.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Kelly Castle, who I've known for
basically 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up with this kid in Winnipeg,
one of my great friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a ton of life experiences,
tripped balls together on psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_03]: gone to great concerts, and just all in
all, had a really neat experience together
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout our life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been separated from one another for
the last 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've only seen each other a few times,
but every time we see each other,
[SPEAKER_03]: we really feel that old kindred spirit of
friendship that we have and that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: always had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to introduce you guys to
Kelly and his girl, and then also my good
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy Chester, who you guys may remember
from the Amsterdam videos when I take the
[SPEAKER_03]: tuk tuks to go to the Cannabis Cup awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Chester next to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: His son Parish is in town from Ontario,
and we're going to hopefully hook up with
[SPEAKER_03]: him and get some dabs going with him as
well, so super.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so where do you think we go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks like the lobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks like the lobby right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, I guess I'll go quickly
check in and see what's going on here at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Beachcomber Hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Beachcomber on Negril
Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that, five hours?
[SPEAKER_03]: Four and a half?
[SPEAKER_03]: Four and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put our time in, and now we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't quite realize we were going to
get such an incredible room that was right
[SPEAKER_03]: at the pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all sorts of touristy people over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while they may or may not be surprised
by us hitting this mothership,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be a little bit low-key,
as we don't want to attract too much wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, after four and a
half hour drive, are we dabbing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got a call from Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come right to the end, walk right to
the pool, and you'll see us dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's my buddy Kelly
Castle, who I haven't seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are just not going to know
what this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what we got for temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: 82.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to turn it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll do two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop that dab, flip this switch,
put that back on there, and then merely
[SPEAKER_03]: wait for this number to get up to about
700 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I really love about
the D-nail is how easy and quick that it
[SPEAKER_03]: heats up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I often forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drop a dab in, and it's easy to drop it
out, as it's sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just to turn the thing on,
it's already at 150, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might not even get up to temperature
before Kelly and his girl come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm pretty excited to have them,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good old friends that I haven't seen in a
long time, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feels pretty good to be in the grill,
I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_03]: After 10 years, it's different because I
kind of despise the beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really the touristy aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always really liked the cliffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you, I do look forward to
waking up in the morning, walking straight
[SPEAKER_03]: out here, and being on the tropical seven
mile white sand beach of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sounds of the cicadas and the crickets
in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got ourselves a beautiful two
bedroom suite here with a nice big open
[SPEAKER_03]: kitchenette and living room so we can have
some of our friends over from the Stepping
[SPEAKER_03]: High Festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really hoping the rumors aren't
true, that the Stepping High Festival is
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here comes my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.
Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, we're recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recording, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are old.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my friend Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to grab a seat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just finishing up a quick little...
We just got to the grill and we're having
[SPEAKER_03]: a few dabs on the deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your guys' place?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what I expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys kind of helped me decide,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was helping these guys when they told me
they were coming to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to help them get a place or get
in touch with some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm now doing Bubble Man tours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to offer the Bubble Man vibe to
Jamaican Trini.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where if you watch the videos and you see
that kind of vibe, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that's the vibe I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I met with Nyatali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Nyatali and Brian this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nyatali's super on it, organizing all the
aspects of... He works at The Mint,
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way, the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Ronnie works there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like one of the first places,
but it's good to let me know all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different places you stay at and which
ones are top and which ones are bummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to offer a full... You know,
like one of your hostels is super cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to offer... If you want to go
baller, you want to offer that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably know where it is,
eh, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right by Ian Fleming Airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ian Fleming got us an airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the second house in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I woke up this morning in my bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see the sunrise and the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys are doing it right with
staying in a variety of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you guys really have a benefit
because you're in the center of Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You move down to Jamaica pretty much every
winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be a millionaire before
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like move to D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: and now it's like have a couple of kids
and now it's like to go to Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's C10 plus $1,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a flight to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those flights aren't $2 or $3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so four or five tickets,
$600 to $800 a piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then from Toronto I have to fly to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no Vancouver to Jamaica
flights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally is a twice as expensive trip
if you guys live in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one really big bonus of living in
the prairies and living out east.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many New Yorkers come here?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they make the tickets so cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did you make in return?
[SPEAKER_03]: It cost me $13.50.
[SPEAKER_04]: His uncle was in O.G.
[SPEAKER_04]: and he paid $200 in return.
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard she's in Ontario and anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they just don't organize life that
way, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's exactly why.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not enough people who want to get
out of Vancouver and afford to get out of
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My original dab buddy right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is hot, hot, hot every second.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never dabbed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dabbed today for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really interesting hearing his
perspective on it and how different he
[SPEAKER_03]: thought it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just kept putting his shades on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's wrong with him?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I love the way you said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a filter on his eyes or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a couple hours, Tony and Lori still
arrived.
Tony just flew in from Colorado.
He's my business partner down here.
Very cool of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy to be in the grill dabbing
with the mothership and the rasta drop
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, when y'all used to sleep on the
beach in the 90s in a tent, you'd hear the
[SPEAKER_03]: sound in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd open the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd see like 40 of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally the first time I saw them,
I thought, man, those things can fuck you
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: If all this, if they decided to all attack
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I'd be up that tree right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like spider fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is going to be cut short.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hang out with my friends,
but talk to you guys later in a bit with
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Rose.
Peace.
