[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Hash Church 2.0, episode 11.
[SPEAKER_08]: Squeezing these 2.0 shows out slowly but
surely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to thank everyone who's in the
chat room who's been holding it down for,
[SPEAKER_08]: geez, for a while now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got 70s mama in there and we got
Cuban Chronic and Robert Sellers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tame Up and Red River Organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently 128 people that have been
waiting for Hash Church to start this
[SPEAKER_08]: morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So without further ado, why don't I invite
some folks in here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if this email gets fired off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to listen for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully to see some familiars
today and maybe some unfamiliars,
[SPEAKER_08]: I have at least one person who's coming on
that's never been on before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Alex Mountjoy from the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, welcome, welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, Ron Jones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome Etienne.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I've missed you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have been busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got all sorts of things going on,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the season as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's great to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I'll tell you, it seems like it's
been forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we just had so many things sort of
line up with terrible things going on and
[SPEAKER_08]: sicknesses and busyness.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just tell us what's going on down in
Cali with Etienne.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, locally in California, we're still
dealing with the new regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Federally, we got the first VA bill or any
cannabis bill out of subcommittee ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we did it again this past week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So federally, things are definitely
changing, even with who we have in office
[SPEAKER_07]: currently.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the biggest thing, we're getting
ready for our 19th anniversary at BPG next
[SPEAKER_07]: month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: 19 years doing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that's almost how, well,
that is how old Bubble Bags is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble Bags turns 20 in March of next
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll be into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's next October.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we're the dedicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing this a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put our money where our mouth is
literally decades ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus, that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's definitely one of the first
sort of, I guess I met Debbie at least 20
[SPEAKER_08]: years ago, maybe even like 21 or 22 years
ago, right before that all sort of started
[SPEAKER_08]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_08]: But amazing how fast things go as you just
get older.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time's just passing, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just like, in the early days,
it just seemed to take very long periods
[SPEAKER_08]: of time to pass these years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's just, I seem like I blink and
a fiber has gone by.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've towed a lot of rope in these
last 20 years as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 years ago, they said it never happened
in our lifetimes, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And being neck deep in it and doing
everything that we've done, we've picked
[SPEAKER_07]: up people like Johnny B and others along
the way that have joined the cause and now
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just an unstoppable momentum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we said a few years ago, that tree's
falling in the forest and it's going,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's what happened with Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: That tree was falling and eventually it
was gonna hit the ground and that was,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're gonna, it's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, it's getting close.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like 31 days away from the
legalization here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at the grassroots conference
yesterday and talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's looking at a huge change.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Across the board.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's exciting and it's scary too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not perfect and everybody
expected perfection right out the gate
[SPEAKER_07]: from your laws and our laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course they're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people think that since we won,
we get to give up and have a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no, this is where we need
to actually be in and involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the old saying goes, if you're not
part of the discussion, if you're not at
[SPEAKER_07]: the table, then you're on the menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the best thing is to always be involved
so that you are always talking about,
[SPEAKER_07]: you may not always be on the menu,
but at the same time, you can at least
[SPEAKER_07]: help and contribute because we all have
fostered knowledge from what we've gained
[SPEAKER_07]: from doing what we've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some have gone into consultants,
others just double down and we do what we
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So proud of everybody here for what y'all
have done up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully someday we'll have some
reflection and what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_07]: United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I apologize for our stupid government
really fucking with y'all and your people
[SPEAKER_07]: up there in Canada regarding coming to the
United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're threatening to boycott people for
life from coming into the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm reading this morning that the
United States is trying to talk to Canada,
[SPEAKER_07]: but our president in charge is just being
an asset regarding everything,
[SPEAKER_07]: including Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys are our friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have taken care of us over the
years in times of need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think it's shameful how the
United States is treated you fellow
[SPEAKER_07]: Canadians especially cannabis Canadians.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely beyond shameful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome Johnny B to the old Hash Church
Room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got 362 viewers here at 9.06 AM.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some people waiting to hear
what we have to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is unfortunate that this is going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a major thing for Canadians.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what Etienne is talking about is
not just people that are smoking and
[SPEAKER_08]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even having any type of investments in
stock in companies sort of in any way
[SPEAKER_08]: connected to the cannabis industry or
cannabis as a whole, they've been
[SPEAKER_08]: threatening and they've actually been
doing it to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to blow it out of
proportions, but they have been blocking
[SPEAKER_08]: and banning people for life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that really doesn't mean you're never
allowed to go to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: again.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what that does is it denies you for a
solid six months while you apply for a
[SPEAKER_08]: waiver to get down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can be even more than six months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's, of course, up to the
discretion of Homeland Security whether
[SPEAKER_08]: they let you in at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have heard people getting banned for
a cannabis offense and then getting let
[SPEAKER_08]: back in after, you know, a six to eight
month sort of jumping through the hoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's nothing really people want to
be having to do, especially people.
[SPEAKER_08]: This really mostly affects Canadians,
only affects Canadians in the sense that
[SPEAKER_08]: if they have a company in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: and they have a company in Canada and they
have to go back and forth, if they get
[SPEAKER_08]: banned for life, you know, those people,
if they're pertinent to that company,
[SPEAKER_08]: if they need to be down there in that
company doing particular work,
[SPEAKER_08]: that really throws the whole company off
in a way that, you know, could be
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially detrimental for a company
depending on how they position themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's definitely changing the way people
look at things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome to Mike West.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Couple of peace symbols.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hear you okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of sound like you're in a tunnel
with one of those mega horns, but we can
[SPEAKER_08]: hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the only time it really skips
out is when you're far away from the
[SPEAKER_08]: microphone and then it'll do a little
skipping.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard you perfect just there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Curse of the beard, my man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Curse of the beard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the beard curse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, none of us really, really kind of
know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I have a tiny bit of stubble at
10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I see a little bit under your beard
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep a chin strap.
[SPEAKER_08]: He keeps a chin strap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to be full alopecia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, nah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have scars from some shrapnel I took,
so I kind of wear this to kind of cover up
[SPEAKER_07]: the scars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a big courthouse going on here in
Vancouver that's probably going to sum up
[SPEAKER_09]: on Monday that in regards that's basically
fighting for all of the compassionate
[SPEAKER_09]: clubs that have been serving medical
patients in Canada that are going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: forced to shut down in a sense on October
17th because there's no access.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about it yesterday and a
lot of people I'm talking with,
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of patients are quite scared of
what's happening with legalization because
[SPEAKER_09]: they won't be able to have the interaction
they've had for the last 20 years with
[SPEAKER_09]: other members.
[SPEAKER_09]: and other patients with the blood tenders
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the medical end, it's really scary
for a lot of patients because a place of
[SPEAKER_09]: access they've been going to for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the BCCS places is basically...
It's not going anywhere though.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way after October 17th the BC
Compassion Club is going out of business.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all of these places are now being
threatened with this new law.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a news article that said only
one, the BCCS said they only expected one
[SPEAKER_06]: license to be issued in BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say this, these places have
been under threat by law for all 20 years
[SPEAKER_08]: that they've existed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to understand that they are,
the BC Compassion Club is the epitome of
[SPEAKER_08]: the potential level of civil disobedience
here in the United States that has ever
[SPEAKER_08]: existed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It talks legal now, we gotta just wipe the
board clean of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the argument is very simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the civil disobedience that created
the entire medical program that we have
[SPEAKER_08]: today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're still going to require civil
disobedience until, like Etienne says,
[SPEAKER_08]: until it becomes perfect, you have to have
a seat at the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Hillary definitely has a seat at all
the tables across Canada, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: fully regulated federal, the creator of
regulations on that side, I know she sits
[SPEAKER_08]: at the table, or if it's even from the
more the street side, black market,
[SPEAKER_08]: civil disobedience, gray market.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got her foot in that world as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have faith in people like Hillary to
take it to the next level for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's part of the eternal vigilance
that we've always talked about,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, if if part of the reality is
that, you know, we've risked our freedoms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that we've seen the change in the
laws, we think we can get complacent.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here in California, with the pass of
64, we were blocked from giving away free
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had to spend the last few months
down in Sacramento lobbying Sacramento for
[SPEAKER_07]: a law and because they were going to
outlaw compassion programs at a certain
[SPEAKER_07]: point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have passed it, we've gotten it
through and now we're just waiting on the
[SPEAKER_07]: governor's signature.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's part of the reality of the long
haul and where you have to plug in
[SPEAKER_07]: yourself, you have to physically go put on
suits, physically go down to your
[SPEAKER_07]: representatives, your assembly people,
and you talk to them, you have meetings
[SPEAKER_07]: with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that hard, people, it sounds so
frightening and so intimidating,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it is so absolutely fucking simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is just to dress nice,
go down, look professional and talk to
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for some reason people have always
thought it was some sort of a crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: reality to allow us to get here,
but it's your direct plugging in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if our people in Collegere's network
and others hadn't have actually plugged in
[SPEAKER_07]: directly to California, we would be shit
out of luck still.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know that's a totally different
thing being with the state and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: dealing with the federal government.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it still takes your interactions,
your talking to your lobbying as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still affect that change to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an extent you can't now,
but there's an extent that you still can,
[SPEAKER_07]: correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've kind of been pushed in a way
with this cannabis community to the point
[SPEAKER_08]: where we were disconnected from all that
was available to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same way what you're saying,
Etienne, which is the simplicity of
[SPEAKER_08]: joining into that system and playing the
game that they play and getting at that
[SPEAKER_08]: table, it's kind of the same metaphor for
the hashish production, the processing,
[SPEAKER_08]: the growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis growers are doing it in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing it with these lights that
they've originally taken off of a hockey
[SPEAKER_08]: arena or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you sort of climb through the history
of it and you see that as we start
[SPEAKER_08]: incorporating things from the agricultural
community, it suddenly is like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, it's so much easier if we have tables
that move on rollers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, yeah, if you actually plug
in the system that's been designed to do
[SPEAKER_08]: this work already with non-cannabis
plants, you can actually accelerate
[SPEAKER_08]: yourself to a level that is beyond and
above anything that you sort of were doing
[SPEAKER_08]: in a basement with the stolen lights or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel it's sort of a metaphor for the
same sort of the bureaucracies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just always been apart from these
systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've always just had to build our own
grow rooms on spec and jerry-rig
[SPEAKER_08]: everything and MacGyver this and MacGyver
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's kind of to the point where
we've gotten to a seat at the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is so mainstream, I can't even
tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got off a flight the other day and I get
on the bus that's taking me to long-term
[SPEAKER_08]: parking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy across from me, I think he
works for Air Canada, but in fact,
[SPEAKER_08]: he's actually a broker of cannabis deals
that I've sat at at a boardroom in the
[SPEAKER_08]: last two weeks when I was in Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, hey, didn't I just sit with
you at a boardroom?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, oh my God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started talking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like, oh, I was just out talking
with Mackie Investments in Toronto to get
[SPEAKER_08]: the deal done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's talking about all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he ends up getting off the bus and
the guy next to me who's just this old
[SPEAKER_08]: dude, he's like, oh, are you in the
marijuana business?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, well, I do certification
for all the big machinery, all the CO2
[SPEAKER_08]: units and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just sitting there going like,
this is just fucking crazy at this point
[SPEAKER_08]: in time.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was like four people on the bus and
three of them were all in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry off of just a random flight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a lot easier to open this
discussion nowadays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone seems to have it on their lips.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to open up a discussion with
someone that even seems to be maybe from
[SPEAKER_08]: back in the day, they might be an
anti-cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just crack that CBD, just that word,
that term.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of a sudden it's like,
oh, are you talking about the CBDs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm interested in the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the whole term, the CBDs,
it used to make me cringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit now it makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it printed in place and it's just,
oh God, it makes me shake my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, come on people, there's only
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as you were saying though,
this change that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: people, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's taken us 20 years to get here,
but how many of us have plugged in over
[SPEAKER_07]: these 20 plus years?
[SPEAKER_07]: It took somebody like Skunkman Sam over
there 50 plus years.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been doing this to arrive at this
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Skunkman Sam's in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even see him sneak in.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on Sam?
[SPEAKER_07]: Silence it seems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And send our prayers, if you will,
positive thoughts to Forrest and Silas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently Silas has been having some
nonstop seizures for almost 10 weeks now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll send our positivity over.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to Silas and Forrest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And howdy, howdy, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just sending positivity to Forrest
and to Silas, his son.
[SPEAKER_08]: He hasn't been able to make it on Hash
Church the last few weeks because he's
[SPEAKER_08]: been in it deep with Forrest.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with Silas, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're thinking about you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome to Dr. Mark, who also snuck in
there while I was yammering away with
[SPEAKER_08]: Etienne.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got 471 viewers in the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: He might join us later here in the actual
video chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, yeah, just talking
about cannabis, all these different things
[SPEAKER_08]: that are going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B was mentioning here in Canada,
we've got about one month till October
[SPEAKER_08]: 17th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt the Liberal government is going to
push it back further.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that Johnny?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's the 16th.
[SPEAKER_09]: So legalization is over 17.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 31 days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: We know one thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there'll be one cannabis pot
shop open legally across Canada on October
[SPEAKER_09]: 17th.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't sound like any provinces or any
municipalities are ready to even pull the
[SPEAKER_09]: trigger.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think there's any government
that even has a supply chain ready for
[SPEAKER_09]: these stores, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's only 30 days in September.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I said 30 to 31 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 to 31 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: 30.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what I thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a 30 day warning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's smoke some.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 30 day warning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's better than the one minute warning
for 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: In 30 days, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, with these roadside screening
devices that now Quebec has completely
[SPEAKER_09]: said we're not going to get involved
because even temperature kind of affects
[SPEAKER_09]: these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, a lot of people are scared to
drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you post that one about the RCMP.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be taking semen samples.
[SPEAKER_08]: You realize that was a fake news story,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I posted that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Medtainer Canada posted it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's not me then.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, fake news.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a funny story.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was people were like, what the
heck?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then women were like, what are they
going to do with us?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be interesting on what's
going to happen on that end and stuff like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, hopefully officers will taking,
you know, instead of using a machine,
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll go back to the standard roadside
screening.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, you can tell someone's
intoxicated and not behind the wheel.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that hard to tell people who are
medically using or just using it just so
[SPEAKER_09]: they can actually have a better quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell that I'm intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit I'm not.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason I'm not worried about it is
because it seems as though we're heading
[SPEAKER_08]: in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, all of these like these the
worries of like, oh, the laws that are
[SPEAKER_08]: coming in are so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like who the hell is ever going to
get a 14 year sentence for for something
[SPEAKER_08]: like having an ounce of weed or passing a
joint to someone that was like a year
[SPEAKER_08]: younger than them and under the age of 18
or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just it just seems like they're fear
and scarcity laws that I can't imagine
[SPEAKER_08]: that lawyers like John Conroy and Kirk
Tussaud and all these other cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: lawyers, Jack Lloyd and Robert W.E.
[SPEAKER_08]: Laurie, they're just going to crush these
clear breaches of the Charter like they've
[SPEAKER_08]: crushed all the other clear breaches of
the Charter.
[SPEAKER_08]: The unique thing about Canada is when we
take these guys to court, we win,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a seemingly impossible task.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I swear to God, it's not that that
hard, because if you were to hear them and
[SPEAKER_08]: and John can attest because he was there
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you hear some of the things that come
out of these people's mouths that are
[SPEAKER_08]: testifying against cannabis at these
hearings, they just sound so stupid that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's not really a judge on the planet
that can't see through it completely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beyond ridiculous some of the things
that they say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they end up, you know, borderline
purging themselves, perjuring themselves
[SPEAKER_08]: to the point where it's just you can't
even take anything they say seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they end up really building the case
for us more than we build the case when we
[SPEAKER_08]: testify on our side.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, that's what happened last week
with the dispensary case.
[SPEAKER_09]: He spent all week with, obviously,
their fight against us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And John figures he can wrap it up on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because just a lot of stuff being said,
people walk out of the room and stuff like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis is a medical this accusation.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, this goes back to plugging in
and doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, I know it sounds you say it sounds
simple, but if you guys hadn't have sued
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually have done that, then nothing
would have happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just shows you one case.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it is such an integral part of
the change that is needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, more of talking to the
audience here than, you know, you awesome
[SPEAKER_07]: folks who are doing it, you know,
but it's more of just make them aware of
[SPEAKER_07]: how they can still plug in and how
important it is to plug in.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, of course, going to court isn't
cheap.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is easy, but it isn't cheap.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have lawyers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, you know, precedents,
you know, things, simple things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you can, as you say,
you know, move the discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're actually moving the line in the
sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're out there holding these people
accountable.
[SPEAKER_07]: This knowledge that we've learned is
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go out there and you have to
talk to these people directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are lying and counteracting their
arguments directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if not, if you don't do it,
who else will?
[SPEAKER_09]: The biggest thing right now is where
patients can be able to access their
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once they can, where they can be able
to medicate with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're in low income housing or
anything like that, or they're in no smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: free zones, there's no place for patients
to now go where they able to at all these
[SPEAKER_09]: clubs that have existed now for years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's another fight along the way,
and that's going to be able to be able to
[SPEAKER_09]: consume cannabis in a safe environment,
other than your home that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't going to be able to safely consume,
which is low income.
[SPEAKER_08]: I predict we will win.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we will.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will win like miles high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be like, it's, it's human
rights.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot tell someone they cannot
medicate because of their condition,
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're in a wrong place of living
where they're, they're walking,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, give me a break.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's let's, let's see what happens with
court.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, we're facing, we're facing the
same problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: The United States, you know, people don't
have access.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have to have safe access zones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, or safe access, access areas such
as just a dabbing lounge or someplace
[SPEAKER_07]: where people can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very few of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they said there's only seven in
the United States currently, and there's
[SPEAKER_07]: currently millions of users and,
you know, many legal states that just want
[SPEAKER_07]: access.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Colorado, they had to win it at the
local level in Denver and in Las Vegas,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're looking at doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a fight that is the next step
past just gaining access to the planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have to have safe access and a
harbor that we can be able to go to that
[SPEAKER_07]: we can, you know, be social, you know,
that's, it's so key.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such an integral part of this plant
that is completely lost, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, on that, on that term, I want,
or on that point, I would like to shout
[SPEAKER_08]: out the gentleman in Malaysia who's
currently facing being hung for producing
[SPEAKER_08]: and supplying cannabis oil to some
hundreds of patients that he managed to
acquire.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD oil, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's, you know, like, we've come such a
far away that, you know, on one sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: side of things, there are people like this
gentleman who's facing death, which is,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we worry about access,
but we don't have worries like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people can still practice civil
disobedience and not end up being murdered
[SPEAKER_08]: for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to shout this guy out big time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope that something gets done in
regards to human rights and that they
[SPEAKER_08]: don't end up hanging this guy for
supplying cannabis oil, because it will be
[SPEAKER_08]: a nightmare story, as it often is when
they hang people in Malaysia for being
[SPEAKER_08]: homosexual or, you know, getting caught
with drugs or all these other just
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely ridiculous, zero tolerance
policies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that leads me into also shouting out
Sarah Blythe from Vancouver, who recently
[SPEAKER_08]: had her cannabis taken from the Vancouver
PD that she was supplying to opiate
[SPEAKER_08]: addicts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a, it was for opiate addicts on
the street who could use something as an
[SPEAKER_08]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they go down there and they,
you know, sell or give cannabis away at
[SPEAKER_08]: cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't make any profits whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the PD and all of their brilliance
thought the other day it would be a good
[SPEAKER_08]: idea to go and steal that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Four storm troopers deep come in and take
the medicine off the table and walk away
[SPEAKER_08]: with it strapped with guns.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just seemed like, you know,
I haven't really seen the Vancouver PD do
[SPEAKER_08]: something that stupid in a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, they're not too, too bad when
it comes to cannabis and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: They usually just sort of turn their head
the other way, but they went right in
[SPEAKER_08]: there and took away that cannabis off the
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, while people standing in the
very vicinity were selling fentanyl,
[SPEAKER_08]: guaranteed, that's where, you know,
wherever the addicts are, that's where the
[SPEAKER_08]: opioid and fentanyl dealers are as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was just a real, you know,
Dana Larson posted about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got shared hundreds of times.
[SPEAKER_08]: The small video that Sarah made,
and I just, you know, shout out to her and
[SPEAKER_08]: the work that those guys are all doing on
the streets of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the front lines right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the front lines on the war on
drugs for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're giving away packages to patients
or anybody who's suffering from opioid
[SPEAKER_09]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're down on the east side again
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did talk about that on Cannibal
Culture News Live.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dana talked about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, they just walked in and grabbed
it and walked away and then came back and
[SPEAKER_09]: asked her, well, who's selling the
fentanyl?
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like really never seen before in
Vancouver, especially with all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: projects with Van doing and the east side
of harm reduction over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been giving away cannabis for years
and years to patients around there and
[SPEAKER_09]: people suffering.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just walked in and walked away
with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was absurd to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we saw it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We watched it over and over.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the United States this week,
a guy's mother was killed.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was being served a warrant for
marijuana arrest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mom tried to block and she was
killed by the police, shot and killed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, people are still dying for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: In North America, the stupidity is still
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to give a shout out to Michael
Kravitz and them who were doing work
[SPEAKER_07]: directly at the UN level.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have actually been working with the
UN minor councils to arrive at education
[SPEAKER_07]: for them regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And within the next year, we may see a
major change at the 1961 Convention
[SPEAKER_07]: Treaty, which has been an upholding of
these heinous laws that have caused
[SPEAKER_07]: Malaysia to continue to execute people for
something like cannabis or CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: basically, if you receive any money from
the United States government, you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a cannabis eradication program going
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the United States gives money to
practically every country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by doing so, part of that law
passed by Gabriel Nahas and them is to
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that there is a cannabis
eradication program going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that has been the main stakeholder
at the UN level that people have been
[SPEAKER_07]: utilizing to manipulate their country
situations, such as the gentleman being
[SPEAKER_07]: hung in Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, if it is changed and
removed at the UN level of which they are
[SPEAKER_07]: talking, and it looks like it could be
moving in that direction, it would strike
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be a huge change because
they are dealing with the medicalization
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis and are in discussions
regarding it because it's not only
[SPEAKER_07]: happened in the United States and Canada,
it's happened in multiple countries to the
[SPEAKER_07]: point where the UN had to take notice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are brave people down there that
are going down all the time and are really
[SPEAKER_07]: challenging people at the UN level.
[SPEAKER_07]: What effect that will have, we hope that
is positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, this is something they've been
working on for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is part of that plugging in and
being active thing that will affect
[SPEAKER_07]: change, but it's slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the UN level, it's very,
very slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the change is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are challenging the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think there's a couple of
approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple of groups that are
working on essentially a medical exemption
[SPEAKER_06]: because there are numerous countries,
UN countries have medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada, Uruguay have federal recreational
laws in the works.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the slow transition along,
usually any state or federal or UN is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to pass medical before they pass
over the counter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're seeing countries like France
also starting to change their minds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to understand that,
you know, France is basically the header
[SPEAKER_07]: for the EU.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they decide a lot of people will
go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Germany now has medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, France is going in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got, of course, the Netherlands,
which was really one of the first.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this momentum is building at not only a
local, at a country, it's now at a UN
[SPEAKER_07]: level that is very important because it
affects all the small countries as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: the big countries.
[SPEAKER_12]: Under UN regulations, medical marijuana
always has been legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was restricted, but not illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll, we'll get back into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the UN has always allowed medical
marijuana to be produced in research under
[SPEAKER_06]: the, under specific federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_06]: If every government is allowed to develop
their own programs, the US decided to go
[SPEAKER_06]: with a program where they licensed the
University of Mississippi to produce and
[SPEAKER_06]: the issue with the US is that a
combination of DEA and NIDA have to
[SPEAKER_06]: approve the Investigative New Drug
Program.
[SPEAKER_06]: That made it incredibly difficult for US
companies to actually research cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in other countries, there is some
research in both cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_06]: artificial cannabinoids, for better or
worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ultimately the UN has the ability to
change the scheduling of cannabis on an
[SPEAKER_06]: international level to treat it as a
medical product or as a non-dangerous
drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately, I think a lot of, a lot of
states are looking at treating it like
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol, but in the long term,
it's probably a safer drug than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we as humans need to treat cannabis
drugs in different ways, different
[SPEAKER_06]: schedules based on their potential harms
to society, and in all likelihood,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to see that general trend
towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a, it's a slow and steady
progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, especially if you do
when it only has these sessions once every
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of years, I believe, and this is
going to be the first time that they
[SPEAKER_06]: actually have the ability to amend the
singles treaty on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time since 1961.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's significant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shows you the generations of change,
but also the generations of oppression
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've lived under, you know,
which is beyond unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't get anything changed at
this session next year, then it could be
[SPEAKER_06]: some time before it could get changed on
an international level.
[SPEAKER_07]: That window is narrow as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the viewers need to contact their
politicians, get them, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially understanding what's going on
there, because that's, that's something
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, in order for the U S to
release some of this depression on the
[SPEAKER_06]: research of cannabis, we need to be able
to accept cannabis as medical products so
[SPEAKER_06]: that they can be researched here in the
States, as well as internationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we can also share that research and
we can also cross borders and do that
[SPEAKER_07]: research.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can combine, you know, one of the
things we need to start doing is we need a
[SPEAKER_07]: germplasm Institute here in the North and
the Americas.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we, we have things that are
acclimated over in Europe, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have, of course, seed companies,
but we have no institutes that are
[SPEAKER_07]: actually saving the germplasm,
testing it, making sure the terpene trials
[SPEAKER_07]: are proper for what this genetic is,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's unfair to the medical patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're sucessfully put out a paper that
showed that UMISS is not even capable of
[SPEAKER_06]: producing flowers that meet state
regulations for recreational grade
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or medical because it fails molds and
mildews.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it's something that the,
you know, the federal government,
[SPEAKER_06]: DEA, probably Jeff Sessions need to,
you know, start issuing the 22255 licenses
[SPEAKER_06]: that are going to open up the,
having multiple cultivators for medical
[SPEAKER_06]: research products.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to allow state licensed
cultivators across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: to start supplying research at university
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to need university
researchers and students at those
[SPEAKER_06]: universities to drive that research
forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way Jeff Sessions is going to
do anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, as much as I would love to believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's change of the building and he's
either left behind or going to have to get
[SPEAKER_06]: out of the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he'll get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, he's going to get run over by
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to happen to a lot of
these.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why about momentum is too big?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mississippi is 100% capable of producing
the highest quality medical or
[SPEAKER_12]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what they're, that's not what
they're contracted to do by the NIDA.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do what they're contracted to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the NIDA has never set these standards
for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so of course they're not meeting them
because they haven't been asked to.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying that Mississippi state
and Dr. Osole who runs it are the greatest
[SPEAKER_12]: people in the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: But to be honest, I like Dr. Osole and he
is in favor of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm all for that research and I'm glad
that they've actually increased their
[SPEAKER_06]: canopy and increased their biodiversity of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ultimately the, you know, when you
cultivate in one region in Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you're either indoor or outdoor,
but outdoors where they do significant
[SPEAKER_06]: production fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're limited on the terpenoids and
cannabinoids that are produced just based
[SPEAKER_06]: on the environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to select cultivars that can
survive in that moist and warm climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, being a more southern
latitude, it's going to be harder to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce higher levels of the rare
cannabinoids that generally prefer the
[SPEAKER_06]: redder spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know when there's been some
papers put out there that show that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, CBD strains grown at higher
latitudes produce higher CBD ratios.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that I think that being
able to have gardens from multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: different terroirs is going to be able to
produce, you know, a wider range of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid profiles that you can end up
researching more medical conditions with.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mississippi also discovered many of the
cannabinoids with their research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I feel conflict with
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the truth of it is, is that Dr. Osloly
would have gone much further.
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a patent on a GHC suppository.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, he believes in it himself
personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing against what they're doing at
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a ton of respect for Osloly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mississippi, you shouldn't have a
monopoly on the research.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're suing for that right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's working its way through the
system.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people trying to challenge that
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, you know, it takes years to
work its way through the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it took me five years to sue the
government and deal with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, change doesn't happen
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you enter the rum courts,
it's unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Longer and more expensive than you all
ever realize.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is research that's being done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone's taking a bon rep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's being legally purchased in legal
states and being brought back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: laboratory and being, and being
researched.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may not hear about it in the
scientific literature, but there is
[SPEAKER_05]: research being done on commercial cannabis
not grown in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, doctor, on your cannabis
patent this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to welcome to the room Mr.
D420K, as well as someone new who has
[SPEAKER_08]: never been with us that I've actually met
online, which is Rasta Rani is in the
[SPEAKER_08]: house as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if he's still here,
if he's frozen up, but I definitely wanted
[SPEAKER_08]: to welcome both those fellows into the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get a bon rep in, get that out
of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bon rep, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bon rep, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, D, I met someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear me, D?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can hear you when I muted myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I met someone that reminded me of you
the other day, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was this, I met him out in front of
Trev Deely.
[SPEAKER_08]: He pulled up in this just fucking savage
motorcycle chopper, grim reaper all over
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, big muscular dude just looked
like a dude that would like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: looked like a dude back in the day that I
just wouldn't have approached and been
[SPEAKER_08]: like, Hey, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I approached him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, dude, what's going on,
man?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your bike is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, Oh, thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just sort of walked away,
went inside the motorcycle shop and
[SPEAKER_08]: finished doing what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, Hey brother, tell me about your
bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I started telling him a little bit
about my bike and how it was my dad's and
[SPEAKER_08]: he ended up passing away on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I restored it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like, Oh man, that's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a great way to visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I visit with, uh, with some
people that way as well on my bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he tells me that he runs a camp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Called Camp My Way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's for, uh, soldiers and first
responders who suffer with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he takes these guys out into the
forest and he takes them canoeing and
[SPEAKER_08]: paddle boarding and fishing and just
basically camping to unplug and get away
[SPEAKER_08]: from all the sort of pressures of social
media and the pressures of society.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, he actually did a, yesterday he
did a poker run from Trev Deely to
[SPEAKER_08]: Squamish up to Whistler and back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't able to make it cause it was my
son's birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was pouring rain, but man at three
o'clock, I went out in my truck and I saw
[SPEAKER_08]: them all driving back from Whistler in the
pouring rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the guy was right up in front on his
Grim Reaper bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought, man, this guy,
his name's Terrence.
[SPEAKER_08]: He, he was telling me how he lived
homeless.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was addicted to drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He lived on the streets of Hastings,
Hastings in Maine for three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he, the guy just was totally ripped
and healthy looking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, you know, it's,
it's people like us that have to suffer
[SPEAKER_08]: and walk this road that could that can go
back and help the people that are walking
[SPEAKER_08]: in this on this road right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just like, tons of tons about
him reminded me about, about you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he just, he had a different life,
but a similar life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was just like, now he was just
like, he's like, man, I'd rather hug
[SPEAKER_08]: people than hurt people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I know exactly how you feel,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, it amazes me how you pull this stuff
out of people, complete strangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've sat in Vancouver on a, on a bench on
the side of the sidewalk and strangers
[SPEAKER_02]: have come smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy just, just these people sit
down and Mark just takes them out of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, takes them into their,
get shit out of them that just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would not be offering to people
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, and the lifestyle, you know,
with him doing that for the soldiers and
[SPEAKER_02]: man, that is such a, that is so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got so many buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to turn that, turn them onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here in my own town that I,
that I help with, you know, it's my,
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta, I gotta put this in here this
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad bought a motorcycle and he bought
himself a brand new big fucking Decker CVO
[SPEAKER_02]: and me and him and my bro chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a 6,000 kilometer ride this summer
in August up to Dawson city, then down to
[SPEAKER_02]: Rupert.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through all the smoke,
went through the good stuff, the pad,
[SPEAKER_02]: some rain, eight days.
[SPEAKER_02]: A trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did 6,000 kilometers and I had fucking
200 joints rolled up and I came home with
[SPEAKER_02]: about 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing that your dad pulled that
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said to him first, I'm like,
okay, you know, like a week before a month
[SPEAKER_02]: before I'm like, okay, if you,
if you start getting, you getting tired or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just we can pull over any time we get a
hotel in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All he goes, he goes, he goes fucking
don't worry about me kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried about you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's almost 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he fucking, he was leading us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we'd all take turns doing being in
front when he was in front, he was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: 150, 160 steady, just fucking honking on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going slower than him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did fucking great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one problem, not one hiccup,
not a sore back, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would just say to those of you out
there that don't ride motorcycles,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, riding a motorcycle for 6,000
kilometers is serious business.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is no joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could, you could, you could weed out
the week real quick on something like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I bet you you've had guys in three
days turned around and go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we've had guys that, uh,
the first night, the first leg of the trip
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with so many excuses the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got to get back to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I just like, you know, dude,
don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay if you can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'd have more respect for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you looked at me and said, fuck this,
I ain't doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of feeding me the bullshit
fucking, Oh, I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're packed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready for six days with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
Be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It don't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you a hug and fucking see you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've, we've rode in some unbelievable
conditions, monsoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ridden in the fucking mountains and
snow and you know, both feet down on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground still cruising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we thought you can't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't turn around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it, uh, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been on some rides, Mark that,
you know, Mark rides right beside,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're fucking cornering
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're riding like that, you're with
your bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely really, really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always had a connection with
motorcycles and it's, there's something
[SPEAKER_08]: about being on the big Harleys with your
bros.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like flying down the road, even with just
D four 20 K going down the sea to sky
[SPEAKER_08]: highway, going a hundred plus K,
you know, 14 to 18 inches apart from one
[SPEAKER_08]: another on the highway and just ripping
around turns us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's empowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, like for me, it's therapy,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I get anxiety every day
and I deal with all that stuff and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that getting on a bike, two gears.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got my bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: 106 this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking hot rod and it goes like
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really impressed with the motor work
done by my buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had X caliber cycles and Prince George,
a little plug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about, how about, uh, Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you guys seen this?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You holding up a green vial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this is a yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a amazing book on the evolution of
glass pipe and it's artists and it breaks
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not every great artists, but it's
quite a few of them of some of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw the ease one.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an L the ease one that was,
that was blown for our gallery show in
[SPEAKER_08]: 2003, the degenerate art show that slinger
and I threw the first glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that goes back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the earliest glass makers,
I would assume, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_12]: seventies, I, uh, was in Afghanistan in 71
and they broke a Coca-Cola bottle off and
[SPEAKER_12]: they needed to chill them out with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm sure there was grass pipes before
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I give it up to snod grass for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least in our culture, in our community,
the, the, the, the touring grateful dead
[SPEAKER_08]: fish type culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Snod grass seemed to be one of the first
promoting and popularizing color blown
[SPEAKER_08]: glass glass that changes colors and shows
different patterns as you, as you get it
[SPEAKER_08]: darker and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll have to have snod grass on one
day when we do our glass church.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more sophisticated glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just met glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he was really, he was a star.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you would basically say Bob's not
grass is the start of the American and the
[SPEAKER_07]: North American glass scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is his pipes that were going out and
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they were, they were spoke,
spoke about in hushed tones back in the
[SPEAKER_07]: early late eighties, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was seeing these pipes and they were
thousands of dollars back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, Oh, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of, you know, money people,
but they were the most amazing,
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful first of his kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course then he taught others.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now this is what it's, you know,
evolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's Scott Debbie,
you know, right there, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is, you know, mothership,
which is, you know, I heard that's
[SPEAKER_07]: changed, you know, uh, Jake is no longer
with them and, um, um, Scott's not an
[SPEAKER_07]: owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a worker there now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's trippy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things change, but the, the art and
everything, I highly recommend,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you find it on online,
but this is a pipe is an amazing book
[SPEAKER_07]: with, um, uh, great photography,
which gives, uh, just a great visual
[SPEAKER_07]: history of the current masters that are,
that are out there and available for you
[SPEAKER_07]: to go find, you know, a lot of these
shops, you know, that are popping up and
[SPEAKER_07]: around, uh, that have also changed with
glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're available.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's amazing pieces of art.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're available in practically every
city USA now, as well as in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, it's full circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, I remember going
back to the seventies, the famous steam
[SPEAKER_05]: roller, which was nothing more than a
glass tube.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pipe, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And had a little hole in the side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if I remember correctly,
that was the first time I ever smoked out
[SPEAKER_05]: of anything that was just all glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the all glass steam roller,
which I remember being quite popular and
[SPEAKER_05]: that to me led to like the one hit,
that's one hitter, but I think for
[SPEAKER_05]: designer pipes, you're absolutely right,
Bob.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember those Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You roll a toilet paper roll to do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I like to be able to throw them away
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this much about the steam
roller.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing created more dead smoke in a pipe
than the, I mean, then the steam roller,
[SPEAKER_08]: that was some like lick you so hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You fill that thing up and then take a
break and then go to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just like razor blades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be so cool that you had so
oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isopropyl alcohol just to clean it out
completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a completely clean piece of glass
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad things have changed for the
better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Needless to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we tell the story about the pipes that
you used to clean your pipe in?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's this now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your sink, your sink that you have in your
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can tell the, or should I?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude, I'll tell you, listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I did was I would, Sam is just epic
on that level.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even turn, he's just epic on
that level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I cleaned my glass barns with boiling hot
water from a saucepan that I boiled and
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Barners.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I flush it down the sink.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a sink in my bedroom because the
apartment I have actually was a hotel and
[SPEAKER_12]: they had sinks in each bedroom so that
either you could piss in them or wash your
[SPEAKER_12]: face or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was doing this for years and
after about five years or five or 10
[SPEAKER_12]: years, the sinks wouldn't drain at all
anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried sticking a router down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried different lye compounds to eat it
away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, I just gave up and didn't use it
for about a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I called the plumber and he came
and he shoved a snake down there and he
[SPEAKER_12]: says, what is all this black shit?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was dried and sort of almost
like hard and glassy that was chipping off
[SPEAKER_12]: the walls.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what was really funny was about
another five or 10 years later,
[SPEAKER_12]: he had to do it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, like the whole pipe was just almost
solid of rose.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised you didn't save it and test
it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm pretty convinced I knew what it
was.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Crapola.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you it was the highest quality
Crapola the world has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, CBN love for days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like pure cannabinoid, like
destruction, like whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Sam's hash to this day.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's ever put anything in my pipe
that's like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, it's like the first time
you smoke it, you're literally like,
[SPEAKER_08]: this must be from Mars.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from another fucking planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not of this earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: How could it be so strong?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like right away you're like,
is there like something else in here?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a bit easier to do that,
you know, a decade or more ago when there
[SPEAKER_12]: wasn't so much competition out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now lots of people are making incredibly
potent materials.
[SPEAKER_12]: The secret of mine was it was dry sift and
it was really turquoise rich, naturally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think the fact that you lived in
all the hash producing countries,
[SPEAKER_08]: collected the seeds, grew them out and
bred them, grew those and made hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a longer story to why it's
so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that without a doubt,
some of the strongest cannabis that I ever
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked was with Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I started blending and
creating my blends was because there was
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing I could find as strong hands down
that really for one hit or two hits that
[SPEAKER_07]: really put you really where you needed to
be.
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite story was a time I measured
one gram and stuck it in a glass,
[SPEAKER_12]: they call them oil pipes because you put
the oil in them and then you heat the
[SPEAKER_12]: glass from underneath and then you can
take draws on them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I did the same thing, but I put in
my dry sift, gave it to Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_12]: He took an enormous fucking hit like the
carburetor hit and then looked at me and
[SPEAKER_12]: went, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't
talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm thinking fuck, I killed Rob Clark
with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_12]: After about more than a minute of
wheezing, he finally was able to take
[SPEAKER_12]: breath.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, what had happened is he had taken
so much vapor that all of his little lung
[SPEAKER_12]: hairs got coated and they were all stuck
together and he couldn't get any fucking
[SPEAKER_12]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, yeah, you guys told me that
story and him telling the story of being
[SPEAKER_08]: on all fours while he was doing it made it
even funnier.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, unfortunately, because I'm such a
mean person, I was laughing at him the
[SPEAKER_12]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, some of that would have
made an incredible footage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you guys would have had the most
incredible reality TV show, even though it
[SPEAKER_08]: would have been ahead of its time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like to be able to watch today,
some of these things like you giving out
[SPEAKER_08]: gram those goo balls for the Queen's Day
celebration in Holland, like a gram of dry
[SPEAKER_08]: sift in one ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's a heroic dose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it wasn't even in the ball when I
gave Rob, it was completely dry sift
[SPEAKER_12]: powder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, he was smoking it,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and we heated it from underneath and
it just turned into a liquid pool and just
[SPEAKER_12]: bubbled the fuck and he didn't quite
finish it, but he tried.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about those balls,
those goo balls you used to make.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're talking about the hash cocoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: I call them goo balls.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those had a half a gram of TTC or gram of
TTC, depending on the versions.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, a lot of people would eat one or
two of them and they couldn't walk.
[SPEAKER_12]: I warned everybody really carefully before
they ate anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you want to eat three or four,
I'm good to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the woman at Breeder Steve's wedding
who told me, I'm from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll need two of those brownies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Less than an hour later, she's on a gurney
getting taken out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm flying.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what she said as we wheeled her
with her arms in the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just looking at me matter of factly and
saying, well, I'm from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, all right, like if you
want, there's a ton of bud in these
[SPEAKER_08]: brownies.
[SPEAKER_08]: But three people got sent to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam Dunn's birthday parties down by his
THC place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can remember almost every single
birthday party that I attended was handing
[SPEAKER_12]: those out.
[SPEAKER_12]: That there would be people laying in the
grass and they weren't getting up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've always said it kind of as a
joke, but I maybe think that it's not a
[SPEAKER_08]: joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could possibly give someone a high
enough dose of edibles and then like
[SPEAKER_08]: operate on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chinese used to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit puts you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen people be out for like 30 plus
hours, like using a mirror to check to see
[SPEAKER_08]: if they're still breathing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like barely, like the heartbeat slows down
so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is so slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when I had surgery, I took about
like, I think it was like 600 milligrams
[SPEAKER_09]: and they had to do with the
anesthesiologist.
[SPEAKER_09]: Had to know exactly how much weed I was
taking because I was eating a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis, as you know, before my surgery.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they had to figure out how much they
would put me under maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but damn, it was a good
surgery.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet, yeah, getting knocked out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Rastarani, how are you doing,
brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bless up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be on here with the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good guests I've always watched,
always seen since day one in a hash shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really nice to be on representing
Colorado out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, from what I know of you,
you're a cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_08]: You seem to fight for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of been a long time as
far as being in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out there since like 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with Native Roots,
had a hash company, Rastabubble for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years and, you know,
did the solvent list thing, really
[SPEAKER_00]: grinding out, trying to put that on the
map, educate people on good, conscious,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I've been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple of years have been like
ups and downs, as we've seen, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry changing here in Colorado as far
as going from, you know, from that mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop shot to more of the Walmart mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies coming and going in the
solvent list world and just a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: changes going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to still be in it and still
have a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of primarily why I wanted
to get on here and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: spread my story and show some love to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think more love is needed in
this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty vast community once you
start thinking about it and how far it
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we all play we all play a
role, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, Manuel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought of you also as a bubble
ambassador.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were always making the fire bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's when I got when I got put
on, you know, with Native Roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner of that shop at the time had you
know, when I guess when the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry started here in Colorado,
it was a lot of people that knew each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and they're all coming from the same
backgrounds, primarily of being,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trust fund kids or having a lot
of extra money or being able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and be able to afford to get
involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody really knew each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I was able to network
enough to start, you know, brushing up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the solvent list aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually looking to get out of the
industry at the time when I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with Native Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the owner came to me and he goes,
hey, man, you're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you're way too valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're way too much of a people person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all you're the Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call it Rasta bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, started up the Instagram,
put my head down for about two years and
[SPEAKER_00]: really tried to grind away at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first one of my first 11 followers
was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was huge for me because,
you know, once I checked out the page,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whoa, this is the man right
here, you know, and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a lot of clutch people around
me that helped me, you know, that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: look to to mold my my talents and my
artistry a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hats off to all those
pioneers and people that have been putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, like Mila,
Bubble Man, Nicky T, Tri-Comb Heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Dab Logic, all these people
around me locally to not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, internationally, but that had a
big influence on the direction I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: myself going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's just I'm really
blessed just to be involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really changed my life in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: My sort of mission statement in 2018 is to
bring back the full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, solventless mind is one of the
last people really just pumping the bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: bags hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still people doing it here and
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some great hash makers, as you just
mentioned, and Ken Wall and and many
[SPEAKER_08]: others.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to see it grow again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see more people making fire
water hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not, you know, I see people all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, oh, I just want to make some
nice bubble to squish for Ross.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, dude, you should want to
make some nice bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it comes out six stars.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't have to squish it for.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get that top level hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a pleasure to to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with the SIFT.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually met SIFT today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any little bit was gifted to me from a
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think here in Colorado, we're seeing
that reemergence of solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always go through our ups and downs,
you know, with what's latest and greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's trending, you know,
from rising to distill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, the vape, the vape
world seems to be taking over as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the vape pens and trying to incorporate
rosin and solventless into that world is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the new new wave of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the last couple of weeks,
I've been hearing a lot of people speak
[SPEAKER_00]: about bringing back, you know,
that good old solventless passion and
[SPEAKER_00]: using it as a staple in their shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that, but this this idea of more
organic and more clean medicine has taken
[SPEAKER_00]: hold because we talked about it years ago
that eventually the bottom is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out as we get to this Wal-Mart
mentality that the mom and pop shops that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing the real quality work and doing
real clean medicine are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: foothold and be able to stand out as long
as they put in the work to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing I'm hearing more about it
as of recent this idea and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so I kind of feel we're at the
forefront of this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of more boutique shops, you know,
the craft night versus micro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he freeze up on me?
[SPEAKER_08]: He froze up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he was out in the greenhouse or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully he comes back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Wade to the room
as well, or at least Wade's forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Wade's here listening and grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wanted to check in about
inspiration, which was your suggestion on
[SPEAKER_01]: topic today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling really inspired this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a big event yesterday here on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The International Cannabis Farmers
Association is a group of outdoor growers
[SPEAKER_01]: who are really focused on data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how it relates to regulation in the
California marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we had about, I don't know,
40 people come to the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICFA dot farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun and Earth certification is a suggested
set of guidelines for what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: appellations of origin and a certification
process, if you will, that's all about
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty thrilled to see what they've
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, that's I'll put it up on
the group chat thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be the thing to do,
Marcus, instead of trying to repeat it
[SPEAKER_01]: again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, you can put it into this chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put it into the other chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put it on the Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there it doesn't cost anything
to be a member.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're really looking for is
feedback from small farmers about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory framework in California,
at least, is working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But literally internationally,
we'd love to hear from people about if
[SPEAKER_01]: they think that the Sun and Earth
certification protocols, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: On commercial scale, I'm pretty convinced
they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a good description of
dragonfly Earth medicines practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question for you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are doing appellations.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear this all over Northern California,
especially.
[SPEAKER_12]: But most of them are growing in manmade
soils or they're digging big holes which
[SPEAKER_12]: they're filling with other soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how can you get an appellation if
you're not using the native river?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've often wondered this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more, especially when you
see appellations as the model that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: used in wine, where it has everything to
do with terroir, the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun and Earth certification does include a
terroir component.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also really focused on cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really focused on practices,
the approach that you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use to generate the amendments you
need on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, I've been doing ferments and
composts and vermiculture and harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms from spots on the property,
all about trying to create our own
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we know that cannabis,
because it's a bioaccumulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't accumulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problematic materials from things
you're bringing in from another supplier,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you were saying, Sam, if you're
buying dirt or soil, how do you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually in that soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're making it yourself... Even
more so, it's not typical terroir from
[SPEAKER_12]: that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the factors that I think is going
to be played up in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How different environmental conditions
affect different versions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain cultivars flourish in some
environments, and other cultivars do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've spoken about that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at fungus resistance,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of appellations is, like I say,
as you were saying, the native soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here in Nevada County, there's quite
a few people who work in large pots that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the ground here,
a lot of the county is old mine tailings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gold country.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the rocks got dug up and crushed 100
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are large areas of the county where
it's just vast rock fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally see them in satellites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other places where there's
incredibly rich soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We happen to be fortunate enough to have
found one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: By adding to the diversity in the soil and
into the diversity of the plants and wild
[SPEAKER_01]: insect native life of that size scale,
if you will, what I found is once you find
[SPEAKER_01]: the right cultivars, the plants flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrated pest management is a lot easier
when you've got the plants that are right
[SPEAKER_01]: for the situation you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's part of appellations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another part of appellations is the
historical culture, the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-generational history of cannabis
work in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, the local weather is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inspiring to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like it is one path forward
that allows small farmers to have a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually survive in the marketplace
that already exists here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to change the subject now because
that's a very depressing subject,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole regulated market in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the bubble bags, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gift to all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me in my life, again, if you're
talking about small farmers, if you
[SPEAKER_01]: educate yourself on how to use the bags
and what you're actually doing in that
[SPEAKER_01]: process, you can make extraordinarily high
quality end material if your beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: source material is of quality and you
handle it properly every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beautiful design, home scale,
high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty far out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a batch the other day for the first
time in a while, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was doing an online course that I'm
doing over at Gonja Talks University.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Brazilian guy that contacted me
and said, hey, the people in Brazil could
[SPEAKER_08]: really use this information, but they
really require it in Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did Portuguese subtitles for these
videos and I did three of them so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: On bubble hash and then yesterday was the
live demo for that module of the course.
[SPEAKER_08]: The course gives you the three bubble bag
videos plus the live demo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it gives you three dry sift videos
plus a live demo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it gives you three rosin videos plus
a live demo.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be the full solvent-less course
that I'm doing with Gonja Talks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday or two days ago, yeah,
was the first live demo video.
[SPEAKER_08]: I made some bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flav gave me a half pound of some
beautiful bud that turned out to be really
[SPEAKER_08]: nice, melty stuff, pretty dark,
but really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before Marcus was distributing bubble bags
and a few other folks, the truth of it was
[SPEAKER_12]: nobody had really, really, really clean
hashish.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you could buy imported hashish,
but to find it as clean as you can make it
[SPEAKER_07]: home, I wanted to get a good little bit of
a second-hand person to do some of that
kind of stuff.
I'm not gonna do it to have to separate my
hands and make the most of what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are great people out there that
know that.
And that's something to stick to.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my love to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well that's it, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have enough of a chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I agree, Sam, it was the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the sort of amazing thing to be
lucky enough to be in that position to
[SPEAKER_08]: release the bubble bags around 1999.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isolator bags had just come out in 1998.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of that year, bubble bags came
out at the start of 99.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just a unique thing to be able
to teach people how to create hash that
[SPEAKER_08]: was just the ultimate bragging rights,
so to speak, to have this quality of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just liquefying and melting and
bubbling in a way that no one had really
[SPEAKER_08]: ever seen before.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody could make dry sift at that time,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: But nobody was making it very clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I was, but very few people were
making it where it would melt and bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could easily do that with your
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and it was indeed your dry sift that
got me sort of before water hash was even
[SPEAKER_08]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in 1995.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my first cop that I was there with,
although I ended up smoking some,
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know at the time that it was your
sift, but Rob had it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it was at that old Thai food
restaurant that we used to go to,
[SPEAKER_08]: the small one that Rob would always take
people to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember hearing him on the stairs
say, if it don't bubble, it ain't worth
[SPEAKER_08]: the trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just like watching this hash bubble
and drip through the screen and drip down
[SPEAKER_08]: the downstem of the of the roar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that sat with me for a couple of
years, kind of trying to figure out,
[SPEAKER_08]: like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, how did they how did they have hash
that melted into a liquid?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, before it existed, it was kind
of an impossible thing to wrap your head
[SPEAKER_08]: around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't until seeing the isolator
bags, you know, three and a half years
[SPEAKER_08]: later, and then coming out with our own
bags and starting to see the murder that
[SPEAKER_08]: we realized, holy smokes, like this is
real, an enormous amount of friendships
[SPEAKER_08]: for me around the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I met D420k, I'm sure,
actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, yes, good old Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You moderated a little argument between me
and someone else and said, come on down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the melting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Vancouver, puff tough with me
D420k.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoked that fucking volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried that volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put some real ugly leaf in there that
was old and gave me a big bag of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, holy shit, does this ever
fucking taste good?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time I spent money
like that on something that I smoked on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like, fuck, I think back
then there were like 1,400 bucks or- I'd
[SPEAKER_08]: say it was at least 1,000 Canadian for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe 1,200.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much everyone I blazed down,
especially with that little trick,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of course I had better bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to show people the sort of
power of this little tool where you could
[SPEAKER_08]: just put something in that was seemingly
didn't look that good and just vaporize
[SPEAKER_08]: the resin off of it and get a super tasty,
tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how I sold the volcanoes out
of the store I had up here in Prince
[SPEAKER_02]: George.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a shitty bag, a Sweet Island skunk
that was in the leaf in a bag forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have a bowl with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just, oh shit, I got to buy one
of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're getting the wind in the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back Rastarani.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did just mute you because you got the
wind there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you in a greenhouse by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant actually at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying earlier, it's really
nice to get back to this emergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent lists, at least the talks of it
coming back and a real clean product for
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers and for the patients out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I based my whole
energy off of when I started with Native
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the owner was like,
hey, you're the Rastarani.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start a company called
Rasta Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my head down for like two years,
really focused on making that better,
[SPEAKER_00]: making that a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, like certain key things,
there was something that I caught YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a YouTube video of Bubble
Man at high times, getting people lifted
[SPEAKER_00]: off of his hash and like showing them the
process off of drying on the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a couple of key things that
you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them being he said,
if everybody's doing it, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stuck out for me as far as part of my
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really changed my game as far as
like my drying technique and actual end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hats off to you for the advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that type of stuff is crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the information that we share via
Hash Church and just in general is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody and all people to like be
consuming clean cannabis, I think is the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal in the long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put good medicine out for
people, not just stuff that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta, could you tell us how you do your
curing technique, your drying technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of changed, at least
evolved over some time, just with
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction of the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a seven day cure process from actual
washing to 24 hour drying on racks,
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper, then would go into a cold
room for a good walk in freezer for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: six, seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd revisit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're talking commercially,
then I would go into gram jars,
[SPEAKER_00]: glass gram jars from the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going into like a commercial
aspect, but if it's like for personal head
[SPEAKER_00]: stash or anything like that, I go into
mason jars, just small, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep dish, little mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like with the freeze dryer
commercially, that's kind of changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: game as far as, you know, rosin pressing
and being able to keep up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me myself, I put up a lot of numbers
here in Colorado as far as making hash by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really worked with a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have somebody that might gram my
hash out for me or help me do like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks, but nothing as far as the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And production of it, it's always been me
and trying to put up high scale numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing with native roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we got to one from one store to eight
stores, quality became an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause it's not just me dealing
with the product, but when it goes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud tenders and how they store it at the
shop, where it's being stored,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's being stored, all those things
come into a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, as we scale up,
it seems like quality becomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, less of an importance and
quantity becomes more of the importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reflects in the concentrates for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not something that I, you know,
typically want to go by for quality over
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, and with that said,
in the last couple of years, the dynamics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industry changing, like I said,
solventless has kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a backseat when it came to rosin and
then rosin's taken a backseat when it came
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sauces and the diamonds and,
you know, and the distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice, like I said, I've been
hearing more talks here locally amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: owners and shop owners and patients that
really want to see this reemergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: just good quality solventless hash,
regardless if it's fresh frozen or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the idea of like,
you know, a pure form concentrate is what
[SPEAKER_00]: people are leaning towards, you know,
less chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some good information right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about your dry sifting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing any static tech with that,
with the paint rollers?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been seeing that and I kind of,
I haven't tried the paint roller technique
[SPEAKER_02]: with the static tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried everything else with the static
tech, every kind of material with the
[SPEAKER_02]: static tech, but the paint roller,
I've had quite a few messages saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, try the paint roller, make a video of
it, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know, I did get a set of dry
sift screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I was working with for probably a
good six, seven months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, dry sifting is kind of like the
zen, the zen extract, as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I find myself, I can just get
caught lost up in the process alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like doing a bonsai tree for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's real meditation and to
find, you know, I'll repress through the
[SPEAKER_00]: screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once I get to the lower screen,
lower mesh screen, repress through the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as static tech, I never got an
opportunity to really try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Cuban, Cuban kind of hit me off
with like his tech, at least what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the steps of what to go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got my screens, I messaged
Cuban, Cuban hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, try this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he recommended the static as
well, but I just never got a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the game for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like it changed the whole game for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll probably get to it here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of down Harvest sub I've
relocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was with native roots, I got a job
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of one I couldn't refuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they wanted to pay my rent for a
year, moved me out to Glenwood Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked out of Aspen for about three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real culture shock for me and my
family, but a real great opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the experience to be on that side of
the state, kind of the part of Colorado I
[SPEAKER_00]: never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that said, the pulse of the
industry and what drives the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the energy that I came from,
really wasn't out in that area or that
[SPEAKER_00]: side of, side of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of brought that energy with me
out there and helped open several,
[SPEAKER_00]: several MIPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're also working in
another greenhouse that was doing organics
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've learned a lot in the last three
years, which didn't so much resolve,
[SPEAKER_00]: revolve around Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a solver list, but more on a whole
level of cannabis and, and how to function
[SPEAKER_00]: and operate within this industry and,
and be successful at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said, well spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to welcome Eric to the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see he's come in under the name Bridget,
but we're going to call him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my loaner computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys been?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fall here, summer's winding down and it's
starting to get rainy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess we'll get that for a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_08]: Until, until the snow starts falling and
then it's mountain culture all winter
[SPEAKER_08]: long, sledding, snowboarding, skiing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I took, I took our boat out of the
water yesterday and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so bittersweet to, you know,
close the summer out, pull the boat out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm like, Oh, it's time to tune
up the snowboards and get all that gear
[SPEAKER_03]: ready now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's bittersweet to say
goodbye to summer, but winter is always
[SPEAKER_03]: fun too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've been having an exciting
time lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been traveling a lot, going to lots
of different greenhouses and I got to
[SPEAKER_03]: check out the loud pack greenhouse last
week and a bunch of others in the Monterey
[SPEAKER_03]: County area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I actually finally found some
really clean grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised that Monterey area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find a lot of the cannabis plants
are covered in dust and besides other
[SPEAKER_03]: things too, but it's a real dusty area I
found.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was able to actually loud packs
one of them and there's another farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over in Salinas that I was really
impressed, like dust free, really clean
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, clean, all these good things
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of fun to finally see some
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could say out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn testing clean and Salinas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard those two things in like
a one second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how common that is,
but it's, it's definitely happening and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's far and few between, but yeah,
it was a fun trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a lot of glass greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouses, polycarbonate greenhouses,
the acrylic covers, like got to see all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm learning a lot as I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I missed Wade last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that was your house,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was busy pulling the boat out and all
that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't get a chance to come to that
meeting at the, for, for the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of, I found it last minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been meaning to call you back Wade
and talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those folks left.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little, that's why I was late
getting on church this morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, and I spoke about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fill you in next time I see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a CDFA is doing the first scoping
meeting down in Sacramento or not the
[SPEAKER_01]: first, but one of the series of scoping
meetings they're doing on Appalachians is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening Wednesday down in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to make a road trip,
get in the car and go do down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to do a heritage rally on
preservation of culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the scoping meeting from one to
four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe I can make that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but yeah, I definitely want
to catch up with you on that now that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I was talking about earlier also
was about, I was really given chops about
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble bags and what a difference they'd
made and how excessive accessible to small
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, high quality concentrates are now
as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's been that way for a long
time, but it was really one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that you could harvest trichomes and
get high purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to bubble man on the bubble bags
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's kind of the Burton of
hash bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accessible for everyone and anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten to that point that we can all
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually the same process can be done for
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what's dope about it is
that we should be all more supportive of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other, especially with people doing
good work and quality work, not so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that competition mentality, but it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strong will survive, but you got to be
supportive of those that are doing good
[SPEAKER_00]: work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the bubble ambassadors pushing the
message out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clean unadulterated cannabinoid highs.
[SPEAKER_08]: My very favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always happy when people are puffing
on the full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm extra happy when people say,
Hey, bubble man, you want to smoke some
[SPEAKER_08]: hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they pull out full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, actually, I really do want to
smoke your hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at, I was at Vans.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went into Vans the other day,
the shop with my four year old son.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm walking around in there and I hear
from across the store, this guy go bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like one of the guys that
worked there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like helping a woman with her,
like 12 year old son.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just, he's like, I'll be right
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he runs across the store to me and my
son.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, dude, I'm a huge,
huge fan of the solventless quiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love bubble hash and dry sift and rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, it was quite an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, right on, dude, I'm a huge fan
of the solventless quiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like just being able to sort of,
you know, have people recognize just from
[SPEAKER_08]: a shirt, even wearing something like this,
the 90 micron shirt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally people will see that if they're
in the know and kind of give you that sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of like, I like the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were in the airport meeting my
brother and sister, those people came up
[SPEAKER_02]: to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot when we're together too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it puts a huge smile on my face
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just nice to have like like-minded
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like being at a fish show
without being at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just like random people can come
right out of this huge crowd of people and
[SPEAKER_08]: be like, Hey, Hey, I like the foam out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You like the foam out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love the foam out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll have a puff of some foam out
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've blazed a few of those people down
too right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pretty much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happened many times.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened on my Whistler video in the
gondola.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the video, Patty and I ended
up puffing a bunch of people down that we
[SPEAKER_08]: had never met before that were,
that were excited to have a little puff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of one of the joys of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, it shows the power of
cannabis, even under the umbrella of
[SPEAKER_08]: paranoia and the umbrella of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: People were still willing to sort of you
know, have trust and have faith.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that thing, what the DEA really always
were attacking, were, was trust.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like back in the day when Howard
was doing his thing, Howard Marks,
[SPEAKER_08]: they, you know, doing things with,
with tons of material that was like on the
[SPEAKER_08]: cuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, Oh yeah, the semis at this
address just pull up, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: weigh what you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, the DEA started getting
people to rat on one another and busting
[SPEAKER_08]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just sort of disintegrated that
trust.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people have always held onto it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not necessarily to do like a five
time deal or whatnot, but to just have
[SPEAKER_08]: trust at a concert and share a joint with
someone or smoke a bowl with someone that
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's going to be one of the
powers of cannabis when cannabis becomes
[SPEAKER_08]: more legal and prohibition drops away that
we're going to see this incredible power
[SPEAKER_08]: of just being able to be like,
huh, want to, want to share.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even before you get to the concert,
I can remember driving to a Jeffery hotel
[SPEAKER_12]: concert in the sixties or late sixties.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was in Long Beach, if I remember
correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were driving from Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I noticed that the car next to us,
there was in the, on the freeway,
[SPEAKER_12]: there was three guys in their passenger
joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I waved at them because I was smoking
one.
[SPEAKER_12]: The cars got really close to each other
and we traded joints on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who these people were.
[SPEAKER_12]: I never saw them again.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were probably going to Jeffery hotel.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Passing doobies out the window at 80 K an
hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I guess you guys don't drive
kilometers down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 miles an hour, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you smiling at?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just enjoying today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking about like a,
a convertible and just a convertible would
[SPEAKER_05]: be great because you could just kind of
like toss it right into the car as it's
[SPEAKER_05]: moving, you know, not have to worry about
getting it through the window because the
[SPEAKER_05]: entire top is down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could only assume on those hot summer
days in California that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: convertibles driving around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so convertible would just make a
bigger target, throw the joint into.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not so easy to smoke the joints in a
convertible.
[SPEAKER_12]: They run.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just hard to light them, right,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's yeah, it's almost important,
but you can use a cigarette lighter for
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Mark, did I read the chat earlier that
Indra was trying to get in?
[SPEAKER_05]: That who was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Indra, our friend Indra, John Davis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he, yeah, he says he can't get into
the actual YouTube chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, he can't get into the chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't know if he was trying to get
on the panel or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he still in the penalty box?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not in the penalty box.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I just listen, I just want to make
sure that the conversation is not all
[SPEAKER_08]: about one person's product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all have things going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, you know, you guys were talking
about bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're talking about the collateral.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good to mention these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like, for me, I would love for hash
church to be nonstop bubble hat bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: talk for, for the two or three hours every
episode, but people don't want that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to just hear about bubble
hash for two or three hours every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we mentioned it here and there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could probably count on like one or two
hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many times I've mentioned my own
product on hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a question for Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of going back to that greenhouse
hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a while back when he was talking
about sexing plants by putting them in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dark for one day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had people comment on that or asked me
after Sam wanting to know what size or
[SPEAKER_03]: what stage are the plants in when you
actually do this sexing of the plants or
[SPEAKER_03]: when, when's the best time, small,
big.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the beginning, they were from seed,
but later on everybody grew a clone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was, uh, uh, the clones,
you usually know what the sex is already.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's usually seeds that, uh,
they're, they're growing and they have to
[SPEAKER_12]: be at least, uh, maybe a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, I mean, you can set some,
if you're just going to sex them and
[SPEAKER_12]: strictly only sex them, you can even do it
a bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, uh, if you're going to flower them,
then you want to have a little size to the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant before you flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's a lot of people popping
beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're planting seeds nowadays compared
to getting clones just because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole clone fiasco in California was so
such a dirty business that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the phylos came out now and has sex
testing kits also to help people that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can go, I guess, as soon as the plant,
I'm not sure which stage exactly it has to
[SPEAKER_03]: be in, but they can take a sample.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can do that as soon as, uh,
you, I think you can even use,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, uh, I'm afraid my pronunciation is
terrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the little round leaf,
even before the, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the problem with those tests is they
can tell you if the DNA is male or female,
[SPEAKER_12]: correct?
[SPEAKER_12]: But they can't tell you if it's a female
that's intersect.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you still got to do your work,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the test kits for most people are
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with the expense of the test kit,
the knowledge that you dropped that day on
[SPEAKER_03]: hash church about being able to sex the
plants and putting them in the dark for
[SPEAKER_03]: one day, uh, was huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll work really good for early fast
maturing varieties for later maturing
[SPEAKER_12]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want two or three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it got a lot of people's attention
after that one, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sex test kit is kind of expensive for
craft growers and a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_03]: popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, everybody wants to weed
everything out and figure it out as soon
[SPEAKER_12]: as the plant will just show sex.
[SPEAKER_12]: It will not continue flowering and it's
easy for breezy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think one day was enough,
but it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks later, it will declare sex and
just declare sex at the crotches.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you only do it one day like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll show up a couple of either male
or female flowers, whatever the plant is
[SPEAKER_12]: later.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it never really left the bench.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just flowered a tiny, tiny,
tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm piecing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got chores to do before my lights go off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice talking with all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it easy, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it easy, D.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to throw in a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when I was doing indoor farming,
I found, I don't know how I discovered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was part of trying to understand
photo period and how it affects cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I found that most of the different
cultivars I was working with, if I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: them a 24 hour period of darkness,
when I moved them from their growing phase
[SPEAKER_01]: to their flowering phase, I would reduce
as much as a week to 10 days off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time that it took them to finish
flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wondered if anyone else would also
wait, but it also slightly reduces yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, longer flowering gives more yield in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be that I didn't notice that
because the other practices I was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with, this was when I was on my learning
curve about how plants responded indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember learning that one fairly
early on and maybe other things
[SPEAKER_01]: contributed to the increase in yields that
I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I want to second what Eric
brought up and what you've shared with us
[SPEAKER_01]: already, that cannabis is incredibly
sensitive to photosynthesis, photo period,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long a period of darkness it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do a lot with learning about
your plants by taking cuttings of
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings and putting them in dark and
seeing what's going on with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, one of the first things we did was
we took the exact same clone and we had it
[SPEAKER_12]: being maintained under 18 or 24 hours of
light or whatever it was then.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we took identical size pots,
identical size clones, the same clone,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we flowered some of them under eight
hours or nine hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we flowered just
[SPEAKER_12]: directly from 18 to 12, whatever hours we
were using for flowering.
[SPEAKER_12]: And other ones, we brought it down
gradual.
[SPEAKER_12]: So notice, we knocked off two,
three, four minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it absolutely gives you different
form, different yields, different slight
[SPEAKER_10]: results, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that I have run into Sam and
I have a question about is that I run into
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people that are doing light
deprivation, early flowering in the
[SPEAKER_03]: summertime when it's really hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people get great buds and
great quality, and it doesn't cool down
[SPEAKER_03]: much in the evening time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people try to say that they
experience the plants being finished seven
[SPEAKER_03]: to 10 days sooner than they normally would
if they were grown indoors, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people will say,
oh, this plant flowers in 60, 70,
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a greenhouse doing light
deprivation in the middle of the summer,
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually feel like or seem that they
harvest, like I was saying, seven to 10
[SPEAKER_03]: days earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's a couple of possible
reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one is the lumens you receive from
the sun in a greenhouse are way beyond
[SPEAKER_12]: anything you're giving artificially the
plants or the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen what you're saying too,
but I can't say concretely why it wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: their case.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I strongly suspect you were just
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of a fun phenomenon,
I guess you could say, or something that
[SPEAKER_03]: occurs or happens that I hear a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if it's through testing
or people just looking at it going,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, it's done and going through that
method or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know in general, I like cooler
temperatures at night.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also like not such extreme high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_12]: I find really high temperatures have a
tendency to boil off the terpenes faster
[SPEAKER_12]: on the living plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I found through my
practices was, and I found this this
[SPEAKER_03]: summer at a farm, actually, and it was
kind of ironic to see it happening there,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that a lot of times I would put my
greenhouse where it gets four o'clock
[SPEAKER_03]: shade by a tree in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it gets full sun all day long and
then starts to go in the shade about four,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 430, maybe even earlier at
times, we would see the plants start to
[SPEAKER_03]: cool down before we pull the light depth
cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would actually, you know,
nowadays with the more advanced
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses, you can still run ventilation
and do all these things that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: do before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even for the do it yourself,
for pulling tarps, you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of ventilation when they do pull that
tarp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the minute they pull the tarp,
we're seeing less condensation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses because of the fact the plants
have a chance to cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I see it, I think helped
the quality of the cannabis quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: because of that fact that it has that
chance to cool down a little bit before we
[SPEAKER_03]: encase it in that bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when the plants are really cooking
in the greenhouse, and it's really
[SPEAKER_12]: freaking hot, their stomata's are
completely open and they're transpiring
[SPEAKER_12]: water vapor like you can't believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is not good when you close it all
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I went to a farm that actually
was asking me some questions and they had
[SPEAKER_03]: one that's at the top of the hill in the
middle of the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they had another greenhouse
that's down below.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got in the shade and the stuff in the
shade in the early afternoon had better
[SPEAKER_03]: quality than the stuff that was up in the
full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pulled the tarps at the same time
and did a lot of these things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the stuff down low got cooler quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was, you know,
one of the main reasons it was better.
[SPEAKER_12]: 25 years ago, we used to, and we still did
until recently, until I retired,
[SPEAKER_12]: we would spray our greenhouse with white,
they call it cold care.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a white paint that's water
soluble.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you spray the outside of your
greenhouse to reduce heat in the
[SPEAKER_12]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the light levels and the heat levels
are high.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it absolutely consistently produces
better canvas with no loss of yield than
[SPEAKER_12]: if you had high temperatures and way more
light.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just holding down the chat room.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reason I'm not talking right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole thing going on in the chat
room right now that I'm just sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to stay on top of.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of working away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a cord running across the top of my
laptop because it died.
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I'm sitting here, I might as
well put some clones in some dirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Working on my garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Working with you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, working away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like sifting to make my medicine for
the week and plant my plants and make sure
[SPEAKER_09]: everything's ready to go for next crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should come over here one of these
days, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some resin, but this box is all the
edibles that were entered in the Karma Cup
[SPEAKER_08]: this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to head downtown and I'll watch
that cork case with the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_09]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe when it's over before I should
come on up and say hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you do it earlier than later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I think I'm flying to Toronto
tomorrow and then onto Manitoba to maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: secure some acres of biomass for a CBD
program.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk after church and we'll make
some arrangements.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a two hour church will be in order
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice and short.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only short, it's always education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a Hindu Kush?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it's a Hindu Kush clone.
[SPEAKER_12]: That my little puppet Sammy was working
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Sammy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Sammy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sammy's getting his hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that, Ron?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone hear that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I hear it totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he coming through like a robot?
[SPEAKER_09]: Total robot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rasta robot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might need to come back in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, we're not hearing you good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did kind of hear him say, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was robotic for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wireless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wireless does suck a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So CBD, big, big companies moving into
town.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we're going to get a lot of CBD
medicine on the market here for
[SPEAKER_09]: legalization quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big part of the lab that I'm
involved with building.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to definitely do,
we're going to definitely do large scale
[SPEAKER_08]: crude oil production and distillation and
isolate for CBD and THCA.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're doing that with hand fields or with
the plastic?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all of the above, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing the robot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing the robot.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing the robot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because you're not meeting your mic
maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I sound now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because when, when, when we don't
mute our mics, it makes that robot thing
[SPEAKER_08]: even more sort of easy to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Roboto bubble man in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I was talking about, oh,
that we're going to go all the routes,
[SPEAKER_08]: have greenhouse partners, have field grown
hemp, have crude oil from, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: countries like Jamaica and Columbia be
able to get imported into Canada that we
[SPEAKER_08]: can produce isolate from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having a variety of sort of
streams makes the most sense, but we'll do
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of different ways and it's
definitely exciting to find a good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Legalization, at least, you know,
now I understand whenever you say that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's always some sour sap in the
audience that's like, this isn't
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is prohibition 2.0, but I'm not sure
those people remember having their doors
[SPEAKER_08]: kicked in and being arrested and having
their kids taken away and all that other
[SPEAKER_08]: fun stuff that happened in the days of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is definitely better.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like when alcohol prohibition ended,
it didn't end and then you could just buy
[SPEAKER_08]: alcohol on every street corner.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like slow and steady and you
couldn't even put like beer signs in your
[SPEAKER_08]: window right away or other, you know,
alcohol sold here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'm hoping that it's not going
to take as long as it did with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 to 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless if it does, we've made some
big strides in the last 10 to 20 years in
[SPEAKER_08]: this community industry, however you want
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last five years has been just
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_09]: The changes have been just amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just all, 2012, it just like
something happened and it just kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: just went like that and now we're seeing
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it all started back in the 60s,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's better that big business and
government is involved because if they're
[SPEAKER_12]: not involved, that big business and
government will hate cannabis and it'll
[SPEAKER_12]: just be illegal forever and ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not better.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's definitely not better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have this sort of argument all the time
because people are like, we don't need all
[SPEAKER_08]: these regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, I think we need some
regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we don't need all of them,
but some, it's like imagine going to a
[SPEAKER_08]: kitchen at a restaurant that doesn't have
to follow food safety, simple food safety
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those are put in place for the end
consumer safety so that you don't end up
[SPEAKER_08]: with food poisoning or eating something.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise you don't end up with kitchens.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also breed rats in the same room
for selling to people that like to eat
[SPEAKER_12]: rats.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, it's definitely a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear the argument all the time where
people are like, these legal companies are
[SPEAKER_08]: just poisoning us.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already had recalls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, listen, that means they got
caught.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's known.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other side of the coin is that nobody
ever knows because nobody ever gets caught
[SPEAKER_08]: because nobody's testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just put it into the black market
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't seem better either.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand the mentality of people
thinking like, I'm going to continue to
[SPEAKER_08]: buy from the black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I get this.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're one of those people that can
grow your own, then amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to grow your own, but it's not
realistic to think that the majority of
[SPEAKER_08]: people are going to grow their own
cannabis for their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do it because we love it and it's our
passion, but it is a substantial amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: work when it all breaks down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to think that it's as simple as do
most people grow their own tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_12]: tobacco or make their own beer and wine?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: We all know people who do, but not the
majority, not the majority.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even the people that do, do they grow
enough tomatoes for their entire year or
[SPEAKER_08]: do they eat their own tomatoes for a month
or two?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was just kind of a nice little
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they literally producing all their
food, all like 24 hours a day,
[SPEAKER_08]: 365 days a year?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's rare for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they making their own clothes?
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis has got to be available to
those that want it and need it and not
[SPEAKER_08]: just those that can grow it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love access.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be great to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we get bubble hash in the store
soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you got to start making it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm working with Whistler
Technologies now and we're producing some
[SPEAKER_08]: large scale reactors and linear actuators
for washing large amounts of water hash at
[SPEAKER_08]: a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a project I'm very excited
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a new 300 litre unit coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check us out at Whistler Tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whistler Technologies on Instagram there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm breeding new cannabis varieties where
each of the resin heads will be the size
[SPEAKER_12]: of a large grate.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the screens are just out the window.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you just like, you don't even,
you know, you could use like the largest
[SPEAKER_08]: hole screen and it's going to catch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that size, you could pick them with
a pair of tweezers.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't use tweezers.
[SPEAKER_12]: You use more like a fishing net.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they planning on doing the hemp
extraction in Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you could get one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the machine that harvests
cherries from cherry trees?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just like, it goes under and it opens
this big umbrella under the tree and then
[SPEAKER_08]: it grabs the trunk and it shakes the shit
out of the tree and all the cherries fall
[SPEAKER_08]: into this piece and go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to make those custom units for
the new cultivar that Sam's working on.
[SPEAKER_12]: A variety that when you shake the tree,
meaning cannabis tree, the trichome just
[SPEAKER_12]: breaks off immediately even in hot
temperatures and falls down into your net.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say the sift is the tastiest of
all tastes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for you guys for showing us how
to make the most epic medicine available.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can all do it at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks everyone for coming out today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call it a day here at the two
hour mark of Hash Church episode 11.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hash Church 2.0 episode 11.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of last minute once again for coming
on and making conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for Mike West who's come and gone
and thanks to Rast Rani who's come and
[SPEAKER_08]: gone and thanks to Etienne Fontaine who
has come and gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, D420K who has come and
gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of you guys, Dr. Mark,
Johnny B, Wade, Skunkman Sam and the 500
[SPEAKER_08]: people who are still viewing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you have a great Sunday and we will
see you next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye everybody.
