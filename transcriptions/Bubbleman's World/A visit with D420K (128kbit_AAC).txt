[SPEAKER_03]: Very cat-like.
Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just jinxed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a good kitty, I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cat-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: A happy day here when D420K comes through
the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to have you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to have you here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to have your ship in the house,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, D420K with the ball rig?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who set that up?
[SPEAKER_03]: High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I helped out by just introducing
you, but High Integrity Glass Art brings
[SPEAKER_03]: the motherships in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he let me know when.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did let you know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was made sure that I had a spot
to get one and fucking A, I had to jump on
[SPEAKER_01]: it no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to hit your ball rig right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to... We've got a bunch of
things we want to do actually today.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that sound?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the... Wow, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it looked like it was still in
color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit some of your gift from
many times ago.
I
[SPEAKER_03]: like all three of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have a different level of
carburation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's got a hole there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has a tiny hole right on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's got a bigger one on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should probably hit that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a little bit of Horatio 7
Star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turb City.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can let us know how you like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to be heading out for
a dinner here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be hooking up with Ro from
High Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a little Easter dinner
out at a nice restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before then, Dee and I thought we would do
a little video because we hadn't done one
[SPEAKER_03]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puff some bowls, show off the new ball
rig, and then I guess do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin because there's not enough of that
being done in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see exactly how we're doing this
properly with some really good... Dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without me doing a few tests on it because
I'm really partial about wasting any bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of my dry sift if I'm not knowing the
proper technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put too much time into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's why we'll do very... It
always looks great to do a big ball and
[SPEAKER_03]: get a good amount, but we'll do smaller
amounts and we'll just do... Exactly,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's just too valuable of a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Fresh Hettys Rosin screen,
the pressing screen, blotting screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice new clean screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably just go right into the
corner here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Create a little dish and then I guess
we'll get a little rock of this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's see what we got here.
All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, it's not too much by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twist it up real tight in the 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll turn on our little hair straightener
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to use the dabbing
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had just a little bit of rosin left over
on it from before and basically fold that
[SPEAKER_03]: over the same way you would with
parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with the parchment paper or with the
slick sheet, the oil slick sheet,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the Teflon sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: With both of those, you have to be more
careful because the heat is so much closer
[SPEAKER_03]: to direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is so thick and it absorbs up a
bunch of the heat, you actually have to
[SPEAKER_03]: give it a press for longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I do a five second press with
parchment paper, I'll easily do a 10 or a
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 second press or two seven minute
presses with this amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that we could probably and we will
probably press that out at least one more
[SPEAKER_03]: time and get another chunk of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, take your dabber and pick some
of that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to buy a hair straightener?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be in my hotel tonight doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, here, hit the egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll gladly take the smaller joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's watts there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see what Dee thinks of his
full melt OG Kush Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full melt OG Kush 99% ratio heads,
squeezed with a hair straightener into an
[SPEAKER_03]: eight star full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what I'm mostly interested in seeing
is if he gets the head rush that I first
[SPEAKER_03]: got the first few times I smoked Ross and
made with really nice sift or hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a different kind of a rip that I
got from just a normal same size rip of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what he has to say here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta photograph it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like really good honey oil from
what I used to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like a cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have that harsh piece right
here where you remember smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know this hash real well though,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it gave me a total, like I made oil
out of it, honey oil out of it or shatter
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a good buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creeps up on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just started fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, it sure is photogenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been photographing Ross in all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, it's purty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rat purty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get a couple more niceys here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the buzz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that speed you're gonna have to hit
that one like that whole, the rest of it I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things I'm used to hearing fall
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little quartz pieces?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't even worry about them so much
like on the base of my mothership and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The titanium ones I worry about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when someone puts a titanium one on
my bowl and then leaves it, I worry about
[SPEAKER_03]: it just going like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That if it touches this, you know for sure
it's gonna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I use the quartz more often than
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was the super nerve-wracker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're holding it on there for a
long point in time, it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just pure titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess I better take this rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice and tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a nice big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said to do it actually earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, brother.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was once again like almost made my
eyes want to close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really, really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool that it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty neat for sure how it's all
come along and how it's just so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people are now doing this simple little
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we gonna do another squeeze on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to show the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep my eyes off where she's a
sexy little lady that's been close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we should probably do a photo shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean them all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them up on the deck with the straight
fab, the fab egg, the Taurus, the ball
[SPEAKER_03]: rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a nice photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the calendar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poster type.
[SPEAKER_03]: The calendar last month was the piece that
High Integrity Glass Art had me post that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still no buyers as of yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a bunch of interesting parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a real treat to smoke out of,
they really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a glob out of there still.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to do a third one even.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's like half the amount that
time came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too bad whatsoever just to give you
guys the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wanna skip the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all wondering, what is it they're
looking at over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little Rosin smile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you guys the photos as well,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there it is, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry sift turned into Rosin, not too
shabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta admit, something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for the hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I noticed too is how long it
lasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I take a rip of the Rosin compared to
a rip of the bulbs at the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very long lasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolute treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much a treat, I don't wanna hit it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna hit it in my honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey bucket it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they get Nathan or whatever his
name was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He posted it on for sale, 2600.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said they have a timer on their.
[SPEAKER_02]: On their quartz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what you're hitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Longer leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would leave it longer for this type of
product, which is an oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like say if you were hitting dry sift
or full melt, I would hit it within 10
[SPEAKER_03]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 to 45 seconds if it's an oil,
like a Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really within 10 seconds I'll drop it
on there if it's full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or dry sift or wet wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super stoked on this whole process coming
out and being popularized.
[SPEAKER_03]: A way to make shitty hash a great hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: A way for me to access a dab out of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I just wanted to photograph that last
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love the oil slick pad for doing the
Rosin technique on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'll use parchment or Teflon
sheet again to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just comes off the easiest I've seen
from the oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way it insulates the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows me to really press with more
pressure and more heat than I would
[SPEAKER_03]: normally be able to do with just parchment
or the slick sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I think that's it for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go eat some delicious food
and continue on puffing our brains out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pleasure to have a D420K come
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pleasure to be here brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure we're going to be seeing you
again sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer time's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to the springs here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be riding my bike down blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta get the bikes insured and I'll be
joining in on a lot of that fun too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for watching Bubble Man's
World and we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
Peace.
