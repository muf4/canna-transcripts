[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for smoking pot 9-inch colas
Pedro Robles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for coming in Dude,

[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever smelt it dealt it and I say
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey right on your sounds not on that's
pretty much what I saw There's no sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we'll turn your fucking sound on
my god
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaylee that was in Negril Where we
recorded that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Omar you want to hit some full
melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, man
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times a day do you rip Well as
often as I can I'm not gonna lie ripping
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really affect me the way it
affects a lot of the people that I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: with I Don't really get destroyed Well
sticks the way you get a legends shirt as
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to legends You don't get a legend
shirts if you don't go to legends and each
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt is unique and different to the
legends that you Would go to and so of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I could make a ton of cash selling
legends shirts people ask me for them all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time But I think the really cool thing
about legends is that if you don't go You
[SPEAKER_00]: just you don't get to represent you have
to go to represent oh Dude last Sunday's
[SPEAKER_00]: hash church was my favorite my top
favorite it made me realize that nobody on
[SPEAKER_00]: The panel is the most important that hash
church is bigger than all of us and that
[SPEAKER_00]: we proved it by all of us leaving the
Panel and having a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: panel Natasha did a pretty incredible job
along with Hillary in moderating and
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing and setting up all those women
They straight owned hash church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you I'm not sure if they knew
how well they were doing the whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know some of the women were a little
uncomfortable that they don't normally
[SPEAKER_00]: talk in a in that sort of Setting but Well
my thoughts on that DJ 3000 who asked I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to know your thoughts on CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe in full plant extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to get locked up in one's own
belief systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think it's a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea Regardless of whether
it's gonna be a good idea for me I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's gonna be a good idea for someone
monomolecular medicines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes can be made into very accurate
recipes that can be recreated time and
[SPEAKER_00]: time again and for people who suffer from
Crohn's and from the Parkinson's and from
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of epilepsy particularly
neurological problems they require
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes very specific ratios that need
to be very very accurate and When we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sometimes variables can change
something can change from one crop to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next and you can actually Change your
terpene profile just enough that you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably would not see the same effects
for that patient now, so for me I Want
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we have I just because I
don't use monomolecular medicine doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that I wouldn't fight for it and I
would certainly say the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: against it why not Spend your time and
your energy maybe doing something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more positive like fighting for what
you want that you don't have Rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting against something people do have
and that they do want we've got to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting for what's already there I mean
for real That's my opinion and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a great question and I was happy to
answer it Made me feel like another bong
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie The bong wrap terp dips
are just so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna go in for some lemon
tree this time The
[SPEAKER_00]: new pen was designed to work with terp
sauce That's not to say it won't work with
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of other things,
but we designed the new pen to work with a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene infused Rosin like distillate,
which is not a distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't use any chemical petrochemical
solvents I think that you guys will see
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen is gonna be very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we've been working on it for almost a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know This shirt I think this
shirt is like 25 bucks it's a an
[SPEAKER_00]: embroidery so it's a it's a hard patch You
can get them up at bubble bag calm Exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was soft So all these people have
been doing these eight Distillate pens and
[SPEAKER_00]: they put in fruit terpenes or whatever
Gold drop put in the Blue River terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were crushing it So it was really
in through inspiration from gold drop and
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Gary who owns Omicron that
maybe we should create our own pen I told
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony I can't put my name on just any pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't do it I don't like the idea
of people buying pens and throwing them
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so fucking wasteful So we started
talking about eight months ago and started
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing the idea of potentially
creating a reusable pen a pen that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: refillable and A pen that has no wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: No solder.
[SPEAKER_00]: No insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No motherboards near the element that can
That can heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's listen We may learn that the pen
can be improved even even better but trust
[SPEAKER_00]: that Tony and myself and Gary has spent
eight months designing and creating and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with this pen so that we could
feel good about putting the bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: brand and the Blue River brand terpene
name on that pen as well as all my Omicron
[SPEAKER_00]: because I mean he does really high-end
work I wouldn't want him to put his brand
[SPEAKER_00]: name on anything that was less than the
best so That's what we're trying for we
[SPEAKER_00]: should have them by August 1st and for
those of you that are wondering yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are selling them filled up with rosin
and terpenes that'll be in the California
[SPEAKER_00]: market Tony has a new Company that he's
working with that is a delivery service
[SPEAKER_00]: called Anki delivery and That's going to
be delivering those pens all over,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely gonna be bringing the
pens to Jamaica I'm hoping on getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pens up in Canada once the legal mechanism
exists for that and We'll try to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: into as many states as we can for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on Cali keep in mind the
pens for us was like It's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble box.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen is very much like the bubble box I
want to turn people on to how to enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: these extracts with terpenes and without
in a way that is next-level And so if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get them the best pen possible that
leads them into a dabbing experience
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what the pen is like It's
like hitting a really nice dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so unbelievably tasty You can't
believe it and the bubble box was a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar thing I was sending selling the
bubble box to people who are joint smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was trying to teach them about
making hash So they'd be breaking up their
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and rolling their joints over this
little screen I tell them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know after many joints lift up the
screen card through this first screen To
[SPEAKER_00]: this to the bottom and then card for a
while and suddenly people who were just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking joints We're getting full melt dry
sift the holy grail of extracts There's
[SPEAKER_00]: many paths down this road of extraction
and trust me They're exciting each and
[SPEAKER_00]: every one of them But the end of the path
is perfectly grown micro encapsulated
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome resin heads Isolated to
near perfection 99.9 percent heads Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how it's the holy grail Ask
anyone if they have it next time you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis event and there's like hundreds
of people in the audience And if you're up
[SPEAKER_00]: on stage say hey Could you please put your
hand up if you have full melt dry sift?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might see a couple of hands go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it at the Cannabis Cup years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone will have oil Everyone will have
oil boxes and boxes of oil very few people
[SPEAKER_00]: although much more than in the Past will
have full melt bubble hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe maybe a dozen maybe two dozen but
full melt dry sift You'll be very very
[SPEAKER_00]: very surprised that just not many people
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that Often that you see it 99.9
percent heads It's that 99 Duncan up on me
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff was just both of these were not
really what I would call now these are
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9 percent heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, both growers didn't really hit
the mark and so they were kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: What does full melt actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, nine-inch Cola's a long time ago in
about 2000 maybe I was at the Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was hanging out with skunk man Sam
and we were smoking on his full melt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know clear dome dry sift and We were
smoking on it on a screen on a very tight
[SPEAKER_00]: tight stainless steel screen in his little
pipe and I'd be like Yeah, when it's when
[SPEAKER_00]: it when it melts like water I call it full
melt and then Sam says yeah and when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really really high quality Not only will
it melt like water, but it'll bubble up
[SPEAKER_00]: these big giant clear domes and I'm like,
yeah That's the full melt clear dome and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's literally the moment that we coined
the phrase FM CD as well as full melt and
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as clear dome both all three
different kind of Titles if you will so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where those Titles came to be
That's right Connor Jay because very few
[SPEAKER_00]: people have it and when you have it,
you're a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Cuban He has it rock star,
you know, suddenly that shit disappears
[SPEAKER_00]: less of a rock star It's the big it's a
big deal to have full melt dry sift not
[SPEAKER_00]: many people have it and it's one of the
things that bubble man brand is Absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be bringing you in California in
the very near future already been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to some people about sift that they have
to clean and Well, Mackie Chloe grow
[SPEAKER_00]: something I believe was his name that one
he I asked who took the picture of me in
[SPEAKER_00]: the avatar which was me smelling the buds
in Jamaica and he said Johnny B and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: you won and so he won So let's have
another rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did zero one two, three four five
six seven eight nine nine eight seven six
[SPEAKER_00]: five four three two one zero Nice
palindrome name by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really sets the tone
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to say it depends on how much we pay
for the pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just really you know,
we're not trying to destroy people We're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sell the for the lowest price
possible
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm hitting the sapphire aqua every
time I'm at home I'm hitting the sapphire
[SPEAKER_00]: it unless I'm torching and then obviously
I'm hitting the courts
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Yes, grow Tacoma we do use local
retail partners ID ideally people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have licensing in place that are already
growing or have the processing and want to
[SPEAKER_00]: You know bring in our brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can come in with the SOP and some
people train up Make sure that the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: is on point because I just we just can't
put the brand name on just any quality
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy, so yeah, that's about it We're
definitely looking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't clean the sapphire the
sapphire just gets A q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put staff DC glass cleaner on
sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll crack sapphire can't change heat
that fast All right Let's make golden dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift and it was full melt 99% dry sift and
I got it from a whole bunch of super
[SPEAKER_00]: strong bed with tons of track I'm so dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hell around it through a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go a Lot of times people think
it's 99% but if you look at it under a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope 99% is really hard to get this
is a abracadab Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite hot Let me hold up the
other one Because I do have another one
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it together for you This is the
one most people like like even more than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one Flower of life
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not necessarily trim and I'll will
bring in people and potentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's SOP so depending on the
company and the professionality and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's worthwhile to sign contracts
and Get that information the SOP and the
[SPEAKER_00]: know-how is very well protected with sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would probably send someone to do that
job Someone could come in and do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: five to ten kilos in a couple of
afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, I do I have my I have both my
rosin presses if you see there's one right
[SPEAKER_00]: here There's a Sasquatch and there's the
v2 Sasquatch with a bunch of extra plates
[SPEAKER_00]: on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my My air compressor The DeWalt
there's my Pedro smiley lamp Sweet sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go true full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well, maybe one more hit we've got
262 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm we're usually around 200 I'd love to
get this up to 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get it up and beyond but It is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Thank you whoever just said that about
that I Don't know I'm not health Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have to ask them those it's the
government Listen if you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: that attitude with the government You
should do this send in your application
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you get it within a year You should
do a backflip that way and when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back in like four or five or six months
You'll be so happy because it'll be way
[SPEAKER_00]: less than a year But if you expect it in
four or five or six months, I bet you it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the worst They're like the only
people worse at communicating than the
[SPEAKER_00]: government are telecommunication companies
so like Verizon and AT&T and Virgin and
[SPEAKER_00]: Fido and Rogers and fucking tell us those
companies are literally the worst at
[SPEAKER_00]: Communicating which is amazing when you
think about it because they are a
[SPEAKER_00]: telecommunications company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a weird irony, I think Yeah,
that's that's how that's how you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: melty heads puff with the maids Like that
John Manx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Thanks Brett Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support I'm the real
health, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I'd give everyone licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd let everyone be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very inclusive if you haven't already
noticed They might be 9-inch colas call my
[SPEAKER_00]: 1-800 number at 1-866 melting Okay,
where can I send you some hat pins for
[SPEAKER_00]: that hat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some hat pins I have this one from
nerd And I have I thought I had a schwack
[SPEAKER_00]: of pins in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I have this Illuminati one from
From the D nail crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a lot of pins and each time

[SPEAKER_00]: I got true Kana from my bro true And then
there's Schroder hitting the D nail I got
[SPEAKER_00]: the OCD labs I Thought I even had oh,
yeah, I even got one that someone made
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags If I had more of these I'd
give them away, but I gave them all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a cool giveaway You can send a pin
to P. O box four seven four P. O box four
[SPEAKER_00]: seven four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just type it into the thing for you
four seven four lions baby see V o n 2 e
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boom, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send that shit Send that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have two of those Illuminati pins
still and I'll have to see if I do I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give one away one of these days Well,
I like living water more than dead water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for sure my good friend Mitch has
been turning me on to that I got turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: very very long time ago Yeah pharmacy you
said you were sending a box a while ago
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely I always go to the P. O box
because I know I hate To forget so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: say you're sending something, let me know
and I won't tell you know Just randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: not go to my P. O box for ten days
Everything was straight trikes now when
[SPEAKER_00]: you say straight trikes, are you talking
about the entire trichome or Just the
[SPEAKER_00]: heads or were the little stocks in there
to Alonzo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what most people don't
understand is the entire trichome is not
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the heads are active It's dry stiffed
with stocks in it is very easy to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it's We call it farmers grade but getting
the stocks out is like the most impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: like most difficult Really really really
difficult thing and the word the part the
[SPEAKER_00]: the word is in the in the photos You know
when you see really beautiful Perfectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know isolated glandular trichome
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah dawn 710 heads like heads like dry
trichome heads You know see those little
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of heads there Good evening Andrew to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning and good afternoon to
everyone Else I think that covers it all
[SPEAKER_00]: it is the Holy Grail 100% Yeah,
I mean it's just farmers grade Lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people show me sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks gold to the naked eye and when
you don't know you don't know and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Yeah, 150 160 180 200 140.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all farmers grade John We only care
about the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct And here's the thing when
you separate out the the trichomes as
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy was saying and it's all gold and
there's no herb You know no green in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine, but that's not we're not even
close to done yet Now you have heads in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio to stocks that is almost like the
ratio of trichomes that you had to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter So you have to clean it twice you
get the sift off the bud But then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the sift you think you've done a
concentrate you haven't you've done a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers grade isolation What you really
need to do now is you need to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that 80%?
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant that is non glandular Okay,
it's the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the systolic hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's non glandular material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not glandular trichome heads so What
do you say in there Shelley Simpson?
[SPEAKER_00]: I give good what I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love any grade well Lester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Personally it's not even a grade though
glandular trichome stocks is not a grade
[SPEAKER_00]: if you isolate them out from heads And you
try to dab them you will not have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect Other than like you just dabbed
cellulose or paper Well MD 73 I get blonde
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and you get blonde hash from washing
bud stem because those glands seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: just the the lightest and and Freshest
color ever they I've always gotten near
[SPEAKER_00]: white when it comes from the stock even
the same stocks that have come from a An
[SPEAKER_00]: older crop that went a week and a half
past due and had very amber Heads still
[SPEAKER_00]: white on the stock, so there's definitely
something to be said for the the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: hash I've made bubble with just stock you
can do it, too You will literally get
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what that gentleman just said the
whitest hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite neat Well it does take a while
dirt you got to put your time in you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to put your time in You got to put your
time in I don't smoke BHO Anything I was
[SPEAKER_00]: at a friend's house the other day What did
he he's like hey you want some of the he
[SPEAKER_00]: had his his distillate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That he was all and he's he's getting some
some some trichome some resin that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be putting on it But I'm just like I
don't care about it at all I will try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a picture of it though, so you can
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had quite a bit of it This is his
distillate some of it was very clear They
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing their thing with it,
but I just it has You know once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't fight against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad people have access to it,
but it's not for me I'm not excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about smoking really
beautifully grown cultivars with beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: Extractions you know of all sorts from dry
sifted obviously dry sifting is a huge one
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't have a footprint You
don't have a footprint when you dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: You know That's important Distillate is
what you do with bad material It's what a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are doing for sure It made
the outdoor cannabis community here very
[SPEAKER_00]: happy because everyone just takes their
outdoor that wasn't selling I didn't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt mansion actually and They're just
you know turning it into To to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, which is great the world
needs more connect cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's just not my I'm not
interested in focusing on that I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit Different of an agenda for the
for the community that I want to what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to release And so that's the beauty
of the spice of life we all get to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want to choose So yeah,
you know for me survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean not just solvents, but like the
petrochemical base solvent So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really who I'm trying to skip out on the
best that I can but it's near impossible I
[SPEAKER_00]: still put it in my dirt bike and in my You
know sled and in my truck and in my boat
[SPEAKER_00]: and in my van and in my car Am I gonna do
hopefully I'll go electric one day Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good sell that you have that access
to be able to take it and get to sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty darn important you and Amelia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Amelia and Tara laughing at Tara's
always saying funny shit Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Scaldone's not really a dumbass
he's actually very intelligent and has a
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Know where he was coming from but at the
same time I know exactly where Sam was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful thing about information is
you know, it's it's about like Sheldon is
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing information that he knows to be
true Sam is saying listen whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: true or not We don't really want to be you
know, like well Sam doesn't really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be but what Sam has to understand is
because he has a very strong belief system
[SPEAKER_00]: that There's the other side of the coin of
the people who will still continue to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit in the industry Regardless of
whether it's been cleaned or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can clean it there is
absolutely no argument that that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's Better than if they can't I mean
they're Already selling it people are
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaling poison dude all day long all day
long So I got to what I understand I was
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sam's side of the fence But as I
realized hash church is so much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than us and our little opinions and I look
at the Information and I see well it was
[SPEAKER_00]: you know shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have said it either but That's
why hash church is a panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why hash church has a bunch of
different people so that someone will say
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know Oh You're welcome Tara Lee,
I don't know if it was a shout out But how
[SPEAKER_00]: about this now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shouting out and I'm shouting out
people that asked me to shout them out on
[SPEAKER_00]: their birthday My god, there was a guy who
said it was his birthday and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: his birthday today And I definitely have
to spend a few seconds just going through
[SPEAKER_00]: my inbox here to see which guy this was
We've got to wish him a happy birthday
[SPEAKER_00]: What a shitty thing for me to forget about
if I already missed it and I apologize,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope Here we go Hey be man,

get home every day and it's literally the
[SPEAKER_00]: best part of my day.

[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have a rip and let's fucking have a

[SPEAKER_00]: All right What an easy thing to do if we

[SPEAKER_00]: few minutes talking about him And
celebrating his birthday for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at work right now.

[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be pretty stoked when he gets

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I didn't forget it is Tuesday and

[SPEAKER_00]: David.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your commitment to the
show and This rip my friend is with you
[SPEAKER_00]: Did Kenny threaten you what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck who said that that was weird
Anyway, let's have this rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we let's do it
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday rips Oh birthday rips That was
some sweet skunk dipped into some lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: tree I Will I will chalice chugger we will
give him a pin We'll give him an are you
[SPEAKER_00]: elite pin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving two pins away today and I'm
gonna send David a email and say David You
[SPEAKER_00]: get a pen you get a pin not a pen a pin
and let's thank Whoever it was that says
[SPEAKER_00]: chalice chugger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can thank chalice chugger David
because He's the one that said we should
[SPEAKER_00]: send you a pin and I agree if I'm gonna
give chilling like a villain something for
[SPEAKER_00]: finding an ant on my egg, then I Think
we'll be we'll be giving you a pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's right proper
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean Joseph Lewis who the fuck is
seeing a higher trichome count and how are
[SPEAKER_00]: they doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they counting their trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I photograph many many different cannabis
plants and I can tell you that trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: density trichome growth Changes all over
the plant It's ever-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's constantly trichomes growing at
new times and and maturing at different
[SPEAKER_00]: rates You could you could measure the
cannabinoids and the terpene content to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if you're getting more But having
a higher concentration of heads won't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily give you that if the wax
membrane is so thick and you have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: very small amount of the goods inside So
it really depends on how well you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think turpinator Personally,
I don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I would tell people to
buy I'm not trying to call out the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it, but I did go to Ramo's
I did visit his grow when he was using it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just felt like saying Ramo like all
your shit was is amazing like this
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinator does not look any better than
the one next to it that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinator like it's just beautiful you're
a beautiful grower so Ramo can throw any
[SPEAKER_00]: product into his grow and as long as it
doesn't kill or affect his shit negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: that those companies are stoked because
Ramo's a really good grower obviously he
[SPEAKER_00]: based His food on that I haven't used his
food as I was staying in a more organic
[SPEAKER_00]: line Although I heard recently he did
announce that his line was vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure about that I'm sure it's
true if he's saying it a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_00]: know are growing with it and having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more interested in brews teas compost
The soil balance Pro that Peter's been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real interest in learning about
those bacteria It's interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ramo is damn straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he he knows what he's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah Yeah, you just can't get one size
head Although I will tell you that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are size heads in plants that if you
separate them all out by their different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes You will have a favorite Well,
I think they're already kind of like these
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit turps and you know false turps as as
I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow Well, I think Indra's full of shit if
he's saying shit like that And if he's
[SPEAKER_00]: saying shit that I said I can tell you for
sure Indra might be losing his mind I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not too sure why he would say that on his
live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the reasons You know
Todd left was Indra was getting more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more negative and negative and really the
last few episodes He was on the only
[SPEAKER_00]: reason he was being nicer is because I had
to tell him listen Dude, like if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw him when he first started his
Instagram account, it got bad fast I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: he went from being this really cool
spiritual old guy with amazing stories To
[SPEAKER_00]: very very negative and nasty fast and so
I'm not too sure what's going on in his
[SPEAKER_00]: head I'm sure he's feeling a little Upset
as he's you know in this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with Todd, but I wouldn't fan
the flames Indra I think you should drop
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I definitely think you should keep
my name out of your mouth when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about things that I said because
that That just doesn't sound Sound right
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad, you know I like Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I he has this Dichotomy where he's
just this he's he he tells these amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stories He's all spiritual and then all of
a sudden on this other side He's socially
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoning and he's saying things that are
really nasty and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna spend too much time on it
But it's definitely true that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: see a little bit less of Indra In hash
church, I mean, you know, I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see that I even in hash church
He'll hold it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys asking him all the questions
about his machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really would wish you didn't I wish you
would ask him that stuff in private and
[SPEAKER_00]: not make it all about that while he's in
this chat room so now I've said my piece
[SPEAKER_00]: and It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are still baked and I hope
you guys are iry Well Todd has his own
[SPEAKER_00]: show Kayleigh and it's a pretty awesome
show you can check it out on his channel
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't I think Todd will be coming
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a growth for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growth for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll see Indra on his show in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, last rip of the day and
here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd's channel is Talking With Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave a couple of pins away, celebrated
David's birthday, and puffed some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, guys, thanks so much for coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful day and may the full melt
bless your bowl sooner than later.
