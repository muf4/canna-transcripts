[SPEAKER_01]: We're ready for fourth one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live on Facebook with this character,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, well, I guess we should maybe
wait a second or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One?
[SPEAKER_00]: For an audience to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we wait for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, we're building an
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you're live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's six.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thirteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well we can do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Jared Scully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Aaron Waite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi sir, in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven Simon's in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xavier Delmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Bubble Man Del?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bedridge is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a whole crew of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott Conerton first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite, but first in first fifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gotta count for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam High's with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I have been pressing up a storm
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to the, to the spot recently and
got these different flavors and we pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: up, uh, well we pressed up the Gorilla
Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pressed up the Cooks 09,
the burner cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pressed up the Teflon, which is the
cherry pie crossed with the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, wasn't it the Wi-Fi, uh, 43?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the squished pieces that,
uh, that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Maggie Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squishin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squishin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a few pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to do a 420 rip, it is now 417,
but really it's almost 418.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, we have two minutes to get
your dabs ready for the 420 celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for my, well I'm looking for
the carb cap and the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was grabbing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh here, this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one that works perfect,
especially if you're hitting that little
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently I'm hitting the baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's nothing wrong with the baby
cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are pretty clear, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the Teflon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these have been quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't hit the Teflon yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then let's hit Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scratch it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wish I could remember what mine was
cause I squished something today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't the Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit the Teflon with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teflon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Teflon Dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Cal Chang in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joroboam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iree is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane Freyborg pressing some MK Ultra
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we got a few people in the room right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one minute and counting away from
our 420 celebration here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a one minute warning?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll literally be able to torch
that up in 10 seconds and it will only
[SPEAKER_00]: stay cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get cool in like five to 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put my face right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hitting, uh, I'm hitting this
little guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major, but a nice, a nice 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice 420 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's Sandra Colasanti.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tanya Schoenwolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 18 seconds till this 420
celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenneth Amin Haynes is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: With his chalice live and direct from
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to not be alone smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked that we are all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little extra of my dab
by taking half my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 420 everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great 420 dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a nice 420 dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, you know, the baby Kates may be
small, but I certainly don't think of it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a secondary piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it hits like a champion right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the little baby Kates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually hitting it quite a bit the
last few nights over all my pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a really, really, um, busy week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Friday now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what is everyone doing for the
Friday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ja, yes, Ja, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ja made enough for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you feel like you're in the fear
and scarcity and you feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not enough for you, that you're
not getting enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely remember Ja made enough for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting, sitting down to press my
first ice wax dabs of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to catch you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Lee hit some 420 bowls with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure not everyone is on the West coast
celebrating in the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of you may be in the 730 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the earlier, even later,
but Hey, we celebrate nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our 420 and we're happy to
celebrate it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Hutchinson is in the house while
Johnny B and myself sit here and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kind of wind down a nice, nice day of
Johnny B came by with a, a, a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a, well, three quarters of herbs that we
purchased at the, um, Sunrise Wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watched it on the show the other
day, welcome Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I free Bueller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anyway, he brought them by.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept two grams out of each one and
pressed the rest and got quite a lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: return about a 20% return on his 12,
uh, 12 grams that he pressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got almost three grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very nice return for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Teflon, which is the cherry
pie crossed with the wifi 43, the O nine
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, which is the burner cut and the,
um, gorilla cookies, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh man, that one is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you that's pretty much how
this is lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is lined up the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what you got going on here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a really nice squish.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, I always love the squish and
this was like, uh, I wanted some nice
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about my kid's art over your
shoulders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone appreciating my kid's art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pretty amazing art.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's like, you can tell,
you can tell he's advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are dabberrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see that you guys come in and
share your vibes with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this Facebook live, you know,
getting a little notification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, so and so just went live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, might as well go see what those guys
are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, shit, they're probably hitting
Jamaican Terps, Jamaican Terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a four 20 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we exchange pipes and we do just
like a four 24 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost four 24 and four 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest is a palindrome and we
should always celebrate palindromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if those of you that are
unfamiliar with the palindrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out bail a flex album, UFO,
tofu, UFO, tofu, being a palindrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it's the same forward as it is
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also fish did a song called the divided
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure it's the equivalent of
a musical palindrome in the sense that all
[SPEAKER_00]: the music is the reverse halfway through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's have that four 24 dab Johnny
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hit some D four 20 K or do
you want to hit some fresh press?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the Teflon, which one's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying all three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit the gorilla cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit your second press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are special dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are special dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Johnny B's birthday dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you out there in internet
land, I will have you know that my good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Johnny B tomorrow.

[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Monday, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's Monday.

[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free right now to hit him up with
a happy birthday because this this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B birthday.

[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fantastic weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be around on Monday, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got, of course, a surprise birthday
party last Friday, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I showed up here to get some
squishes so I can have some superior rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: for the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really, really good fine flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorites.

[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the rosin photos that I took
of Johnny B.'s rosin today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm coughing to right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fine resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little tease for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of some of what went down earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we'll get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why I got to open up my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, because the last time that
last video, I was like, hey, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Eric.

come to his place and photograph his
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some good times, I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you're under the quiver right
now, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm under the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're under the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pumpkin is under the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all representing myself,
Johnny B., the pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Stevie Hughes in the house.

[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Traffic got bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out here to just basically have a
meeting and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm not the only one that has
beautiful framed trichome shots that sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on my table, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have pictures of trichomes and
frames around your house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.

[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're getting dabbed up,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: That last dab, we ought to say,
felt pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, I mean, that's like some of
the amazing flavors that are coming off of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Sasquatch is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw, I had to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quite, quite nice from flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was in flowers less than an
hour ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are hitting the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hate to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should post that in Hash Church so
more people can have a shot at answering
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the happy birthdays,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm seeing it and you know,
this guy is getting old now, so he needs
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why don't we say goodbye to them and
thank them for coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll I don't know what we're going to do
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill, puff more bowls, maybe squash more
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you guys are on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like more confident already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like really like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of a little bit on the brink
there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, but I just kind of I don't
think he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like Abbott and Costello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on first on what's on third?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's nothing wrong with Abbott
and Costello.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a compliment right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up and I used to watch Abbott and
Costello and think those guys were as
[SPEAKER_00]: funny as funny could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always loved watching Abbott and
Costello movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abbott and Costello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B and Bubble Man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder which one's which.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marciana Mia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She spoke to the ministers in Manitoba,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in church, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'll be in church this
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Church skipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's going to be
internet for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently there might not be internet
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, did you want to take all that acid
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm taking it with me for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's what you meant by taking the
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
