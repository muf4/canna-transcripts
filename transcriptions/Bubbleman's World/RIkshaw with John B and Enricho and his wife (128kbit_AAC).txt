[SPEAKER_01]: So, John, where are we, bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the back of a rickshaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a lighter for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking I might have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yes, we are in the back of the
rickshaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Amsterdam, we're in Dam Square
right now, and we are just heading over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is sometimes a nice way to travel
when you're in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always have to take a cab,
you don't always have to get your own
[SPEAKER_01]: bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's nice to, yeah, you can
puff-toff.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's puffing it up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great birthday day, I'm enjoying
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't get any better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Enrico!
[SPEAKER_00]: Enrico!
[SPEAKER_01]: Our good friend Enrico, the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hey, woo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, Enrico!
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Enrico's making his own YouTube
video, so we just caught a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I feel that this is better than a
cab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm puffing, I'm enjoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I wanted to do on my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like this, exactly, stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, yeah, this is what I
wanted to do.
Hello!
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old Amsterdam, heading over to
Soma's.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we'll be at Soma's soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to smoke some bubble,
maybe get sublimating on some amnesia
[SPEAKER_01]: haze, and we'll catch a clip when we're
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a great time!
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to hear Enrico in the
background, doing his video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, awesome, good fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a nice set.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Hotel Europa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fancy place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming around into the flower market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, we've got to come back next time and
get a bong in here, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next rickshaw will involve a bong,
some bee line, and a lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some full mouth, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty much here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just opened up good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's coming up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight, I think it's ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, right here, right here,
right here, stop!
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop!
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, but we're not going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to the apartment behind you,
on this side, right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome!
[SPEAKER_01]: High five!
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to the apartment behind you.
