[SPEAKER_12]: the cloud and then we're going to go live
what does that sound oh that's my phone
[SPEAKER_12]: that is my zoom telling me that it's time
to go live that's funny live on youtube
[SPEAKER_12]: might throw the old air pods in as well
[SPEAKER_12]: getting ready here all right i'm gonna put
my camera on as well sweetie if you want
[SPEAKER_12]: to bounce i know you don't like to be on
camera what's that okay well then you can
[SPEAKER_12]: stay right where you are look at that
you're only half on told you my wife is
[SPEAKER_12]: shy all right here we go let's go live
[SPEAKER_12]: meeting is now streaming live on youtube
all right i just have to share the link
[SPEAKER_12]: hey welcome everybody to hash church 3.0
episode 18 almost an impromptu episode it
[SPEAKER_12]: came together pretty quickly i just need
to share the new youtube chat with the old
[SPEAKER_12]: one because for whatever reason the way
zoom is working these days that's the way
[SPEAKER_12]: they make us do it so there we are we're
good we're live we've got a crew of people
[SPEAKER_12]: want to welcome everyone today i'm very
excited about today's episode very much so
[SPEAKER_12]: inspired by seger international's panel of
wonderful wonderful cannabis aficionados
[SPEAKER_12]: and cannabis warriors if you will uh dr
mark lewis who's in the room right now
[SPEAKER_12]: from napro uh you know i'm gonna let him
do his introduction because i could spend
[SPEAKER_12]: the next hour introducing him first met in
leiden in holland at the international
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid research society and i think
it was ryan lee my good friend chimera
[SPEAKER_12]: genetics who linked us up and that was
great ryan lee is hopefully going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: popping in as well today alec from sc labs
is going to be here i also invited ian
[SPEAKER_12]: davidson from segura hopefully he's going
to be able to make it he's very busy on
[SPEAKER_12]: sunday so it's not always possible for him
we've got wade in the room we've got skunk
[SPEAKER_12]: man sam we've got peter coming in from uh
soil balance we've got colin palmer coming
[SPEAKER_12]: in from vessel life uh and i'm probably
forgetting a few people oh mojave richmond
[SPEAKER_12]: is also coming in i did also invite rob
clark i'm not sure if he's going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: able to make it or not but wow what an
incredible group of people and then joe
[SPEAKER_12]: sullivan as well which will get you to
introduce yourself as well a good friend
[SPEAKER_12]: of alec from sc labs when i told him about
the show we were having he uh he said hey
[SPEAKER_12]: we got to get uh we got to get my buddy in
there as well so welcome all of you guys i
[SPEAKER_12]: hope you're having a great day i see dr
mark sheldon is also in the room how could
[SPEAKER_12]: i tell you guys tan is in the room these
are our our regular panelists that are
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be joining us as well today so
some some regulars and a bunch of new
[SPEAKER_12]: people so well i think we would love to
start maybe with you uh dr mark lewis if
[SPEAKER_12]: you want to give a little introduction to
yourself to the hash church community that
[SPEAKER_09]: would be uh that would be amazing sure
thanks marcus longtime listener first time
[SPEAKER_09]: caller um like to give a shout out to
david and etienne haven't seen you in a
[SPEAKER_09]: while um i think i met etienne the same
time i met you marcus um yeah i i grew up
[SPEAKER_09]: in indiana uh went to iu bloomington and
discovered kind bud started growing when i
[SPEAKER_09]: got dr dre's chronic album been playing
with cannabis and getting uh technical
[SPEAKER_09]: something science degrees to support that
effort ever since started napro research
[SPEAKER_09]: about five years after being in california
uh and started um developing methods to
[SPEAKER_09]: elucidate the chemical constituents that
are in the plant and use that methods
[SPEAKER_09]: those methods to create a marker assisted
breeding program that um that we're really
[SPEAKER_09]: proud of multiple clients use our
technologies we service clients we don't
[SPEAKER_09]: actually cultivate cannabis so if you know
any growers who are struggling and they
[SPEAKER_09]: want some help that's kind of what we do
uh we also recently licensed our
[SPEAKER_09]: proprietary phytofax to sc laboratories
since we've been terpene focused for about
[SPEAKER_09]: a decade um that technology is really
helping the uh cultivation community with
[SPEAKER_09]: quality control standards learning how to
fill holes in menus and really helping
[SPEAKER_12]: consumers make purchase decisions so
awesome thanks dude that's awesome amazing
[SPEAKER_12]: um i'm really looking forward to the
conversation we're going to get into here
[SPEAKER_12]: today the for those of you that didn't see
the segra panel that had dr mark lewis on
[SPEAKER_12]: it uh it had mojave richmond and rob clark
from bio agronomics it had uh ryan lee
[SPEAKER_12]: from chimera genetics and it was on
seger's website today on their youtube and
[SPEAKER_12]: i couldn't find it uh but i will find the
link and i will put it into here because i
[SPEAKER_12]: think it's a really good sort of prequel
uh to the conversation that will
[SPEAKER_12]: potentially happen today uh here on hash
church i want to welcome ryan lee aka
[SPEAKER_12]: chimera genetics to the room how you doing
brother not bad yeah that link is not
[SPEAKER_11]: public on youtube yet um they're still
doing it as like a registration through
[SPEAKER_11]: the seger website so i'll just send you
the link but if you want to watch it in
[SPEAKER_11]: the next week you have to uh fill out your
info or some fake info so that people can
[SPEAKER_11]: can get out and watch it but it'll be up
on youtube in a week i'm told okay cool
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah i'll see if i can get uh possible
permission to post it on my channel as
[SPEAKER_12]: well uh once they've gotten past trying to
whatever they're doing with acquiring uh
[SPEAKER_12]: you know contacts and whatnot with it but
uh yeah it was a great yeah yeah it was
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting it's funny there's a whole
group of people that kind of freaked out
[SPEAKER_11]: about thinking something that isn't it's
just not to be surprised in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: industry but uh yeah i mean it's just
talking about basic breeding it's nothing
[SPEAKER_11]: too in depth or um i don't know
conspiratorial minded it's funny when you
[SPEAKER_11]: start talking about cannabis breeding in
the post-philos world everybody thinks
[SPEAKER_11]: it's all about big companies coming in to
steal your shit and that i don't think
[SPEAKER_11]: they realize that you know i mean there's
500 licensed companies in canada that are
[SPEAKER_11]: operating um so there's like yeah there
are some big growers but in case anybody
[SPEAKER_11]: hasn't been paying attention they're
failing big time in the marketplace and a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of the smaller cultivators that you
know have a smaller footprint and put a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot more care into their flowers are
starting to do sales and do do a decent
[SPEAKER_11]: amount of sales and you know maybe they're
not multi-billion dollar businesses but
[SPEAKER_11]: they're successful cultivators providing
flowers to the market a lot of these
[SPEAKER_11]: people are transitions from the legacy
marketplace so i don't know i just the the
[SPEAKER_11]: whole conspiracy thing is is kind of funny
but i was a bit disappointed by it i will
[SPEAKER_12]: be honest when you said uh that sam had
posted uh on ic mag i was like oh i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: gonna go check it out and see what people
are saying and i i was kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: disappointed to see the sort of low brow
level of of kind i was just like oh man
[SPEAKER_12]: this must be why i don't really post on
the boards anymore like which is hard for
[SPEAKER_12]: me to say because those boards and i don't
turn my back on those boards easily they
[SPEAKER_12]: were everything to us you know like when
when the cannabis cup only existed in
[SPEAKER_12]: amsterdam and the only boards were
overgrow and cannabis world and you know
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis stuff like these these boards
were everything to us they were the
[SPEAKER_12]: community we didn't have all the social
media we were segregated onto these
[SPEAKER_12]: smaller little platforms and they really
were everything and when i look back at it
[SPEAKER_12]: now i i mean i went into the ic mag chat
yesterday just to kind of try and like
[SPEAKER_12]: even see what everyone was up to in there
and it just seems like it's really
[SPEAKER_12]: stagnant it's it's like i guess we left
those boards and we started sharing this
[SPEAKER_12]: information everywhere else almost but
those boards thank god for you sam because
[SPEAKER_12]: you're still on there sharing uh valid
information do you find that there's still
[SPEAKER_12]: decent dialogue to be found on the board
sam
[SPEAKER_12]: sam paging skunk man sam he's like out of
the room maybe well we'll welcome uh jerry
[SPEAKER_12]: jeremy plumb to the room good to see you
in person oh you there sam yes it was my
[SPEAKER_07]: mute it i was muted i'm self-muted myself
how many bong rips in the day are you
[SPEAKER_12]: right now just out of curiosity what what
is that now i said how many bong rips into
[SPEAKER_07]: your day are you currently oh i know
exactly i counted on my uh iphone uh it's
[SPEAKER_12]: 792 that's impressive so yeah about the
boards though do you find that there's
[SPEAKER_12]: quality conversation and dialogue
happening on these on these well let's say
[SPEAKER_07]: that there's a handful or two handfuls of
individuals who are capable of discussing
[SPEAKER_07]: it without you know sinking down to
aluminum hats and they're not all on this
[SPEAKER_07]: podcast right now uh no because uh there's
a few i know who are quite nice people and
[SPEAKER_07]: privately message me saying they
appreciate what i'm doing but whatever i
[SPEAKER_07]: mean if you're really interested check out
the uh bibliography that i have posted
[SPEAKER_07]: that's maybe the most interesting thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that's all
[SPEAKER_12]: you're muted marcus we can't hear you sir
yeah sorry guys i'm just talking to myself
[SPEAKER_12]: i wanted to welcome jeremy plumb to the
room this is a gentleman that for some
[SPEAKER_12]: reason i just did not know in the industry
like our paths have not crossed in the
[SPEAKER_12]: last few days since the segra panel
catching him on clubhouse uh and listening
[SPEAKER_12]: to him speak uh so absolutely passionately
and eloquently i think i'm not the only
[SPEAKER_12]: one that shares that sort of perspective
it's absolutely a joy and a pleasure to
[SPEAKER_12]: have you here on hash church jeremy thank
you for showing up and honored to be with
[SPEAKER_08]: you marcus uh really excited to see the
crew and i remember one day in the
[SPEAKER_08]: netherlands where we ended up at sam's and
had a few bong rips and sam helped me to
[SPEAKER_08]: understand the error of my ways and that
the open cannabis project was a fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: terrible bomb about ready to detonate i
think he was one of the first people who
[SPEAKER_08]: said you know with absolutely no minced
words that that was not going to work in
[SPEAKER_08]: any sort of way shape or form just
appreciating that moment when we were
[SPEAKER_08]: together in the netherlands anyways so
great to be here really really a joy to
[SPEAKER_08]: connect on clubhouse too seeing some like
amazing dialogue and really really the
[SPEAKER_08]: level of depth and conversation that just
keeps it going keeps it growing it's funny
[SPEAKER_11]: you know i think i have pictures of of all
of us together outside that restaurant in
[SPEAKER_11]: Amsterdam so i'm amazed that you guys
didn't cross paths before then i think i
[SPEAKER_11]: did too ryan yeah yeah that's pretty
amusing jeremy's good shit he's uh been a
[SPEAKER_11]: good friend for the last few years i don't
know when we crossed paths jeremy i think
[SPEAKER_11]: it was 2013 or 2014 when you were speaking
at the emerald cup on terpenes with mark
[SPEAKER_11]: um but yeah jeremy for those don't know he
runs proof cultivation or does the
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivation and data analytics i guess
well why don't you tell us what you're
[SPEAKER_11]: doing a proof i'm gonna let you put it in
your own words jeremy because it's some
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty impressive stuff down at proof man
thank you ryan i i admit i i just know
[SPEAKER_08]: that uh to have this time with you guys
actually like means a lot i haven't been
[SPEAKER_08]: on social media in two years until the
last 24 hours and just kind of went
[SPEAKER_08]: underground because primarily proof has
been the total focus i really gave
[SPEAKER_08]: everything like every minute of every day
for the last four years pretty much to
[SPEAKER_08]: turn the ship i took over this uh high
tech sort of indoor controlled environment
[SPEAKER_08]: facility about four and a half years ago
and it's been quite a ride when i started
[SPEAKER_08]: there was a huge amount of technology
trials in partnership with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: different uh university folks that have
like dave holly from fluence and presented
[SPEAKER_08]: some data on far red wavelength at the
cannabis science conference a couple years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago we've done incredible agronomy i think
right now i'm in this huge wormhole of
[SPEAKER_08]: balancing minerals and really
understanding sort of nutrition by diverse
[SPEAKER_08]: variety at a level that completely
surpasses anything that i've experienced
[SPEAKER_08]: in the past being able to respond to some
of the erratic and interesting things that
[SPEAKER_08]: show up but you know we're entirely
organic crop production but also just
[SPEAKER_08]: excited to see the constantly booming
yield by virtue of pursuing the data to
[SPEAKER_08]: the nth degree one of the coolest parts
was i actually worked with a team from
[SPEAKER_08]: colorado that does a lot of data science
and analytics we built a custom platform
[SPEAKER_08]: called proof os that essentially was an
environmental control system with a bunch
[SPEAKER_08]: of extra features to bring in phenotyping
capabilities back in the day i actually
[SPEAKER_08]: did do some phenotyping partnership with
phylos but then that all of course went to
[SPEAKER_08]: shit so there's a bunch of other partners
that i've worked with to do basic stuff we
[SPEAKER_08]: don't have any kind of genetic science per
se happening other than what we're doing
[SPEAKER_08]: with cultivar discovery we've had some
great seed sifts gone through about
[SPEAKER_08]: populations of thousand seeds and had all
kinds of exciting sort of really unique
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties come out i've of course been
working on my own hybrids for a long time
[SPEAKER_08]: but at proof i've been able to actually
grow many of them out and see some really
[SPEAKER_08]: exciting things like this dog walker
strawberry malawi cut that actually has
[SPEAKER_08]: the recessive pining expression and it's
getting like six percent total oil of all
[SPEAKER_08]: alpha and beta pining i've found an array
of other really exciting type ones but
[SPEAKER_08]: been principally focused on type two
hybrids i have a plant called astral works
[SPEAKER_08]: that i bred years ago it's won a bunch of
gold medals actually one of the sweet
[SPEAKER_08]: spots i'll just share this this was a
cross section of my life where in october
[SPEAKER_08]: i won a gold medal at the cultivation
classic which was an event that i founded
[SPEAKER_08]: five years ago with congressman blumenauer
it's become the largest craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: event in oregon and of course ryan you
came and blessed us and many others have
[SPEAKER_08]: joined over the years but uh pandemic has
fucked all that up but anyways it was
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing to kind of close the gap on the
supply chain where astral works the plant
[SPEAKER_08]: that i bred won the gold medal in the type
two category at the event that i'd started
[SPEAKER_08]: which then was grown in the facility i
direct and then sold at the retail i
[SPEAKER_08]: founded called pharma and it was like each
one of these things to me are weird in
[SPEAKER_08]: their own way you know they're distinct
from the other versions of those things
[SPEAKER_08]: happening elsewhere and i'm just trying to
in my own way build a small narrative
[SPEAKER_08]: about some of the themes that i've learned
from you and a lot of other people here
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly mark and just uh sam and marcus
and they're trying to build this kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: different version of the supply chain
while i'm watching you know all the
[SPEAKER_08]: capitalists crashing going around in the
market down here of course everybody's
[SPEAKER_08]: going fucking crazy now with federal
regulatory reform around the corner and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's lots of like stupid money coming
in again after a pretty big deficit four
[SPEAKER_08]: years ago we didn't understand what would
happen with the supply glut we expected it
[SPEAKER_08]: but then had to ride through that and it's
been an incredible effort and efficiency
[SPEAKER_08]: and being pragmatic but also pursuing as
much research as i can so some really
[SPEAKER_08]: exciting things in a controlled
environment there and would love to get to
[SPEAKER_08]: share more about some of the strategies
i've uncovered that have really helped to
[SPEAKER_08]: evoke some of the most expressive chemo
bars and just really thrilled about what's
[SPEAKER_08]: going on but i've also finished my
employment contract and now i'm engaged
[SPEAKER_08]: with a number of different producers
internationally i have a partnership in
[SPEAKER_08]: new zealand that i'm really excited about
because they're doing shit differently
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a malory-owned company there
called rua bioscience ethan and i were
[SPEAKER_08]: there in january or february right as the
pandemic was hitting and i'm really
[SPEAKER_08]: excited about what they're doing they have
a different sort of ethical spine than
[SPEAKER_08]: what you typically see here it's a it's a
little it's pretty inspiring but anyways
[SPEAKER_08]: that's some of the stuff there's also
actually one other thing i should mention
[SPEAKER_08]: ryan there's a cool new advisory board
role i've just started i don't know if
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody's heard of dr barry bilek barry is
an md from colorado who for 50 years has
[SPEAKER_08]: been going between nepal and colorado and
in nepal at catmandu university he's
[SPEAKER_08]: brought together a team that i think will
probably over time ambition to include
[SPEAKER_08]: many of you it's called the
multi-dimensional cannabis research center
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're building this really cool
international collaboration near center of
[SPEAKER_08]: origin just have some great vision about
how he's approaching that and really
[SPEAKER_08]: including like you know everything in the
kitchen sink and the kind of research and
[SPEAKER_08]: approach they're doing i'm hoping you know
post-vaccine getting out there in october
[SPEAKER_08]: getting to check up on them but that's
another neat thing that's just been
[SPEAKER_08]: bubbling anyways just fucking great to get
to be together with family on a sunday
[SPEAKER_08]: with a lot of bulls to look forward to and
ideas to share shout out to nepal um shout
[SPEAKER_12]: out to mark rose and jute and the whole
nepali family who have been making and
[SPEAKER_12]: producing bubble bags uh almost since day
one my wife sewed up the first ones and
[SPEAKER_12]: we've had them made in catmandu ever since
so that's awesome to hear that that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going down in catmandu and mike rose
actually recently got in touch with us
[SPEAKER_06]: which is really exciting because he has a
beautiful piece of property outside of
[SPEAKER_06]: catmandu that he wants to completely and
fully convert to regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: in nepal he's already burying logs on
contour in the hillside fully ready to
[SPEAKER_06]: sink and recharge the land with water and
build the microbiology for those very
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely rare cultivars that can show up
in nepal at times big up to mark rose i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to express deep gratitude to uh
jeremy plumb for uh hitting on type 2
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis thank you thank you thank you
thank you because i really think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the magic and healing is why don't
we get into a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_12]: conversation the different types of
cannabis you know just for i mean
[SPEAKER_12]: obviously you guys are all at the highest
caliber but it would be nice for some of
[SPEAKER_12]: the listeners to say hey what what does he
what did he mean by type 2 cannabis i
[SPEAKER_09]: could probably take a stab at that marcus
we uh love that we we were we've been in
[SPEAKER_09]: type twos for a long time they're they're
tasty um but what's cool is you type 1
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis is most of us are aware as high
thc cannabis was previously defined as
[SPEAKER_09]: having both two btbt alleles the thca
synthase genes um type 3 cannabis is
[SPEAKER_09]: essentially your hemp um mostly cbd or not
containing thc as we are learning that
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp is defined by an arbitrary metric of
less than 0.3 thca and not much else um
[SPEAKER_09]: and type 2 cannabis arises when you breed
a type 1 parental with a type 3 parental
[SPEAKER_09]: and you get some sort of mixture of thc
and cbd in the flower um and i think one
[SPEAKER_09]: of our really good favorite people
molecular farms they started really
[SPEAKER_09]: focused on creating parental lines in the
type 1 world and the type 3 world i.e.
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp and thc only plants ryan helped lay
the foundations for that breeding program
[SPEAKER_09]: and what's really cool is they created
parentals of type 3 hemp that have all of
[SPEAKER_09]: the noses that are commercially favorable
and even some other noses that you know
[SPEAKER_09]: don't exist in the marketplace you know
that they have a hemp line well
[SPEAKER_09]: technically it's not hemp because it will
it will go hot have approximately 0.6 thca
[SPEAKER_09]: but it smells exactly like og kush so if
you take that type 1 that smells like og
[SPEAKER_09]: kush and the type 3 that smells exactly
like og kush and you hybridize them they
[SPEAKER_09]: will create a homozygous seed line that
has a nose that's og kush and then a thca
[SPEAKER_09]: to cbda ratio that will vary depending on
the parental um certain parentals will
[SPEAKER_09]: yield in the most common and most dominant
uh parentals yield seeds with one to two
[SPEAKER_09]: thc to cbd so it'd be a cbd dominant plant
but then there are other parentals that
[SPEAKER_09]: yield one to one and others yet that yield
two to one and four to one and so forth
[SPEAKER_09]: and some are mixed chemo type as they
breed out like uh you know you'll have a a
[SPEAKER_09]: scatter of them and similarly if you take
a type 2 plant and you cross it with
[SPEAKER_09]: another type 2 plant you'll get type 1 2
and 3 back out in that f1 population
[SPEAKER_09]: because it segregates so as blessing may
be when they passed the farm bill uh we
[SPEAKER_09]: had groups sitting on parentals of type 3
hemp that has all the beautiful noses and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're still being hoarded because the
first two lines they let out were
[SPEAKER_09]: legendary og and jack's blend and heavenly
pepper there are three and there wasn't
[SPEAKER_09]: any real hemp with terpenoline dominant
noses in it prior to that in the very next
[SPEAKER_09]: year of course everybody had terpenoline
dominant so some of these more exotic
[SPEAKER_09]: noses they're hoarding until there's a way
to create or find a group of farmers who
[SPEAKER_09]: want to exclusively grow these you know
exotic pineapple hems and all this
[SPEAKER_09]: different stuff but uh it's really cool
the way that that you can create those
[SPEAKER_12]: parental lines thanks for sharing i was
wondering maybe ryan if you could get into
[SPEAKER_12]: a little bit about what mark was referring
to when he said you laid some of that
[SPEAKER_11]: groundwork i was one of the first
employees at napros so i was kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: brought in to set up the breeding programs
really um yeah so i mean we just we just
[SPEAKER_11]: you know we the group down there had a
bunch of affiliations with dispensaries
[SPEAKER_11]: and the idea was to get some novel
medicines for these dispensaries and so um
[SPEAKER_11]: through like a really big kind of market
survey using a really sophisticated
[SPEAKER_11]: laboratory that we built we were able to
to see what chemotypes existed in the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace right essentially it was just
a you're just running thousands of samples
[SPEAKER_11]: through the lab and cataloging all the
terpene profiles and the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: profiles and in doing so when you're
starting to organize the data you realize
[SPEAKER_11]: that there's grouping as if again mark can
talk more about that um it's kind of he's
[SPEAKER_09]: been i want to talk about all the hugs you
had to give me because of the freaking
[SPEAKER_09]: girl scout cookies vaporizer incidents
where you know the panic attack came in
[SPEAKER_09]: and i was like man i wish we had a girl
scout cookies type two so i wouldn't feel
[SPEAKER_11]: this way yeah yeah well i mean i don't
know it's a different crowd here i mean i
[SPEAKER_11]: think most of the hash churches are
probably like pretty heavy type one
[SPEAKER_11]: dabbers so you know dabbing the the plants
that are you know 25 to 30 plus thc acid
[SPEAKER_11]: percentage um and in certain people that
can induce anxiety when you hit it if you
[SPEAKER_11]: take a big dab and we're rocking the
volcano back in the day uh down at the
[SPEAKER_11]: farm or one of the farms and um maria mark
would have these like anxiety moments or
[SPEAKER_11]: you'd have a big dab and would freak out
but what's going on i don't think it was
[SPEAKER_11]: only the thc i mean you had a pretty high
pressure life at that point in time a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: was on the line but um like i think your
body changes over time too because in
[SPEAKER_09]: college you know i'd get hot i'd get
rosted before every practice and every
[SPEAKER_09]: football game i get high all before tests
and everything wouldn't have a problem
[SPEAKER_09]: with high thc and then it's like i don't
know get a little older a little wiser got
[SPEAKER_09]: more bills to pay i don't know it's kind
of interesting but the type twos are are
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect like you can i can smoke as much
of a 1.5 to 1 like high higher thc and cbd
[SPEAKER_09]: and i get high i get good it lasts longer
i just don't get the the where's my keys
[SPEAKER_09]: or the what the fuck what's going on you
know what i mean that's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling good it's about feeling good as
versus how high can you get you can tear
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of your head off with enough thc
and it doesn't feel good i love thc but
[SPEAKER_01]: i've had too much a couple times in my
life and it's just not fun type two type
[SPEAKER_01]: twos uh they dab beautifully and there's
just this physical as well as mental
[SPEAKER_01]: experience of feeling good which they're
not wrong with feeling good yeah mark
[SPEAKER_08]: there's another interesting thing about
the type twos that we discovered at the
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation classic which dr 80 ray ran
the back end as a neuroscientist
[SPEAKER_08]: evaluating judges who were actually like a
massive group over many years we're
[SPEAKER_08]: actually going to publish and sometime
shortly i think uh in the next hopefully
[SPEAKER_08]: month or two this piece that summarizes
all the findings one of the most
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting things that we've discovered
in the last couple of months is that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lot of people who have been able
to focus on the task issue and not serving
[SPEAKER_08]: you know this broad demographic and like
being inclusive with all the people coming
[SPEAKER_08]: in i also agree that just with everything
mark said i i really generally like i
[SPEAKER_08]: really love type twos in the daytime i i
absolutely feel grounded focused and able
[SPEAKER_08]: to have kind of really really tight focus
on the task and carry through to complete
[SPEAKER_08]: execution i like the type ones a lot more
in the night i mean it's just that's been
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of the rhythm but i currently have
about 14 different type twos and of course
[SPEAKER_08]: we're working on different terpene
dominance astor works was a terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant type two which was funny because
it definitely i got some of that feedback
[SPEAKER_08]: there were certainly some people that that
was not a positive thing for and then a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of others that have really loved it
for me it's a little bit psychedelic i
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely have an altered state of
consciousness that's distinct from just
[SPEAKER_08]: high thc there's there's a kind of an
expansive state that i think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful and i love the idea that there's
a way in which this might open the door to
[SPEAKER_08]: a whole lot of people that are not
currently engaging with cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: therapeutics to kind of replace way more
harmful things and have a sustainable
[SPEAKER_08]: lifelong relationship with our with this
beautiful planet it's interesting you
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned the product trials with specific
audiences because you know i have a
[SPEAKER_09]: classical education in academia so i
presented a lot of non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: conferences and one of the most
interesting conferences i talk at is
[SPEAKER_09]: called the food flavor and fragrance
conference and when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: figure out what potato is best for a
french fry or what tomato is best for a
[SPEAKER_09]: tomato sauce you actually have to
segregate your populations because some
[SPEAKER_09]: people don't have a certain type of taste
bud so they can't taste a certain flavor
[SPEAKER_09]: and so when you're creating your
demographic your target audience you have
[SPEAKER_09]: to break them apart and use different
products to see which ones they like and
[SPEAKER_09]: then actually create a product product
that is targeted to a specific audience
[SPEAKER_09]: and that that's exactly what the
innovations in behind enhanced or type two
[SPEAKER_09]: flowers are our group calls them enhanced
because when you get to the store level
[SPEAKER_09]: and the consumer level they love them but
when you say hey type two they kind of get
[SPEAKER_09]: lost but when you say enhanced it's like
enhanced with cpd or whatever it sounds a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit more palatable on the consumer
tone you know i kind of want to go down
[SPEAKER_12]: the rabbit hole of that anxiety experience
because i have always smoked type one like
[SPEAKER_12]: dabbed large rips you know had a high
tolerance you know the first time i ever
[SPEAKER_12]: met sam i'm quite certain he was trying to
kill me and he didn't and i survived and
[SPEAKER_12]: it's almost what bonded our friendship i
remember the next day when he smoked a
[SPEAKER_12]: bowl with someone at the cannabis cup and
knocked them unconscious and then they got
[SPEAKER_12]: up and they had been sharing a booth with
me the guy was working for hemp employees
[SPEAKER_12]: and he said oh i want you to do that to
him and he was pointing to me and sam was
[SPEAKER_12]: like yeah yeah that's not going to happen
to him sort of thing and you know it
[SPEAKER_12]: wasn't until my father was killed in a
motorcycle accident with his wife my
[SPEAKER_12]: stepmother on a motorcycle i purchased him
for his 50th birthday that i had this sort
[SPEAKER_12]: of trauma and stress that occurred in my
body that had never occurred before in my
[SPEAKER_12]: life and cannabis high thc in particular
seemed to bring it up to the surface and i
[SPEAKER_12]: i can't say it was a bad thing because i
think it's how i worked through that
[SPEAKER_12]: anxiety and stress i pulled it out i
experienced it i held it and i transformed
[SPEAKER_12]: it and it took years i'll be honest it
happened again years later when i was in a
[SPEAKER_12]: very bad dirt bike accident of my own and
i absolutely crushed my lower back i mean
[SPEAKER_12]: i was walking you know like like like a
like a baby for about three and a half
[SPEAKER_12]: months i still have pain four years later
i go see an ims guy all the time and you
[SPEAKER_12]: know when it flares up i and i'll take
that what really high thc particularly
[SPEAKER_12]: high terpenaline narrow leaf drug cultivar
that it almost flares up that pain and and
[SPEAKER_12]: and creates these sorts of anxiety attacks
now for me i've sort of worked through
[SPEAKER_12]: those as well and i've gotten back to that
place where i can really enjoy a big dab
[SPEAKER_12]: but those were two instances in my life
where i was unable to take big dabs even
[SPEAKER_12]: in my youtube videos you know i'll i'll do
the video where i did the the rosin press
[SPEAKER_12]: it's got almost five million views on it
and i took a half pound and i ran it
[SPEAKER_12]: through the peer pressure and at the end i
take a little dab there's probably a
[SPEAKER_12]: hundred people on there that comment on
the small size of the dab that i took well
[SPEAKER_12]: the cultivar was where is my bike and
whereas my bike is a biker kush crossed
[SPEAKER_12]: with an amnesia haze so it's extremely
high in terpenaline and it's a very strong
[SPEAKER_12]: cultivar that gives people anxiety attacks
and i wonder if we could get into that
[SPEAKER_12]: what is the psychology of that are we
pulling up stress to transform it is it
[SPEAKER_12]: you know like is it finding something
that's there that needs to be processed or
[SPEAKER_12]: are we just at a point in our lives where
we need to look at maybe some of the type
[SPEAKER_12]: two and and and type three plants i can
speak for the chemistry if you want i mean
[SPEAKER_09]: to terpenaline is basically a structural
isomer with limonene and on the phytofax
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenaline is red because of that exact
reason it's like one of the most sativa it
[SPEAKER_09]: gives you the most sativa like effects
right um limonene is also um a stimulant
[SPEAKER_09]: and antidepressant the only difference
between the two molecules is the location
[SPEAKER_09]: of the double bond and the first time i
ever smoked a terpenaline cultivar was
[SPEAKER_09]: train wreck in santa barbara and some
dude's house who he slept on the couch and
[SPEAKER_09]: every bedroom had black and white paper
being sucked in from all the carbon
[SPEAKER_09]: filters and i had the same experience
marcus was describing with david where i
[SPEAKER_09]: was like oh shit i'm he's setting me up
somebody's coming to bust me right now and
[SPEAKER_09]: and was like then after that we super
bonded and it was the research we did with
[SPEAKER_09]: the type two terpenaline cultivars where
we noticed in the blind study that as you
[SPEAKER_09]: added cbd to thc the terpene the terpene
entourage effect became more apparent so
[SPEAKER_09]: you know people would feel that
stimulating effect and we also used to
[SPEAKER_09]: just take terpenes and put them on the
volcano and inhale them and see how they
[SPEAKER_09]: made us feel right and terpenaline and and
it sometimes made things sparkly and
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely increased your heart rate like
with limonene make you talk a little
[SPEAKER_09]: faster and that's kind of the background
on that thanks mark sam you had something
[SPEAKER_12]: to say yeah but i'm spaced out and i
forgot we were talking about anxiety and
[SPEAKER_12]: stress and uh you know in inducing those
things when they're deep down no i was
[SPEAKER_07]: just gonna say that a lot of times it's
fear of like with psychedelics it's fear
[SPEAKER_07]: of the fear that pushes people really over
the edge when they uh smoke too much for
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves if they just relax let go and
don't worry about it they're actually fine
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah we know we know henry's dhc is
angiogenic right which just means that it
[SPEAKER_11]: it promotes anxiety um but there's you
know on the terpenaline front there's
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely something there because i mean
that's kind of been anecdotal about those
[SPEAKER_11]: amnesia hazes and that that class of weed
um for years people have said that you
[SPEAKER_11]: know it kind of makes them squirrely so
there there might actually be something to
[SPEAKER_11]: that um i think something that maybe
wasn't totally clear when mark was
[SPEAKER_11]: describing the ratios and the type twos
when we started doing all these crosses
[SPEAKER_11]: and and making these original type two
lines um from unstabilized parents we
[SPEAKER_11]: realized that there was different plants
um that would they would essentially spit
[SPEAKER_11]: different ratios of cannabinoids in the
offspring so we had you know the first
[SPEAKER_11]: ones to come out or like the like mark was
saying the one to twos the one to ones and
[SPEAKER_11]: then the two to ones we always put thc
first because it's you know in the ratio
[SPEAKER_11]: just because it's easy to understand most
people it's the it's the number most
[SPEAKER_11]: people are looking at um but after
breeding and creating parental lines that
[SPEAKER_11]: would make each of those crosses and and
doing some kind of nifty breeding tricks
[SPEAKER_11]: in between the the types we actually found
that there was plants that were like four
[SPEAKER_11]: to one thc to cvd and an eight to one um
thc to cvd or sorry thc to cvd and those
[SPEAKER_11]: numbers aren't really like those those
plants you have to do special breeding
[SPEAKER_11]: tricks to pull them out like they're not
just floating around the drug the the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace okay um and we started to
realize when you have those different
[SPEAKER_11]: ratios of thc and cvd really the different
it's like you have a total thc with a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of a cvd buffer i think was
what we were calling it at first it really
[SPEAKER_11]: changes it takes a lot of the edge off of
that anxiety from the thc um which for
[SPEAKER_11]: some people is just too much you know
there's a whole segment of the population
[SPEAKER_11]: i know everybody likes to do these massive
dabs and get as high as you can but when
[SPEAKER_11]: you you know when you're using cannabis
for medicine um and you you don't come
[SPEAKER_11]: from that world where you're just trying
to get blissed all the time there are
[SPEAKER_11]: adverse you know some of these these
anxiety effects that you have with thc are
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of like adverse right it's not it's
not ideal for mom to be getting way too
[SPEAKER_11]: high to the point where she doesn't want
to use the medicine right because you lose
[SPEAKER_11]: the benefit you lose the medical benefit
if you're getting too high you're scaring
[SPEAKER_11]: people away from the medicine um and so
having these you know what we've we
[SPEAKER_11]: realize is that having these these kind of
different levels of cvd buffer it kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: takes the edge off the thc for a whole
different group of people um type 2 is in
[SPEAKER_03]: the market could that be could that be
action on on dopamine release i because i
[SPEAKER_03]: i i think cvd is different than thc isn't
it we're talking about these kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: things it's for me it's like you know i
studied neuroscience in university um and
[SPEAKER_11]: after coming out of that process i kind of
my feeling on the brain is that we're
[SPEAKER_11]: still just pushing buttons right like what
does this lever do kind of thing it's
[SPEAKER_11]: because there's such complicated hair
balls right it's like thc interacts with
[SPEAKER_11]: dopamine which crosstalks with
norepinephrine which it you know impacts
[SPEAKER_11]: the opioid system and serotonin to say
conclusively that x does y is really
[SPEAKER_11]: really difficult especially when we're you
know we're we're essentially just
[SPEAKER_09]: speculating it mechanism and we find what
we find a new receptor every month or when
[SPEAKER_09]: not literally but kind of and i think it's
going to have to be big data that ever
[SPEAKER_09]: figures it out no humans going to figure
it out it's going to be big blue or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever on an individual basis it's
really important to remember every
[SPEAKER_01]: person's endocannabinoid system is
different than their need for this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis chemistry differs i love the idea
of building data sets so we can sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: generalize more fully but yeah um our
bodies are not single molecule systems and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plant is not single molecule so
and that's it's really i love that image
[SPEAKER_01]: of a hairball of of things going on in the
body it's a big knot it's like a big yarn
[SPEAKER_11]: knot right like how do you tease that
whole thing apart when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: understand the the bits at play and you
know we we exist in a system where you
[SPEAKER_11]: know a doctor doesn't like the idea of
having to try you on 10 different drugs
[SPEAKER_11]: before they figure out which one works
they want to say oh you're this type we
[SPEAKER_11]: need to give you this type of drug and
we're just not at that point in time yet
[SPEAKER_11]: but um the you know the range of type two
plants that we now have and i assume mark
[SPEAKER_11]: that you've continued to put those
cannabinoid ratios into all the different
[SPEAKER_11]: flavor profiles it's like you're
essentially creating a spectrum of plants
[SPEAKER_11]: that people can then you know choose from
and and really you know sounds lame but
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like choose your own adventure right
like you can dial the the the experience
[SPEAKER_11]: into the user when you have all these
different types yeah um just for a second
[SPEAKER_09]: ryan one of the product lines out here
that these technologies have gone into is
[SPEAKER_09]: called speciality alley and it's uh it
basically is a like a lemon crush or a
[SPEAKER_09]: really gassy og nose and there is a low
thc version a one to one version and a
[SPEAKER_09]: high thc version the 1.5 to 1 version uh
is is on the market as well so it's
[SPEAKER_09]: basically all the the flavors of a gassy
og and the the the thc to cpd ratios cross
[SPEAKER_09]: the whole spectrum and you know you
mentioned you know all the people on this
[SPEAKER_09]: show are big dabbers or whatever but we
have consumers that once we turn them on
[SPEAKER_09]: to an enhanced or a like a one to one or
two to one dab that's how they start the
[SPEAKER_09]: day and they find and even in the surveys
show that they feel like they get higher
[SPEAKER_09]: at night when they use their type one
again so it's almost like you look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: science and mcpartland and the study of
australia it's like you're you have this
[SPEAKER_09]: endocannabinoid tone or health that you're
trying to maintain and if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: constantly banging a large signal of an 80
thc your body actually changes and you
[SPEAKER_09]: start down regulating receptors so not
only is your ball of yarn or hairball
[SPEAKER_09]: complex to tease out it's constantly
changing and rewrapping itself so if you
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're a heavy user of thc i just urge
you to just try it a couple times in the
[SPEAKER_09]: morning coffee and then then go back to
your high thc and you'll find that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: actually that's perfect it's like a great
thing that's that's actually how i use now
[SPEAKER_08]: it says you know it's perfect yes yes yes
i wanted oh sorry and also there's
[SPEAKER_08]: something about what marcus brought up as
he entered this that i really wanted to
[SPEAKER_08]: catch that i love um there's a
psychological perspective about anxiety
[SPEAKER_08]: different than biochemical i think about
the role of anxiety um and this is my
[SPEAKER_08]: background i went my graduate degree was
at pacifica and i was really a youngian
[SPEAKER_08]: but the reality is i i think about the ego
dystonic experience and the way in which
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the things universal to
psychedelics is that you must have this
[SPEAKER_08]: ego dystonic moment in order to have the
opportunity to leave behind a lot of the
[SPEAKER_08]: baggage and complexity of this kind of
last awareness to be very very present i
[SPEAKER_08]: think about fear as sam brought up and the
kind of low-laying latent anxiety like
[SPEAKER_08]: modern living disease and the way in which
you know most of us throughout varying
[SPEAKER_08]: levels of stress that would surpass what
other humans and other generations may
[SPEAKER_08]: have even possibly conceived of that there
is a a fundamental stress baseline that i
[SPEAKER_08]: think is quite high you can look at
epinephrine and biochemistry and stuff but
[SPEAKER_08]: the bottom line is i think we're primarily
producing cortisol throughout the day most
[SPEAKER_08]: of the time i actually did a trial at one
point where i had heart rate monitoring
[SPEAKER_08]: and i was really working to understand at
what point i could reduce cortisol
[SPEAKER_08]: production i could not even get to that
state in a sitting meditating position the
[SPEAKER_08]: only way i could achieve it was in a slow
walking meditation following really slow
[SPEAKER_08]: breathing and eventually i got there and
then realized we're basically on these
[SPEAKER_08]: really hard drugs so much of the time and
this of course is very damaging but again
[SPEAKER_08]: back to the anxiety i feel there's like
marcus was saying an invitation towards an
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity to be present and to filter
some of the fear and the latent trauma and
[SPEAKER_08]: the experiences that hopefully i do get
cleared so i think there's a really like
[SPEAKER_08]: i've always been a pretty high anxiety
person and i think that's one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: things that's drawn me to cannabis in
general but i've been able to mitigate the
[SPEAKER_08]: worst expressions of that and the high
functioning by virtue in part and
[SPEAKER_08]: especially in the last eight years or so
with type twos i'm excited about what that
[SPEAKER_08]: represents and that also one other thing
you said mark just this notion that i
[SPEAKER_08]: actually get i i really enjoy my type one
highs more there's a dimensionality
[SPEAKER_08]: there's something it's punctuated when i
get into a groove where i'm on type one a
[SPEAKER_08]: whole bunch throughout many many days it's
just it it flattens out i'm missing nuance
[SPEAKER_08]: and depth and dimension it's that it's
opening up this much bigger space so i
[SPEAKER_08]: really love that diverse endocannabinoid
diet to accommodate also diverse
[SPEAKER_08]: endocannabinoid tone i just think it's
such a cool direction you know one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: more oh go ahead kelly hi everybody um and
welcome oh thank you so much it's so nice
[SPEAKER_00]: to be here the conversation is super
important and really awesome um i just
[SPEAKER_00]: think that when we're talking about
cannabis and we're talking about analgesic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabis i think that it's
really important that we don't forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a conscious changing uh plant this
is not necessarily a symptomatic plant
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant can get to the root of things
very quickly so when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: analgesics we need to also delve into the
analgesics of the emotions of the mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that this plant is not just going to hit
some type of a symptomatic symptom but
[SPEAKER_00]: when we smoke cannabis or when we ingest
cannabis or even when we use it topically
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be going to the root it's
going to be attacking it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down those subconscious layers
that we have that hold us back from our
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate healing and that's where we're
talking about fear we're talking about all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things because we also have pain is
associated with emotional ties just like
[SPEAKER_00]: you were saying mark did you know when you
hurt your back that there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: emotions that are tied into that like we
have symptoms upon immediate effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of an injury and then when we
ingest cannabis it brings it all up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface so in talking about the scientific
measures of it and talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids there's this whole unknown
that comes into play maybe jeremy you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it as the ego and i'd like
to go even deeper than the ego this is our
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate you know bodily function that we
have and how we're dealing and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: cortisol is a huge player to this so when
people are ingesting it's like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to how many layers of onion you know do
you have to be able to get to the center
[SPEAKER_00]: of dealing with the issue that you're
trying to get to and i find that in
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with patients you know i'll be
treating a knee injury and then one month
[SPEAKER_00]: later wow we really we're dealing with
some massive childhood trauma that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant brought up all of these different
symptoms and then that was what healed the
[SPEAKER_00]: knee so i think that if we pull more away
from symptomatic healing which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: allopathy and which is what western
medicine has shown us then we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: aligning with the true healing nature of
this plant which is to bring science and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring observational experience to bring
emotional experience and not differentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: when we talk about pain and healing that
we don't differentiate the physical pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and healing with the emotional pain and
healing because they are all one and the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant continues to show us that i would
just add that you know our disposition of
[SPEAKER_06]: our microbiome affects our endocannabinoid
system so health and well-being through
[SPEAKER_06]: food is going to affect the cannabis as it
comes in also toxicity in the plant can
[SPEAKER_06]: often create anxiety in the person and we
know often we've met people and and have
[SPEAKER_06]: close family members with you know that
have gone through hypermesis syndrome or
[SPEAKER_06]: or anxiety with cannabis and they will
smoke a regeneratively grown organic
[SPEAKER_06]: flower and it will not give them the same
effects so we are dealing with toxic
[SPEAKER_06]: overloads it's very important for us to
detox ourselves so that this medicine can
[SPEAKER_00]: be so powerful we love and appreciate you
all i'm sorry just to jump on it one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time i believe that when we talk a lot
about the science and we're pushing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about the cannabinoids that we really need
to almost step back a little bit and we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to not ask more of the plant than
what she can offer i believe that this new
[SPEAKER_00]: time and this new outcome in this plant is
having you know an out coming from a time
[SPEAKER_00]: of victimization of of being shrouded and
and we're asking so much of her and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to come to like all of these finite
answers and magical remedies without
[SPEAKER_00]: letting her just sort of unravel and show
herself and and and watch the experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're all having with this plant
rather than trying to come to definitive
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions of it right away because each
person is having such a differential
[SPEAKER_09]: experience and a differential effect i
agree more with that i mean when we do our
[SPEAKER_09]: panels one of the things we notice is that
it's it's not just a high it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: behavioral distinct change things taste
better things feel better you're more
[SPEAKER_09]: intuitive so there is definitely a
spiritual component and what's beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: about chemistry is that you can take a
dive into everything that i mean you can
[SPEAKER_09]: look at thousands of compounds that are in
this plant i mean you can dig down to the
[SPEAKER_09]: the heavy metals the flavonoids the
terpenes and and then you can cross
[SPEAKER_09]: compare and analyze and have a whole panel
where people discuss you know it changes
[SPEAKER_09]: the flavor of salts to some it makes
sweets sweeter to others and it ties right
[SPEAKER_09]: back into what rafi moshulam says where he
thinks that the you know endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: system has a major contribution to your
your personality right ryan i mean that's
[SPEAKER_08]: one of his famous sayings yeah there's
another uh thing that we would be remiss
[SPEAKER_08]: to uh bring up if as mojave is not with us
today and mojave has a variety that he's
[SPEAKER_08]: worked with for a very long time called
zeta it's a terpenoline dawn variety it
[SPEAKER_08]: reminds me a bit of zellie's gift actually
which i love that plant she's so beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: but i think of mojave reminiscing about
moderate thc combined with terpenoline as
[SPEAKER_08]: this spiritual plant from big sir and in
this population at the root of that kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of moment in time was the most sought
after and spiritual cannabis i just think
[SPEAKER_08]: it's fascinating though that was again
probably like 10 to 15 percent thc and
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenoline dawn and i think that's a
that's a really beautiful profile and and
[SPEAKER_10]: hey this is colin this is also touching on
on a conversation we had the other day
[SPEAKER_10]: which was you know the physiological and
the the the sense of uh of memory tied to
[SPEAKER_10]: uh the different terpene profiles or
chemical profiles i think there's a
[SPEAKER_10]: lineage directly correlated to those
things and in how we're associating our
[SPEAKER_10]: personal uh you know opinions of what is
good and what is bad um and over the years
[SPEAKER_10]: you know terpenoline i think has been a
dominant in terms of everyone's flavor
[SPEAKER_10]: profile and i think there's there's no
mistake over that there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_10]: memory uh sensories uh you know being
evoked in things in you know in our bodies
[SPEAKER_10]: and in our minds and i think that's uh
also the the connection that that happens
[SPEAKER_10]: with with all these different chemicals is
the the sensory of memory and how that uh
[SPEAKER_09]: brings us into into now yeah and i believe
one of our trials also showed that you
[SPEAKER_09]: know you add a little bit of cbd and it
actually helps with the memory loss issue
[SPEAKER_09]: um so there's definitely formulations for
that and you know that's why we like to
[SPEAKER_09]: call the the type two's enhanced because
we feel like they can enhance every aspect
[SPEAKER_09]: of your life whether it's you know waking
up in the morning being creative going on
[SPEAKER_09]: a run or partying down it's like there's
there's this ability to find a chemical
[SPEAKER_09]: mixture cocktail that's going to improve
your life and you know what in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't chemistry you know yeah you know
also i've noticed that a little uh splash
[SPEAKER_00]: of that cbd and working with patients over
the years and then really finiting our
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one i really am believing that that
splash of cbd is what brings those
[SPEAKER_00]: cortisol levels down which helps you know
have a recognition of what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with that we uh characters um you
know need to focus think that that cbd
[SPEAKER_00]: brings it down just and realize where the
medicine needs to go also something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not talking about here is that in
working with patients there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible integral um almost electric
energy that's going on when a person is
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting cannabis it's so it's it's it's
so experiential it's so incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: personal that almost to have a
relationship with the person that is
[SPEAKER_00]: offering the medicine to you or dr louis
you know you're talking about having
[SPEAKER_00]: patients study having these patients
studies that are more intimate and more
[SPEAKER_00]: involved i'm finding we really get to the
root of things much faster which is again
[SPEAKER_00]: not an allopathic model it's following
something a little bit more different a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more natural and following more
about what the plant and kelly there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: wonderful piece uh there with
psychopharmacology there's this whole body
[SPEAKER_08]: of research that illustrates say you give
somebody an ssri and they have depressive
[SPEAKER_08]: features you'll actually find
statistically over time very often that
[SPEAKER_08]: will not benefit the person at all but if
you pair that with counseling now you have
[SPEAKER_08]: this unbelievable opportunity so it's a
relational element that i feel is often
[SPEAKER_08]: missing in our therapeutic conversation
i've approached that in a way at the
[SPEAKER_08]: pharma counter that i got to experiment
with a huge community of patients where it
[SPEAKER_08]: always felt like when people were new to
cannabis there was this simple orientation
[SPEAKER_08]: to here's an array of phytochemical
profiles but you know don't attach too
[SPEAKER_08]: much value to that but at least have some
association with what sort of different
[SPEAKER_08]: profiles you're consuming but then you
know titration and dosage start with these
[SPEAKER_08]: tiny increments and really get to know
those different increments at different
[SPEAKER_08]: times and then let's move into the
delivery systems and here's this array of
[SPEAKER_08]: different ways to relate with the plant at
some point bringing in a journaling
[SPEAKER_08]: process and an observation process and
then watching people's lives transform
[SPEAKER_08]: again and again by essentially providing
both education but more than that impact
[SPEAKER_08]: attunement really feeling into that
hugeness as somebody approaches the
[SPEAKER_08]: possibility of bringing an altered state
of consciousness into their life i do
[SPEAKER_08]: think to help that altered state of
consciousness to then sort of be midwifed
[SPEAKER_08]: or carried toward a sort of therapeutic
direction can be a relational dynamic and
[SPEAKER_08]: that cannabis very often provides that
opportunity the spirit is there but also
[SPEAKER_08]: now there's this one other element that i
feel community actually needs to uphold
[SPEAKER_08]: and to hit that highest level of
meaningful benefits it's great because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what the plant plant medicine
continues to teach us over and over again
[SPEAKER_00]: is that set in setting and how wonderful
that now plant medicine is is even
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrating into western medicine and
they're even starting to have
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations about set in setting and
maybe even painting their their offices a
[SPEAKER_00]: color that you know is more soothing to
their patients these things that are all
[SPEAKER_09]: coming from from plant medicine you said
color you said color that's why we
[SPEAKER_09]: developed the phytofax was because people
couldn't know what was in their medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: before i have a question for you dr louis
which is what's type four type five type
[SPEAKER_09]: six what's four is what cbga i believe so
five is cannabinoid lists rose by any
[SPEAKER_09]: other name who cares who cares well it's
important because right now this is a
[SPEAKER_09]: one-dimensional product in a marketplace
that craves multi-dimensional products you
[SPEAKER_09]: add cbd now you have a two-dimensional
product plus with all the terpenes oh look
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a phytofax that's nice i
absolutely agree with you so so when
[SPEAKER_09]: you're dealing with all of these these
things these components and then you have
[SPEAKER_09]: all the you have the cultivar strain names
on top of it it creates this white noise
[SPEAKER_09]: where no one can hear anything and this is
why we developed the phytofax was so that
[SPEAKER_09]: people could look at a tool and and
recognize things for instance somebody
[SPEAKER_09]: comes in and they're looking for something
that's limonene dominant and they usually
[SPEAKER_09]: use the space force one that's on the
right it's high thc thing but then they
[SPEAKER_09]: have all these other googly gob names out
there i don't know i've heard a bunch on
[SPEAKER_11]: look we put these up a lot or not i just
think that a lot of people are seeing
[SPEAKER_11]: these for the first time so why don't you
walk us through the different sections of
[SPEAKER_11]: the phytofax so people can understand how
to read them like the canadile and then
[SPEAKER_06]: the you know sounds good so if you if you
look at the bar sorry marcus can you make
[SPEAKER_06]: that a little bigger because i feel i find
it a little hard to read and if you if you
[SPEAKER_06]: could that would be cool bring the screen
in but go ahead you can also zoom it in on
[SPEAKER_11]: your computer control plus or if you're on
a mac just use your your your scroll pad
[SPEAKER_14]: or whatever yeah on zoom also you can move
your bar over so it gets larger nice cool
[SPEAKER_09]: well he messes with that i'll get started
here so are these are these deterping
[SPEAKER_09]: profiles of cured bud or a fresh harvest
okay these are so the reason that this was
[SPEAKER_09]: developed just so give you a little
backstory here was back in the wild wild
[SPEAKER_09]: west days at dispensaries you know intake
day where they were buying flowers would
[SPEAKER_09]: be a a line of people out the door with
duffel bags and you know managers would be
[SPEAKER_09]: on the spot to etienne knows exactly what
i'm talking about especially in berkeley i
[SPEAKER_09]: mean you would have like 80 people lined
up half of them with dirty fingernails and
[SPEAKER_14]: like cat hair in their weed oh yeah yeah
so much cat hairs dog hair sometimes check
[SPEAKER_09]: it out right yeah but dude we found bloody
razor blades i mean you you name it it's
[SPEAKER_09]: in there and you would actually be
physically sick for a day or two after
[SPEAKER_09]: from smelling all the mold and and pests
and pathogens that are you know coming up
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway so we would find that there was no
quality standard for the products being
[SPEAKER_09]: purchased and you know favoritism was a
thing we got commissioned to create a
[SPEAKER_09]: certificate of analysis for finished
products so this isn't a phytofax of a wet
[SPEAKER_09]: flower these are chemical analysis of
finished products and starting at the top
[SPEAKER_09]: or at the very bottom because it ties into
the top is the phyto print that's
[SPEAKER_09]: essentially a terpene fingerprint that is
you know our laboratory analyzes like 60
[SPEAKER_09]: plus low molecular weight and high
molecular weight terpenes and molecules
[SPEAKER_09]: that actually create the total nose
bouquet these aren't all of the molecules
[SPEAKER_09]: that contribute to the flavor and aroma
but they are the top 17 that are commonly
[SPEAKER_09]: occurring and most biologically relevant
okay so it's color coded from just like
[SPEAKER_09]: roy gbiv like a rainbow and the warm tones
are associated with sativa like um effects
[SPEAKER_09]: we don't have a terpenoline dominant plant
in here but that would be the red bar at
[SPEAKER_09]: the very top and you've heard us discuss
how terpenoline has a tendency to make
[SPEAKER_09]: some people anxious while others like
david really liked the train wreck bubble
[SPEAKER_09]: hash that was high terpenoline because he
said it was the most sativa uh hash that
[SPEAKER_09]: was available when he visited um limonene
is a warm tone as well so those represent
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of sativa like plants and then as you
go down into the green as pining you know
[SPEAKER_09]: the blues or the your your sesquiterpenes
your humilines your karyophyllines and
[SPEAKER_09]: then linalool and mercine are at the
bottom they're more associated with your
[SPEAKER_09]: indica like effects so you can kind of
associate your cultivar name so like if
[SPEAKER_09]: you look at a girl scout cookies if it
would be just beta karyophylline dominant
[SPEAKER_09]: with little humiline and limonene little
mercine and then once you find a cultivar
[SPEAKER_09]: you like based on nose and flavor you
don't have to remember all the strain
[SPEAKER_09]: names associated with it it just becomes
color pattern recognition which is way
[SPEAKER_09]: easier for our simple minds to to grasp i
like the purple ones i like the yellow
[SPEAKER_09]: ones and you know david like the red ones
right so um if you go back or it's
[SPEAKER_11]: important to notice too that like the
colors for example that you see on this
[SPEAKER_11]: bottom bar graph like the actual colored
bar graph is correlated to the entourage
[SPEAKER_11]: effect and the smell and the aroma so you
can see that the entourage effect they're
[SPEAKER_11]: also they're also color coded so for
example on this one that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_11]: here on the left it's hyanosamine which is
the orange on the the lower section of the
[SPEAKER_11]: phytoprint where the terpene profile is
you can if you look up one panel above it
[SPEAKER_11]: on the right side you can see that it's
also highest in in the orange triangle
[SPEAKER_11]: which is associated with calm right so the
idea is that this is a lab report format
[SPEAKER_11]: that either that a lab will give you that
you might see at a dispensary or you might
[SPEAKER_11]: see it on a packaging but the idea is that
like mark is saying even without getting
[SPEAKER_11]: in all the nitty-gritty details you're
subliminally being fed these these
[SPEAKER_11]: messages um like mark can you actually
scroll up a little bit since you're on
[SPEAKER_03]: we're sharing your screen how much do you
see you see in terpene profile from from
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest to harvest from grow to grow it
seems like that would be really variable
[SPEAKER_03]: and that ultimately is going to affect
that graph above and the other thing i
[SPEAKER_03]: just wanted to ask you mark we had an
interesting discussion in in clubhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: with mike bacchus the other night and i
asked him specifically um does he see what
[SPEAKER_03]: change in the terpene profile between
fresh harvest and and cure does he see and
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically does he see uh any increase
in linalool with decrease in in uh and
[SPEAKER_03]: mercy and the correlated question i would
ask based on what we just what you had
[SPEAKER_03]: discussed earlier is you know terpene is
one of what four isomers of of terpene and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of those can oxidized terpene all and
terpene all certainly has a very different
[SPEAKER_03]: fragrance than than terpene itself so i
was wondering if you could comment on how
[SPEAKER_03]: these terpene profiles change between
harvest and cure okay um real quick i'll
[SPEAKER_09]: hit that in a second just that you see the
cultivar name at the top of this report
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the top three terpenes create
that color code so that's that was the
[SPEAKER_09]: pattern recognition i was talking about
now when we discovered so one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: things we do in the laboratory when we're
trying you know skunk works no pun
[SPEAKER_09]: intended actually we'll buy analytical
standards and we'll smell them you know
[SPEAKER_09]: because we'll find little blips and hit on
the mass spec and determine its molecular
[SPEAKER_09]: weight and like oh i wonder if it's this
or that and one day we opened up a bottle
[SPEAKER_09]: of hexylbutyrate and it's it's it smells
like luden's cherry cough drops i mean it
[SPEAKER_09]: literally a stringent cherry makes your
mouth or mouth water as soon as you you
[SPEAKER_09]: smell it so you're very different than
butyric acid right very very different yes
[SPEAKER_09]: and so it smells like puke so what we did
was we we went straight to the
[SPEAKER_09]: chromatograms uh well we shot that on the
on the gc we looked at this retention time
[SPEAKER_09]: we looked at all the chromatograms for all
the plants that we'd analyze and um we
[SPEAKER_09]: found little blips then we immediately
called up molecular farms and said hey
[SPEAKER_09]: these code numbers have those blips start
inbreeding them and they they inbred like
[SPEAKER_09]: four generations until that blip became so
concentrated it was almost one percent
[SPEAKER_09]: hexylbutyrate and i mean that plant when
it's in the field you get that little
[SPEAKER_09]: trichome rub and smell it makes your mouth
water smells like the luden's cherry cough
[SPEAKER_09]: drops it's pining dominant with mercy in
it you take that plant and you cure it dry
[SPEAKER_09]: it and cure it uh you know it's best fresh
not like sitting for a month or anything
[SPEAKER_09]: but over time the hexylbutyrate will just
and it'd be gone because it's a low
[SPEAKER_09]: molecular weight terpene right and dry is
that just evaporation it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: transforming into something else correct
correct just fugitive okay yeah so um so
[SPEAKER_09]: and if you it can let me back up it can
transform to something else if you leave
[SPEAKER_09]: in the jar too long and it get oxidized
but if you look at the flowers on the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant to to to the i mean sorry the
terpenes on the plant to the finished
[SPEAKER_09]: product um there can be little change or
there can be massive change to the
[SPEAKER_09]: relative profile and it all depends on
your post harvest post-processing um
[SPEAKER_09]: conditions and that's that's one of the
things that napro really helps cultivators
[SPEAKER_09]: with because most cultivators and you know
i mean i know that the people listen to
[SPEAKER_09]: show aren't most cultivators the people on
the show probably know how to dry and cure
[SPEAKER_09]: a plant to preserve their terpenes but
most people destroy the plant like they're
[SPEAKER_09]: they're worried about cost of goods
they're worried about business business
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff you know not not not like us we
worship the plant you know it's like we
[SPEAKER_09]: want that exact flavor of a fresh flower
in in our products at the end because that
[SPEAKER_09]: smells so freaking good and it tastes so
so good and the you know we work with
[SPEAKER_09]: folks in the on the hemp side who um do
terpene distillation of the hemp and they
[SPEAKER_09]: they exclusively beg for the the the bi um
hemp genetics because they have that happy
[SPEAKER_09]: pineapple in hemp they have pining
dominant cultivars in hemp so they can get
[SPEAKER_09]: those cannabis derived terpenes and they
they they literally chop the plant down
[SPEAKER_09]: and throw it in the extractor immediately
don't freeze it don't take it anywhere and
[SPEAKER_09]: the terpene profiles are very very similar
to those that you find in the plant and
[SPEAKER_09]: then those can have an oil or those hemp
or cannabis derived terpenes can be used
[SPEAKER_09]: in vape pens in in the you know thc
marketplace and when you hit those vape
[SPEAKER_09]: pens and exhale it smells like fresh
flower it's really it's really amazing um
[SPEAKER_09]: and i'd like to if you want to pull up the
phytofax i can finish going through it or
[SPEAKER_09]: we can ditch it it's up to you marcus
you're the sort of the moderator but i
[SPEAKER_09]: would like to show that you know this
thing has these two bar charts at the top
[SPEAKER_09]: that have cannabinoids and terpenoids and
we set the scale at 25 percent and 2.5
[SPEAKER_09]: percent because when people would come to
the dispensaries with you know pounds from
[SPEAKER_09]: the hill or whatever if we just looked at
these two bars and they were pegged the
[SPEAKER_09]: manager would know that's a good flower
that's that's that's some good shit but
[SPEAKER_09]: most of the stuff in california even to
this day doesn't test above 1.5 percent
[SPEAKER_09]: terp sometimes in the two two percent
range and you know cannabinoids are all
[SPEAKER_09]: over the place and it depends on your
laboratory and whatnot but this uh you go
[SPEAKER_09]: down below that bar chart um and you have
a a dial of thc to the next highest
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid in this case of happy
pineapple it's cbga so this is about 20
[SPEAKER_09]: percent thc about eight percent cbg and
this is a very very unique cultivar it
[SPEAKER_09]: tastes delicious and when you long cure
this particular flower it takes on a
[SPEAKER_09]: distinct vanilla aroma it's totally unique
but when it's fresh it smells straight up
[SPEAKER_09]: like fresh pineapple because you know this
osamine dominance there was only one plant
[SPEAKER_09]: of osamine dominant cannabis ever tested
in the state of california until like two
[SPEAKER_09]: and a half three years ago and now is
there more there's a couple more yeah well
[SPEAKER_09]: i mean most of i mean the molecular has
about 10 of them that goes to the system
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know there was a live resident
this tastes like yeah let's ask dr louis
[SPEAKER_09]: we've only done the and shout out to
marcus for turning us on to the the peer
[SPEAKER_09]: pressure we've all we've only done the
flower rosin um they they just uh this
[SPEAKER_09]: they just planted enough this this spring
to be able to do a large run of uh you
[SPEAKER_09]: know the the bubble hash to live rosin
thing i'm more of a scientist and you know
[SPEAKER_09]: i i see oversee the quality control of
those types of things but there's like
[SPEAKER_09]: hash experts that do that stuff um and we
just do the chemical analysis right or
[SPEAKER_09]: offer ways to improve the performance of
their extraction um i have a question for
[SPEAKER_07]: you dr louis with your phytofax the happy
pineapple it shows what like an orangeish
[SPEAKER_07]: color than blue then green why those
colors because osamine is colored orange
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's the top terpene uh beta
karyophylline is blue in the phytoprint
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's the second most abundant and the
green is the yeah i can't see the entire
[SPEAKER_07]: bottom of the photo phytofax so that's why
gotcha now it's becomes much more apparent
[SPEAKER_09]: right so so then you think about uh the
smoothness of a smoke right like because
[SPEAKER_09]: that was one of the things that you know
ryan and i always wanted was smooth smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: it all it all has to do with having beta
karyophylline in there i mean that that
[SPEAKER_09]: really takes the edge off of any terpene
and you know some terpenes if you like
[SPEAKER_09]: alpha pining if it's really pining
dominant and there isn't a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: anything else it can be pretty harsh on
the back of your throat um so so it's it's
[SPEAKER_09]: similarly with terpenaline um but you have
to balance that and when you're breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: parentals or other things for a product
you have to take all of that into account
[SPEAKER_09]: you can't just pheno hunt you know i mean
that's part of it that's the funnest part
[SPEAKER_09]: but you have to be really thoughtful on
how you design a new technology like a
[SPEAKER_09]: plant like this holy crunch right here i
mean this thing has 28 you know
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids and it's beta karyophylline
limonene it's a one-to-one basically and
[SPEAKER_09]: it is the smoothest tastiest smoke and
most people you a lot of these products
[SPEAKER_09]: you just have people smoke them and they
can't distinguish you know they'll be like
[SPEAKER_09]: that's great and be like hey you know
that's a enhanced you know type two and
[SPEAKER_09]: i'll be like no way i'm like yeah see you
can get high off this stuff it's not cbd
[SPEAKER_09]: is not a buzz killer it just makes you
feel good you know what i mean and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: like this one is very very popular it
actually won the emerald cup in uh last
[SPEAKER_09]: year uh or two last year yeah i think so
in the cbd flower category technically cbd
[SPEAKER_07]: can be a buzz killer if you smoke 100
milligrams of pure cbd early in the
[SPEAKER_07]: morning then try to smoke uh even 100
milligrams of thc but you know wait like a
[SPEAKER_07]: half an hour or so and you'll find out
that the thc has little or no effect if
[SPEAKER_07]: you flood yourself with cbd first yeah
well nobody i don't think anyone really
[SPEAKER_09]: wants to bludgeon themselves with cbd when
they wake up in the morning that's that's
[SPEAKER_11]: painful so there's there's a couple of
things with with type twos in the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace i mean they've tried to roll
them out and granted i think the vast
[SPEAKER_11]: majority of type twos that have been on
the market in canada have been machine
[SPEAKER_11]: dominant they're all canatonic and
canatonic hybrids um but they they're
[SPEAKER_11]: having like zero uptake on the market
right like it's all type one everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: wants everything over 20 thc right there's
an amazing shift that's been happening in
[SPEAKER_08]: the oregon market we've been fighting this
battle for a while of course to our
[SPEAKER_11]: production space i know it happens down
there in california i'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: make a point about the canadian
marketplace how it's not able to adopt so
[SPEAKER_11]: you guys you've been able to do a bunch of
product knowledge you know market
[SPEAKER_11]: education that that has led to the
acceptance right so how do how do we go
[SPEAKER_11]: about doing that in in markets where
they're not as refined like how do you how
[SPEAKER_11]: do you go about rolling out a new market
the question is the popular education
[SPEAKER_08]: element combined with the genetics
combined with the talented folks who are
[SPEAKER_08]: producing breeding growing but i really
love that i think cultivation classic was
[SPEAKER_08]: a big impact in oregon market because
there was huge emphasis on type two it got
[SPEAKER_08]: equal attention to ones threes and
obviously there was way fewer entries but
[SPEAKER_08]: i just remember back to only three years
ago when i was trying to sell type twos
[SPEAKER_08]: and couldn't get four hundred dollars a
pound i am now selling astral works and
[SPEAKER_08]: this is one of the more exciting personal
accomplishments like it exists for at
[SPEAKER_08]: least more than the cost of production and
it is finally a viable product that lives
[SPEAKER_08]: and now there's about three other products
that are also almost at that level it's
[SPEAKER_08]: been such a battle though like you said i
just the question is really how do we help
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of people come into a kind of new
awareness about a new product category i
[SPEAKER_08]: loved what mark said that there really are
these kind of entirely new categories and
[SPEAKER_08]: this is why i like types i mean the cbg
dominant varieties now seeing type four
[SPEAKER_08]: hybrids coming into this uh this new space
i'm really excited to see like i've yet to
[SPEAKER_08]: see a type four hybrid on the market in
the rec market and i feel like that's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to represent a whole new set of
interesting possibilities and i've and
[SPEAKER_09]: i've yet to wonder though and i've yet to
see a type four hybrid with terpenes like
[SPEAKER_09]: somehow when they knocked out that
cannabinoid pathway i mean they don't test
[SPEAKER_09]: higher than 0.6 turps it's very bizarre
but they smell kind of like all of them
[SPEAKER_09]: have a similar like citrusy kind of smell
note to them and they look really
[SPEAKER_09]: beautiful like frosty kind of like
blackberry kush did back in the day or
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe remember it like was the frostiest
flower and like where does the trichome
[SPEAKER_09]: heads but pretty pretty interesting
production plant there hey guys this might
[SPEAKER_12]: be a good uh opportunity to um hear from a
few people who we haven't heard from um i
[SPEAKER_12]: thought alec was going to come in and sort
of uh introduce his friend joe who i'm
[SPEAKER_12]: actually just meeting so i wanted to maybe
get an introduction from you joe i hear
[SPEAKER_12]: you're going to be um doing some of the
emerald cup flower judging this year and
[SPEAKER_12]: alec thought it would be good for you to
be a part of the conversation and once
[SPEAKER_12]: we've heard from you i would love to hear
from mojave and then i would also love to
[SPEAKER_12]: hear from peter and then we can get right
back into our conversation awesome yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks for having me um obviously there's
a bunch of legs on this panel super super
[SPEAKER_02]: happy to be here uh alex a good friend um
i've been in the industry a little over 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years um i host a canvas education talk
show on the radio here uh sonoma county
[SPEAKER_02]: also i've been an emerald cup flower judge
for a couple years um i'm also a buyer for
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple dispensaries in our area um so
it's awesome to hear you guys talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes uh dr louis i was actually uh can
sympathize with sitting in those rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: when people were coming down off the hill
in those lines you know kind of going
[SPEAKER_02]: through those different bags um it's kind
of awesome we're one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries to do uh require testing um
that's kind of how i have my relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with alec over at sc labs we've been
rolling out a whole terpene education
[SPEAKER_02]: program over the last six months um and
then yeah with the judging this year it's
[SPEAKER_02]: funny i've actually been you know
listening to you guys talk i love it i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: really curious to know kind of what those
terpene levels are in some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: enhanced strains you're talking about um
that's actually how i've been curating now
[SPEAKER_02]: with the terpene profiles on the rnd it
allows me to have a more diverse menu on
[SPEAKER_02]: the shelf and really start to focus on the
terpenes and the different effects you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting from those plants with their
relationship with the kind of cannibinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not just all about those 20 20 25
hitters so yeah we're going through the uh
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers right now i actually have a bunch
of them right here it's kind of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're actually you can see
they're they're uh they're typed out by
[SPEAKER_02]: their different profile working my way
through that right now and um yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting but um i am curious to
know kind of what those terpene levels are
[SPEAKER_02]: um that you're seeing in those enhanced
strains um so yeah thank you guys i'm
[SPEAKER_09]: really happy to be here hey are you uh
using the phytofax now that sc labs is uh
[SPEAKER_02]: pumping them out yeah we've been using the
phytofax for a while um i started we
[SPEAKER_02]: started reaching out obviously for myself
i started watching cultivars die in our
[SPEAKER_02]: space as growers were unable to make money
off them anymore because they didn't hit
[SPEAKER_02]: certain thc percentages which we know with
the labs can vary so much right and so
[SPEAKER_02]: when we switch from our traditional market
days to the new rec days the way it was
[SPEAKER_02]: marketed is um everyone's coming in for
that you know that that liquor proof you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's like you don't go to the bar
looking for hundred proof schnapps all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time you might want a beer you might want
something a little lighter so everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of trained to go to that thc and
so using the phytofax we actually have a
[SPEAKER_02]: qr code um that we put on all the flavors
that are displayed in the store next to
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpene wheel um and it kind of
directs them straight to those and so
[SPEAKER_02]: getting people to understand it it starts
with um the bud tenders um you know at our
[SPEAKER_02]: store we're lucky enough to see around 25
000 people a month um and so for us we
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like you know that's a good platform
to start and we we wanted to work with sc
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been testing with them for a long
time and you start looking at these
[SPEAKER_02]: different rnd tests and you start and you
start seeing where the terpenes are um and
[SPEAKER_02]: you start noticing that you know mostly if
you're seeing those top 25 30 percent cc
[SPEAKER_02]: with like you were saying in our
marketplace mostly it's around one percent
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene you know a little less you're
basically looking at biomass in my opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: so for us being able to cultivate uh
curate something that's that's beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: um on a medicinal level considering that
we were rooted in that and that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of our culture here in our areas is
the medicinal benefits from the plant um
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really being able to pair that right
cultivar with the person so um yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been a challenge um but that's why
conversations like this are so important
[SPEAKER_03]: and i feel so great to be here wow thanks
thanks for that oh i was just going to add
[SPEAKER_03]: on something that he just said so does it
matter if labs like sc labs are in sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: high throughput testing mode and using gc
to profile their terpenes or i think you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys use hplc is there going to be a real
big difference no just just so there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: little background on napro um i brought a
bunch of chemists from my grad school from
[SPEAKER_09]: big pharma to help develop these
methodologies um and we wrote a paper we
[SPEAKER_09]: validated a method for a robust reliable
um analysis of terpenes and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_09]: that essentially became the gold standard
for the laboratory testing industry we
[SPEAKER_09]: made it free we paid extra to make it free
open source to everyone because we really
[SPEAKER_09]: wanted to fix the laboratory problem
because we want you know it's important
[SPEAKER_09]: that if you want to compare apples to
apples your labs can't be you know doing
[SPEAKER_09]: that conformational bias thing we're like
well if we say it's 28 we're going to get
[SPEAKER_09]: more business and it's like that doesn't
work when you're trying to you know create
[SPEAKER_09]: a a real industry right like you don't go
to the pharmacy and pick up the generic
[SPEAKER_09]: tylenol and look at it and be like oh it
says it's 500 milligrams and it's really
[SPEAKER_09]: only 200 um so we made that paper open
source and the laboratories uh you know
[SPEAKER_09]: you base their methods off of it and you
know groups like sc labs we work we serve
[SPEAKER_09]: as clients who are producers who are
distributors who we actually sc labs is
[SPEAKER_09]: one of our clients so when we send
products or uh when when one of our
[SPEAKER_09]: clients sends a product sc labs or there's
a problem with pesticide or there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: problem with heavy metals what we do is a
root cause analysis so and then we work
[SPEAKER_09]: directly with the with the testing
laboratories to try to figure out where
[SPEAKER_09]: the problem was was the problem with the
producer was the problem with the
[SPEAKER_09]: laboratory testing and sc labs chemistry
is super tight like i mean i'm very
[SPEAKER_09]: impressed with those guys have been for
nearly a decade now now and yeah so the
[SPEAKER_09]: methodology is pretty ironed out and it
doesn't matter if they're going high
[SPEAKER_09]: throughput because you can only go so fast
in a in a in a run for like a gc because
[SPEAKER_09]: you have to get you know baseline
resolution and you have to run your check
[SPEAKER_09]: standards between every run and all that
stuff and those guys are iso certified so
[SPEAKER_09]: you know they've got their chemistry
buttoned up really tight so i don't think
[SPEAKER_09]: there's really a difference the the
difference between a lab like sc labs and
[SPEAKER_09]: lab like napro is that we focus 100 on r
and d so we develop methods with like perk
[SPEAKER_09]: and elmer for their instrumentation so
then when a new laboratory opens up they
[SPEAKER_09]: can say hey here's this method that we've
already validated over here and you can
[SPEAKER_09]: analyze heavy metals or pesticides or
whatever it is and you know the it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a symbiosis right you know everybody
helping everybody and meanwhile we're
[SPEAKER_09]: developing methods for growers you know
whether it's breeding projects or or or
[SPEAKER_09]: just simply increasing yields and lowering
the need for pesticides or you know things
[SPEAKER_09]: like that it's all optimization for us and
we have a really good template so any
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers or cultivators who ever need
assistance you know look us up for sure i
[SPEAKER_06]: mean that's what we do you know and really
quickly like what the base how to preserve
[SPEAKER_06]: the terpenes in a grow you know is
valuable for people to hear again and
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe the a quick uh just what is your
best quick way for people on farms to
[SPEAKER_06]: preserve their terpenes for the market are
saying is 60 human these 60 degrees for
[SPEAKER_09]: two weeks or what yeah what we call npmh
minimally process and minimally handle
[SPEAKER_09]: slow and cold so you got it down you have
a vacuum cooler those are there's fun
[SPEAKER_09]: experiments there that you know when you
when you harvest lots of lettuce um you
[SPEAKER_09]: have to use an actual gigantic vacuum
cooler because otherwise you'll get a mold
[SPEAKER_09]: front as the head of lettuce begins to try
to get cold so you have to get a cold fast
[SPEAKER_09]: there's lots of cool things you can do and
i'm sure i'm sure marcus is fluent in
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes with all of the the bubble hash
he's done around the world hell yeah you
[SPEAKER_12]: know i'm uh definitely fluent in terpenes
shout out to young terp shout out to chili
[SPEAKER_12]: for those of you that know you know for
those of you that don't you'll figure it
[SPEAKER_12]: out uh i did want to also welcome mojave
to the room um how you doing buddy you
[SPEAKER_12]: want to uh tell everyone a little bit
about yourself and what you're working on
[SPEAKER_12]: your name came up a few times uh while uh
in the last hour and a half so it's great
[SPEAKER_04]: that you showed up yeah man thanks for
having me um sorry i came in late it's uh
[SPEAKER_04]: had one of those family mornings break
free then all of a sudden everyone went
[SPEAKER_04]: off to their respective zoom calls the
kids are on their zoom and the wife's on
[SPEAKER_04]: the zoom so it's like my turn yeah um my
name is mojave richmond um to to those who
[SPEAKER_04]: i don't know personally um good to see
everyone on here it's been nice chatting
[SPEAKER_04]: with you all on clubhouse over the uh past
couple weeks um and yeah i i'm uh you know
[SPEAKER_04]: a lifetime cannabis enthusiast and
activist and a bit of a breeder and
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivator and now a little bit of a
all-around wearer of many hats and i work
[SPEAKER_04]: with um i work with rob clark with
cannabis with a bio ergonomics group also
[SPEAKER_04]: with etienne fontaine who's a member uh an
important uh co-owner in the company which
[SPEAKER_04]: i would like to mention um and we're doing
some other stuff we're working as well
[SPEAKER_04]: with um breeders best which is a ip canvas
ip company founded by dale hunt um with
[SPEAKER_04]: ethan russo as well and yeah just trying
to stay involved and loving the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation you know i always feel like i
you know um i had such a great opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: to sit on the panel with ryan and mark and
rob on thursday for uh sacred
[SPEAKER_04]: international the breeding panel and uh i
just want to listen you know i get into
[SPEAKER_04]: this the conversation gets so high and i
just want to you know more than chiming in
[SPEAKER_04]: i love i love you know learning and i i
thought it was really interesting what uh
[SPEAKER_04]: what ryan was talking about earlier about
trying to bring these uh other terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles into um the canadian market i had
this really interesting just on that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of topic i've been having this interesting
discussion with a couple distributors here
[SPEAKER_04]: down south southern california who say the
entire southern california market doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: want jack train wreck haze sage that
they're terpenally dominant varieties just
[SPEAKER_04]: don't do well in southern california for
whatever reason and they do continue to do
[SPEAKER_04]: well in northern california and you know
there there's been some people have kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of made this hypothesis that it has to do
with the nature of the southern california
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer um which might have some validity
to it you know there's definitely is a a
[SPEAKER_04]: different kind of ethos going on down in
southern california but more than anything
[SPEAKER_04]: i think it's just about exposure you know
specifically because these terpenally
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant varieties are they grow well they
grow really great under the sun make big
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful trees um and there's a lot of
that going on in northern california but
[SPEAKER_11]: very little in southern california so you
see what about the purples can i ask you
[SPEAKER_11]: about the purples like i mean you know
graham and that blue dream isn't that same
[SPEAKER_11]: family and you know a lot of these other
ones they're high and you're seeing how do
[SPEAKER_11]: they sell down in southern socal like i'm
wondering you is it is it actually that
[SPEAKER_11]: they don't like the terpenaline or is it
that they're only so focused on the beta
[SPEAKER_04]: karyophylline like og sardis of class well
i think it has to do with exposure like
[SPEAKER_04]: for instance i mean the the terpenaline
thing i think it's just because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough terpenaline uh dominant
varieties on the market because um they
[SPEAKER_04]: just traditionally haven't been grown here
but it's interesting point about the
[SPEAKER_04]: purples i mean in the late 90s early 2000s
southern northern california purple kush
[SPEAKER_04]: purple urkel uh gdp they were everywhere
you know and in southern california they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't and they still slowly started to
trickle in in the the um you know the prop
[SPEAKER_04]: 215 medical market but what i found was
back in the day people just there wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: this open sharing of genetics like there
is today so it really showed up there
[SPEAKER_04]: first it bloomed created a market had the
following and then slowly it trickled down
[SPEAKER_04]: to los angeles and then eventually those
purple varieties got down here and people
[SPEAKER_04]: started working with them and crossing
them and then they have now you know i
[SPEAKER_04]: know cultivators who won't grow anything
unless it's purple that's that okay this
[SPEAKER_04]: is all this is all will grow so um anyway
it's yeah it's just really interesting how
[SPEAKER_04]: you see these different markets and
there's like a legacy of what varieties
[SPEAKER_04]: were first introduced into that market
that still kind of ripples as the market
[SPEAKER_04]: shifts and and now we have full access to
cultivars through the nursery system we
[SPEAKER_04]: can get any cultivar that's available up
and down the state um so yeah i have a
[SPEAKER_09]: quick question when you say purple and
terpenaline you know historically uh
[SPEAKER_09]: outside of the the napro ecosystem we
don't see cultivars that test much higher
[SPEAKER_09]: than right at 20 low 20s maybe 20 thc most
of the purples are dip under 20 and i just
[SPEAKER_09]: wonder if it's the buying habit of the
socal consumer shooting for that 30
[SPEAKER_09]: percent or more so than and same with the
terpenally dominant lines they don't they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't get at it takes some breeding tricks
to get those things up into close to the
[SPEAKER_09]: 30s and maintain that terpene integrity
what do you think about that i think that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's something to be said for that i
think the purple phenomenon has a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: to do with marketing you know and and
certain very successful marketing
[SPEAKER_04]: campaigns behind bigger groups that have
been able to really sell you know i mean
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just crazy you know just the other
day there was you know seed junkies did a
[SPEAKER_04]: drop at blah blah and when in in the
valley and people were lined up overnight
[SPEAKER_04]: camping out waiting to purchase seeds you
know and and i do think you know same with
[SPEAKER_04]: the cookie store every time a cookie store
opens up you know there's lines around the
[SPEAKER_04]: block it's like star wars in 1977 you know
so it's it's far out you know and that's
[SPEAKER_04]: that to me that has so much more to do
with marketing and how far your social
[SPEAKER_04]: media reach goes than it really is about
how desirable those varieties are so and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the challenge you know the purple
is just like like i mentioned on the in
[SPEAKER_04]: our our breeding panel purple is a
beautiful color that people love you know
[SPEAKER_04]: and in attaching that your predisposition
to aromas colors flavor flavors kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: leads you into what varieties you first
try as soon as they become available and
[SPEAKER_04]: it can kind of grab hold of your
preferences in a powerful way like me for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance i don't really like purple
varieties but i love the flavor i love
[SPEAKER_04]: grape i love purple flavors so you know
there's like this battle where like as i'm
[SPEAKER_04]: inhaling and i'm enjoying the smoke i'm
like wow that brings back all these
[SPEAKER_04]: memories of all these different these
different uh you know you remember when
[SPEAKER_04]: you were a kid purple was a flavor back in
the 70s you know you got all your great it
[SPEAKER_04]: was great right yeah i know but it often
was like purple and red and green those
[SPEAKER_03]: are your flavors um so it brings back all
those memories you said that because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not necessarily the same and i
that's exactly the question i had so
[SPEAKER_03]: purple and grape aren't necessarily the
same in cannabis no not at all not at all
[SPEAKER_04]: not to me at least you know a lot of the
great the grapey flavors i get kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: come from where like that that tart grape
skin you know a lot of a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: with the new purples that you're seeing
like see junkie genetics and stuff a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the allure there is that through some
of the breeding tricks they've able to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of turn some of those purples by eye
more of like a gassy limonene dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile when when you're opening
those bags up or you're smelling that it
[SPEAKER_02]: tricks the brain um it's not more of like
that kind of traditional gdp or like uh
[SPEAKER_02]: the grape vape which is a little more
creamy and it's going to remind you more
[SPEAKER_02]: of that great flavor so i see at least in
our area too um most of the people now
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with the purples i mean
traditional market obviously we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just unstoppable the ogs are so
dominant down south um it's starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: it's starting to come up here but mostly
now with those purple crosses with more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the limonene effect a little more of that
gas to it that's we're definitely seeing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of that um in the limonene category in
the cup this year um i want to say at
[SPEAKER_02]: least by i think the our records with sc
labs i think mere scene's the most heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant terpene uh and cannabis tested
throughout the state here and so when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're when we're starting to see these
different terpene profiles with the mono
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes um those different combinations
that's where i'm starting to see these
[SPEAKER_02]: trends happening at least by going terpene
first at the store um it's kind of what
[SPEAKER_09]: i'm seeing with that here and you just
reminded me of a question that mark asks
[SPEAKER_09]: like an hour ago about um seasonal change
in terpene profiles and if you're if you
[SPEAKER_09]: know as you you all know um if you're
growing in a greenhouse you're obviously
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have red shift and blue shift
different types of the year times of the
[SPEAKER_09]: year and that's why a lot of people really
like those depths because they're getting
[SPEAKER_09]: that really intense light for 12 hours and
getting blacked out and um not to spend a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of time here because you need data for
me to show this but i did a can med talk
[SPEAKER_09]: along time ago that is online and i showed
terpene variation across multiple harvests
[SPEAKER_09]: and a single genotype and you know
basically what happens if the if the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: is suffering at all whether it's sunlight
stress mersene starts to take over um it
[SPEAKER_09]: almost seems like it's a stress default um
terpene so it's funny you were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the terpene preservation too um i i
was actually talking to alec about this
[SPEAKER_02]: the other day that we know there some
farmers up here that actually turn to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting at night uh obviously we know
some of those terpenes the monoturpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: they they boil they boil down that lowest
temperature so you're automatically losing
[SPEAKER_02]: these terpenes as they're going off so um
i'm curious to know kind of you know if
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone on the panel has as heard other
people using utilizing that trick or
[SPEAKER_02]: technique as far as terp preservation is
concerned there's a patent for harvesting
[SPEAKER_09]: on a full moon on a certain day of the
month isn't there ryan
[SPEAKER_06]: herbalism come on that's unfair i even if
scott man sam does it it's not fair and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not cool i'm not making this up
herbalism i'm not making this up so on the
[SPEAKER_10]: east coast you know you brought something
up that's interesting that i paid
[SPEAKER_10]: attention to and i've been doing some some
studies on is is our lights a lot bluer um
[SPEAKER_10]: especially when we're growing in in uh
greenhouses out here so we are getting
[SPEAKER_10]: very different expressions from different
varietals um and then to someone else's
[SPEAKER_10]: point when we're harvesting especially
during the fall it's just naturally cooler
[SPEAKER_10]: we're getting different co2 levels where
you know different things are happening um
[SPEAKER_10]: because of the environment and it's
changing um the expressions on all these
[SPEAKER_10]: different varieties that i see versus a
much uh you know more uh you know a 4200
[SPEAKER_10]: spectrum or something like that so it's
we're we're getting a different expression
[SPEAKER_10]: from the terpenes and and also the
cannabinoid expression and then all the
[SPEAKER_10]: way through harvest we're able to keep
things really cool a certain time of year
[SPEAKER_10]: you know if we do light depth usually
june's a little bit different for us out
[SPEAKER_10]: here where it's dry but it's it's still um
it gets hot so um it's just different but
[SPEAKER_10]: but absolutely over the years the fall has
been a key play especially for doing those
[SPEAKER_10]: chems and ogs and sours that's really
where and i think why are sours when we
[SPEAKER_10]: did them well um during the fall they just
they really were a great expression of
[SPEAKER_09]: those particular varietals just goes to
show how important environment is right
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely i was going to say the same
thing because we're also talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology because in the morning
there's a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology in the air in the early
morning and this is why ancient practices
[SPEAKER_00]: of when you're trying to collect sort of
those volatile oils of any types of herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: and ancient herbology tells you you know
before the sun peaks on the horizon is is
[SPEAKER_00]: when anything should be picked for its
aromatic effects and that just goes back i
[SPEAKER_00]: i mean i think thousands of years even
five thousand years in chinese one million
[SPEAKER_00]: years i don't know about that but um it's
uh you know when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: curing we're talking about microbiology
and it is so important i loved you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that cool long dry cure is so helpful for
the stabilization of the microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: during that time and i and i think that
there's a really big role in uh terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation and microbiology so it's it's
sort of a an unknown it's another fractal
[SPEAKER_00]: immersion yeah another fractal that we
have to look at i couldn't agree more it's
[SPEAKER_09]: like and it's also you tie the chemistry
in right like at cooler temperatures most
[SPEAKER_09]: of those aromatic plants have trichomes
trichomes are made out of waxes and fatty
[SPEAKER_09]: acids which when they're colder are
stronger and hold the aromatics in better
[SPEAKER_09]: and then when the sun's out you have the
heat hitting the molecules causing them to
[SPEAKER_09]: turn into a gas and then it's gone and i
found this patent by the way it's uh if
[SPEAKER_09]: you want the patent number the the actual
title is about moon phases it's um very
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting would you guys like to look it
up or do you care yeah yeah put it in put
[SPEAKER_12]: it into the chat and i'll also i'll put it
into the comment section i think you know
[SPEAKER_12]: getting into the the microbiology of the
soil leads perfectly into an introduction
[SPEAKER_12]: uh with peter and you know a bunch of us
have been going deep down the rabbit hole
[SPEAKER_12]: on clubhouse the last couple of days uh
into all of these things that we're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about right now and this is a
perfect time to bring in the microbiology
[SPEAKER_12]: so welcome peter how are you my friend
cool marcus thanks so much for having me
[SPEAKER_13]: um it's uh great to be in this room with
all of you minds you guys uh just sitting
[SPEAKER_13]: here listening man the the minds in here
beautiful and i'm so just like humbled to
[SPEAKER_13]: be in the same room as you guys and your
industry knowledge it's it's amazing i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: like a listener you know in the audience
just blown away by by you guys so um but
[SPEAKER_13]: um yeah jeremy and uh mojave and i've been
having some really interesting
[SPEAKER_13]: conversations uh on clubhouse lately and
one of the things that i thought was cool
[SPEAKER_13]: that we can bring up was the concept of uh
saprophytes which saprophytes are a type
[SPEAKER_13]: of organism which are so important uh for
terpene production and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_13]: production um they're like you know the
frontline workers of the uh of the work
[SPEAKER_13]: that needs to be done in the rhizosphere
to actually increase uh what's called
[SPEAKER_13]: trace nutrient absorption right so what
we're what we have found and i'll give you
[SPEAKER_13]: guys just a little bit of background is uh
in 2019 uh our group consulted for 162
[SPEAKER_13]: large-scale hemp farmers and what we found
was that the trace nutrient absorption
[SPEAKER_13]: your coppers your zincs your your borons
were like the physics or or the foundation
[SPEAKER_13]: of of the necessary absorption in that
rhizosphere to build the different types
[SPEAKER_13]: of terpenes within the profile so it was
uh seen by us that the growers that had a
[SPEAKER_13]: biologically active system with a with a
good amount of of saprophytic organisms
[SPEAKER_13]: and i'll i can go into what those are a
little bit more but those farmers uh were
[SPEAKER_13]: getting like 25 types of terpenes in their
profile and then the the growers that had
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe five types of of good saprophytic
organisms or i'm sorry um that had low
[SPEAKER_13]: amounts of saprophytic organisms were
getting maybe five or six types of
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes and they were all really high so
you'd have like four or five spikes in the
[SPEAKER_13]: profile but then the biologically active
soil would have like 25 different types of
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes but they were more balanced so
you would have like 15 types that were all
[SPEAKER_13]: over like 0.1 versus you know the the uh
the soils that didn't have the saprophytes
[SPEAKER_13]: and so one of the one of the things that i
thought would be cool to talk about today
[SPEAKER_13]: is the um the uh the way that saprophytes
can actually help with powdery and dining
[SPEAKER_13]: mildew so this is this is just a cool
concept and it's just part of nature it's
[SPEAKER_13]: the way that it that it works um and so a
saprophyte is a living organism right and
[SPEAKER_13]: and to understand powdery and dining
mildew what you kind of want to understand
[SPEAKER_13]: is is maybe where it comes from so in in
the soil in all organic material there's
[SPEAKER_13]: this there's this little tiny ball it's
called an oospore and it's like a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bowling ball it's super small it's
microscopic so you got to take your mind
[SPEAKER_13]: and think really tiny right now so this
little oospore is like a bowling ball uh
[SPEAKER_13]: particle inside the soil and inside of it
lives this organism called perinospora
[SPEAKER_13]: which is another which is the scientific
name for downy mildew so no amount of
[SPEAKER_13]: chemicals like if you hit it with methyl
bromide or a systemic fungicide or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever is going to destroy this little
oospore so it's very hard to to to destroy
[SPEAKER_13]: and once you get the correct uh physics
and the and the correct uh temperature and
[SPEAKER_13]: the correct uh moisture levels that little
oospore in the soil it cracks and out
[SPEAKER_13]: comes this this this perinospora this
downy mildew and it begins to just kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: colonize the carbon in the soil right so
what's pretty cool is if you have an
[SPEAKER_13]: abundance of these types of bacteria and
fungi called called saprophytic organisms
[SPEAKER_13]: what they'll do is they can actually grow
on all the carbon and then when that uh
[SPEAKER_13]: that disease that soil-borne pathogen
begins to to colonize and it has the
[SPEAKER_13]: perfect environment it doesn't have any
space because there's all these these good
[SPEAKER_13]: guys that are on all the rest of the
carbon that are basically like having a
[SPEAKER_13]: party on there and they're doing a really
special form of work so what happens is
[SPEAKER_13]: the bat you know the path and he's not a
bad guy but he's a pathogen who just wants
[SPEAKER_13]: to eat to survive right and take and and
and so what this little guy uh does is he
[SPEAKER_13]: tries to get into the party on the carbon
and there's no room for him to jump in
[SPEAKER_13]: there so so biologically speaking he can't
gain traction he can't gain competency now
[SPEAKER_13]: normally what perinospora would do is it
would actually colonize the carbon and
[SPEAKER_13]: then it would actually colonize the the
root and there's another cool little thing
[SPEAKER_13]: in in the soil it's a little worm and
sometimes those little worms called
[SPEAKER_13]: nematodes can actually make holes in the
roots so now what happens is the
[SPEAKER_13]: perinospora that came out of that little
bowling ball will actually go into the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant's vascular system it'll cruise in
through that hole and it'll and it'll get
[SPEAKER_13]: into the glucose and the sugar and it just
has a field day it's like oh man there's
[SPEAKER_13]: all this food and delicious stuff so now
it's traveling through the plant and guess
[SPEAKER_13]: what happens so in a in a in a nutrient
deficient plant uh system what ends up
[SPEAKER_13]: happening is you get this this like this
area where there's a lack of trace
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrients so you don't have your your
borons your zincs your coppers all these
[SPEAKER_13]: amazing you know um minerals that the
plant needs to to really you know produce
[SPEAKER_13]: its full genetic expression and that's
where the the the perinospora will begin
[SPEAKER_13]: to eat and then what happens is is it will
colonize so much that it gets on the top
[SPEAKER_13]: of the soil um and and then like in a
natural environment a big wind comes or or
[SPEAKER_13]: a droplet of rain comes and that can
spread it to the all the other plants
[SPEAKER_13]: right so this is how this guy gains
traction and so what we do as farmers as
[SPEAKER_13]: growers is we actually you know we'll just
figure out organic oils or different
[SPEAKER_13]: things or hopefully um or we'll hit it
with something called a systemic fungicide
[SPEAKER_13]: now systemic fungicides go into the
vascular system of the plant and into our
[SPEAKER_13]: food so what ends up happening is this
this uh chlorinated hydrocarbon just kills
[SPEAKER_13]: not only the perinospora but it kills uh
all the beneficial bacteria that is so
[SPEAKER_13]: crucial to terpene uh synthase enzymes CBD
THC synthase enzyme so so we got to go
[SPEAKER_13]: back to the the the the saprophytes so
this is what's so cool about certain
[SPEAKER_13]: saprophytic organisms so the definition of
a saprophyte is is an organism that eats
[SPEAKER_13]: and digests carbon so think about like
like composting right when we're growing
[SPEAKER_13]: organically the first thing that any
organic farmer does is he um composts his
[SPEAKER_13]: soil for two to three years to get that
soil biologically to a point of competency
[SPEAKER_13]: that it can actually have these natural um
efficacies right so we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_13]: compost to compost 100 million acres we
just don't have the resources the material
[SPEAKER_13]: but we do have enough beneficial bacteria
and we do have enough uh saprophytes in
[SPEAKER_13]: the form of fungi which are also mushrooms
right which is a big a big trending thing
[SPEAKER_13]: right now people are really connecting
with with mushrooms and starting to
[SPEAKER_13]: explore that um which is fantastic it's
it's it's it's this it's this unseen world
[SPEAKER_13]: of life that is the defining factor in
quantifying quality and and producing
[SPEAKER_13]: quality i should say so um so one of the
cool things about saprophytes and then
[SPEAKER_13]: i'll shut up but uh the um the cool thing
about saprophytes is they have these two
[SPEAKER_13]: main objectives right so one of the first
things that they do when they first get
[SPEAKER_13]: into the soil which is which is awesome is
they will um begin to like decompose old
[SPEAKER_13]: carbon so like a plant is trying to place
carbon into the soil right with its roots
[SPEAKER_13]: so as a plant grows it deposits its its
roots in the form of carbon into the soil
[SPEAKER_13]: and these saprophytes will actually go on
it and they begin to um to live in in the
[SPEAKER_13]: symbiotic relationship with the root
exudates that the plant is producing in
[SPEAKER_13]: the form of sugars and carbohydrates so
think of it as like the root is producing
[SPEAKER_13]: like a bead of sweat you know it's like
this it's it's like this little bead of
[SPEAKER_13]: sweat and the saprophytes love to eat
sugars and carbohydrates you know and so
[SPEAKER_13]: do my kids they they love the donuts
sometimes and i give it to them you know
[SPEAKER_06]: try bio-organic that's the point of the
rise of phagy cycle where the endophytic
[SPEAKER_06]: fungi and bacteria enter into the roots
and enter into the plant so it's not just
[SPEAKER_06]: saprophytic fungi that's right entire
totally nod factors right also i think i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to just give it a give it an
overview for the audience to to give it
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of like there's so much diversity
right so much diversity yeah and i think
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can bring it back really easily to
understanding the microbiome of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is really no different than the human
microbiome so what we're feeding the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is the same as what we're feeding our
human digestive system so whenever we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at a balance with say like an oomyces or
some other type of a yeast leaf feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew we have a yeast infection the plant
has a yeast infection it's absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: different than if our own microbiome is
totally out of balance with a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of yeast or or different types of
of aggressive microorganisms that will eat
[SPEAKER_00]: up our beneficials so having a really
well-rounded diet that has a lot you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have sugars that isn't feeding a
lot of those yeasts and mildews is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way that we need to look at our soils
so when our soils have a tremendous amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbon then we are actually drawing and
and composting carbon like peter was just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about saprophytic and saprophytic
fungi and we're also drawing a myriad of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of fungi which is a huge
decomposing raw materials that's why we're
[SPEAKER_06]: raw materials farmers because you can't
stop goodness from coming in yeah and i
[SPEAKER_00]: think that once you you have this sort of
balanced soil then you have a that that
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful clean balanced endophytic system
the same as the microbiome so it's
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting and a high fungaled soil is
what you're saying and we're agreeing with
[SPEAKER_00]: you yeah and as you're talking peter it's
awesome because i'm always drawing which
[SPEAKER_00]: which i always do as my background in
human health i'm always drawing the two to
[SPEAKER_00]: human health and soil and plant and human
health and and how they're so incredibly
[SPEAKER_13]: related so spot on what you said i love
everything you're you're putting out so
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah you guys are amazing uh in what
you're doing i'm i'm so appreciative of
[SPEAKER_13]: your permaculture of the way that you
certify people like it's beautiful i'm i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: humbled to be on the same stage as you
guys you guys are that amazing to me like
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful what you're doing um truly i
love what you're putting down it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly important for people to be able
to get this information everyone on this
[SPEAKER_00]: panel this panel today has been awesome
like totally mind-blowing thank you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: so much every single person on here i've
smoked so many bong hits sitting here just
[SPEAKER_00]: blown away this is really re-sparked
something in me thank you so much bong rip
[SPEAKER_08]: mother lovers well peter if i may there's
also one thing that i think is a really
[SPEAKER_08]: important implication of what you're
bringing up and what josh and kelly were
[SPEAKER_08]: just emphasis yes jeremy yes right now we
we have this massive industry scaling with
[SPEAKER_08]: consultants around the world telling
people with money that the only reliable
[SPEAKER_08]: production model is a mineral salt program
under hid lights with this one size fits
[SPEAKER_08]: all crap one of the exciting things that i
have fought for for a long time and i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: really proud of an organ is that reality
is i think that the organic crop
[SPEAKER_08]: production model finally we can point to
like the rhodale crop trials has been more
[SPEAKER_08]: successful in out yielding out consistency
or more consistently yielding and of
[SPEAKER_08]: course from all the qualitative attributes
performing as a production model on the
[SPEAKER_08]: whole i'm absolutely convinced it's
because of belonging to biology and
[SPEAKER_08]: intentional way participating with biology
encouraging biology i can't pretend to
[SPEAKER_08]: understand all of the biological elements
and in fact i think soil doctor does some
[SPEAKER_08]: great talks about that where you know we
look at the various kind of biological
[SPEAKER_08]: assays and the complexity of being able to
really understand those dynamics and it
[SPEAKER_08]: gets incredibly complex it reminds me of
ryan's hairball earlier but this notion
[SPEAKER_08]: that we can create the conditions by which
biology can flourish and i'm so excited
[SPEAKER_08]: about whether it's rhizophagy or the kind
of overall sort of shield against like a
[SPEAKER_08]: bio shield all pathogen pressure i am
convinced one of the reasons that proof
[SPEAKER_08]: has only 6500 square foot of canopy and
many of the other tier two folks are like
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 000 and we're producing in most cases
two to three times the output it is simply
[SPEAKER_08]: about working with organic cultures and
the organic cultures you know are
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely in addition to all those
qualitative attributes you mentioned so
[SPEAKER_08]: eloquently here in my data i always show
more chemo diversity in a profile and
[SPEAKER_08]: whereas when i contrast that to the
mineral salt products it's more chemo
[SPEAKER_08]: intensity but it's a far less desirable
product i just i would never choose that
[SPEAKER_08]: product if i have the options from a
sensory perspective from a physiological
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective from a spiritual perspective
but yet we continue to see these scaled
[SPEAKER_08]: gardens moving forward without any of this
awareness so it's one of my missions to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to quantify and characterize this
sort of production performance to simply
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to help people who are not as
amazing as all of the humans on this panel
[SPEAKER_08]: who are new and fearful of losing capital
and listening to the kind of prevailing
[SPEAKER_08]: ethos of all the existing consultants they
actually in fact obviously the only way
[SPEAKER_08]: forward is to really create these hyper
biological systems and to tend that with
[SPEAKER_08]: care anyways i so love every it's been
such a joy to communicate with you over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last days by the way really easily
just ask the plant like if we bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into this conversation so often
exactly what you were just saying jeremy
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we're talking about mergers and
wagers and all of these different signed
[SPEAKER_00]: documents and and sops and ips and
everything that's got a letter and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's just so simple to pull up a
chair for the plant and ask her how she
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to be grown ask her you know
how is it that that she would like to to
[SPEAKER_00]: to have medicine prevail inside of humans
on the planet in the relationship that she
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to have with humans and of
course she's going to say that she would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to grow outside under poly culture in
deep soil what plant wouldn't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that and i think that now that we get to
actually match that scientific testing
[SPEAKER_00]: with what the plant's ultimate you know
wants would want to be and in in growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out and also feeding and on to the next
varietals and on to the next generations
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really going to be amazing to match
that science with what we perceive a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we perceive that she would really
like to be involved in and even to see
[SPEAKER_06]: that dynamic happen indoors as well yes
yeah that's that's the trick reading well
[SPEAKER_13]: that's that's the trick that's everything
and that's what you were speaking to
[SPEAKER_13]: jeffrey is or jeremy is is how do we how
do we assimilate the two so many of the
[SPEAKER_13]: top producers that i've been talking to
lately that are that are producing
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis and volume uh indoor you know
there's this huge separation between how
[SPEAKER_13]: can we implement organics how can we
implement a biologically active system in
[SPEAKER_13]: a sterile environment right so there's a
whole business dynamic around this which
[SPEAKER_13]: is listen my investors don't give a shit
uh what the quality is right now we're
[SPEAKER_13]: being purchased on output and so dude if i
if i bring some organics in here i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_13]: fuck up my whole grow and i can't use it
my my investors will cut my cut my funding
[SPEAKER_13]: off and joe's saying yes on this so you
know exactly what i'm what i'm talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about so most of my most of my growers
most of my customers you know that are
[SPEAKER_13]: that are cultivating conventionally um
this is the biggest this is the biggest
[SPEAKER_13]: separation of state right now between the
two between between between redefining
[SPEAKER_13]: quality and and and and and and and being
able to actually do that in a practical
[SPEAKER_13]: way yeah so that's that's one of the
things that we've done with soil balance
[SPEAKER_13]: is we're trying to work with with
salt-based conventional growers primarily
[SPEAKER_13]: by incorporating rhizobacteria that
actually have a certain mode of action and
[SPEAKER_13]: i want to tell you guys this mode of
action because it's far out it's super
[SPEAKER_13]: interesting um and it helps you just kind
of see the relationship that we're all
[SPEAKER_13]: talking about here so eloquently um and
i'll keep it very simple so just
[SPEAKER_13]: digressing back to you know going back
into the soil and and feeling into you
[SPEAKER_13]: know what's happening in there these
saprophytes so just think of them as these
[SPEAKER_13]: tiny little microscopic you know organisms
right and they're growing and they're
[SPEAKER_13]: living and they're feeding on these roots
now these saprophytes can be in
[SPEAKER_13]: conventional operations they can be in
hydroponics they can be in soilless
[SPEAKER_13]: mediums because they only like to live on
the on the roots of plants um compost tea
[SPEAKER_13]: is not going to necessarily do this these
these are not the type of rhizobacteria
[SPEAKER_13]: there are going to be some in there but a
lot of the compost teas that you'll find
[SPEAKER_13]: will have microbes from uh you know crop
residue or animal intestines not
[SPEAKER_13]: necessarily the types of strains that are
going to grow on the root comprehensively
[SPEAKER_13]: and proliferate like crazy and that's what
we need in these sterile environments
[SPEAKER_13]: because what what happens in the sterile
environment sterile environments is people
[SPEAKER_13]: kill the kill the microbes then they
re-inoculate them they kill them they
[SPEAKER_13]: re-inoculate them they kill them they
re-inoculate all in the quest for higher
[SPEAKER_13]: terpene levels so just to kind of break
down how this works um it's very simple so
[SPEAKER_13]: as these rhizobacteria are living on the
root in a hydroponic setting right what
[SPEAKER_13]: they're doing is they're eating the sugars
and carbohydrates that come out of the
[SPEAKER_13]: root all plants create it as they eat
these sugars and carbohydrates they they
[SPEAKER_13]: have to go to the bathroom so they have to
create a waste product right
[SPEAKER_13]: scientifically a microbe waste product is
called a secondary metabolite so this is
[SPEAKER_13]: the way that microbes communicate just
like how terpenes are how plants
[SPEAKER_13]: communicate um microbes communicate by
creating secondary metabolites now a
[SPEAKER_13]: secondary metabolite can be all kinds of
things it could be a chemical it could be
[SPEAKER_13]: an acid it could be uh you know a hormone
an enzyme it could be the saliva in your
[SPEAKER_13]: mouth it could be the the liquid in your
eyes those are all secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_13]: so in in the roots what we want is is a
secondary metabolite that can be in an
[SPEAKER_13]: acid base because what that's going to do
is it's going to micronize and polarize
[SPEAKER_13]: your salt-based nutrients so as you're
cultivating if you're actually able to
[SPEAKER_13]: implement you know these microorganisms
they're going to break down your calcium
[SPEAKER_13]: particle into a size that the that the
plant can actually absorb and like i said
[SPEAKER_13]: if you can absorb iron and copper and zinc
those are the the physics the building
[SPEAKER_13]: blocks that are actually going to uh go
into the terpene production to create this
[SPEAKER_13]: very high level um you know connoisseur
smell and and variance where you've got
[SPEAKER_13]: all these different notes and it seems
like that's where the industry is trending
[SPEAKER_13]: right it's going not so much for the for
the thc but it's going towards the the the
[SPEAKER_13]: craft cultivators like a good ipa and
supporting that in our expansion into the
[SPEAKER_09]: future for sure and um i'd like to just
add that you know when we look at all the
[SPEAKER_09]: different growing techniques um because we
have hydroponics indoors leds all that
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff and it's like you know growing on a
spaceship it's cool that we can do that
[SPEAKER_09]: right but like kelly said the plants
perform by far the best when they're
[SPEAKER_09]: actually in the soil that is connected to
the earth not in a pot um and under the
[SPEAKER_09]: sun and they actually perform better
outdoors than in greenhouse typically if
[SPEAKER_09]: you could keep out the environmental other
environmental factors like if you could
[SPEAKER_09]: just remove the plastic and or or poly and
and have the the plant in the sun in the
[SPEAKER_13]: soil getting the air from earth it's great
true but for the market in california
[SPEAKER_13]: that's not the case the indoor is way
better and it's way tighter the buds are
[SPEAKER_09]: tighter um there you know i i'm based i'm
sorry i'm based in california and i would
[SPEAKER_09]: have to humbly disagree now if you're
talking i would second you dr lewis i'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: california and that's not my experience
here's the thing there's a big difference
[SPEAKER_13]: i think so there's indoor and outdoor
right and everybody who's a cultivator
[SPEAKER_13]: understands this and you can't distinguish
outdoor from indoor me personally an
[SPEAKER_13]: outdoor flower grown in soil with a
taproot you know i mean the taproot is
[SPEAKER_13]: everything and and and growing with the
sun and growing with with the with our
[SPEAKER_13]: mother yeah of course like that's the way
it should be grown um 100 so i agree with
[SPEAKER_13]: you i'm an organic regenerative
agricultural consultant i've been doing
[SPEAKER_13]: that for 20 years so i'm a soil dirt
farmer um not an not an indoor grower at
[SPEAKER_13]: all i don't really know much about indoor
grower growing what i do know is what my
[SPEAKER_13]: customers tell me um and what what they're
doing and to be able to you know try and
[SPEAKER_13]: bring in the organic experience that i
have for 20 years into that type of
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivation is something that's going to
hopefully change the the quality of of the
[SPEAKER_09]: uh of the commodity so you you know you
mentioned your work with daddy mildew i
[SPEAKER_09]: work with um dr jim simon out of rutgers
and helped them breed a downy mildew
[SPEAKER_09]: resistant basil because in the early 2000s
downy mildew practically wiped out the
[SPEAKER_09]: basil industry in south america and north
america and one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_09]: learn there is that outdoor plants grown
have um stronger cuticles taste more like
[SPEAKER_09]: leafy green but if you grow them in the
greenhouse they're softer they're more
[SPEAKER_09]: like uh more edible in general more
palatable um and what i was trying to say
[SPEAKER_09]: about cannabis i didn't say if it were
outdoor i said if or if you could remove
[SPEAKER_09]: the plastic off of a greenhouse and remove
all of the environmental inputs like the
[SPEAKER_09]: wind the dust the rain that product is far
better than a product grown under lights
[SPEAKER_09]: it is 100 correct and it's
indistinguishable i mean i'm gonna tell
[SPEAKER_09]: you right now i know growers that have
been growing in greenhouses for you know
[SPEAKER_09]: decades and their products were always
indistinguishable from indoors and they
[SPEAKER_09]: got sold as indoors so when you look at
quality it's about the chemistry and the
[SPEAKER_09]: bag appeal it doesn't really matter where
it's cultivated but if you want the best
[SPEAKER_09]: best best product it's it's soil sun hands
down from seed period slow cure exactly i
[SPEAKER_13]: i couldn't agree more joe joe really
wanted that yeah i wanted to jump in yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: because i i obviously you're not going to
get a better expression of the plant than
[SPEAKER_02]: full seed full sun in the soil i think
what peter what you were talking about is
[SPEAKER_02]: more like what's commercially viable in
our right and that's just the case like i
[SPEAKER_02]: have right now i have two 166 cultivars
right sitting right next to me right here
[SPEAKER_02]: there's personal use entry mix light entry
full sun ground full sun ground entry and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's indoor these are from some of the
best growers in the whole world in the
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle the outdoor is far by far
distinguishable from the indoor you can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell tell it apart anyone who looks as
many cultivars as we do can it can easily
[SPEAKER_02]: distinguish what's from outdoor and indoor
it's really just about what you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: it from the full cannibinoid spectrum from
that full sun and for us obviously you
[SPEAKER_02]: know looking at all these entries they're
going to have a best in show from what
[SPEAKER_02]: goes up it's going to be a sun grown plant
that wins it's not always about the high
[SPEAKER_02]: thc but with you know craft cannabis by
definition not really being able to scale
[SPEAKER_02]: with the cost of what it costs to produce
a plant and to have the batch sizes makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense for the for the farmers to to have
some of these higher end strains you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they they need they need to have they need
to have a large bulk flower grown so you
[SPEAKER_02]: lose a lot of that craft scale the farmers
that i work with who are working more mix
[SPEAKER_02]: light they have the light depths or they
have some of the smaller outdoor farms
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting much better they just have
more attention to the plant the harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually take the time to harvest
they're not rushing to get to market
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have you know investors they
have to get paid back or they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: having a distributor that's controlling it
and they don't maybe not know how to house
[SPEAKER_02]: it and that kind of ruins the flower so
there's a lot involved with it what
[SPEAKER_02]: actually comes to market i think just the
indoor with the faster turnaround time
[SPEAKER_02]: what's how it's marketed and what's more
commercially viable it sends those mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: messages so you know i'm battling it all
the time and for the other people that
[SPEAKER_02]: might be in the the retailer space it's
either high end or low end there there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no middle anymore you know and most people
don't understand that some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that's on my shelf that might be priced
you know at a lower price brings just as
[SPEAKER_02]: much medicinal value or better value than
some of those higher and indoor strength
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivars so i think there's a lot
more involved with it than just you know
[SPEAKER_13]: how it's grown yeah totally and and
getting back to you know getting back to
[SPEAKER_13]: the essence um you know it all comes down
to costs really and affordability and and
[SPEAKER_13]: the protection right the integrated pest
management so that's one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_13]: things that i that i think is important to
recognize is that if we can really take
[SPEAKER_13]: our time and do and follow some of the
things that like dragonfly earth medicine
[SPEAKER_13]: is doing and really implement try and
implement a lot of those practices
[SPEAKER_13]: especially the the higher amounts of
biology into any operation whether it be a
[SPEAKER_13]: you know your closet or a large-scale
operation really working to to to find the
[SPEAKER_13]: right microorganisms and in my opinion
what are called saprophytes is really the
[SPEAKER_13]: beginning aspect of just improving any
environment because because they're the
[SPEAKER_13]: composters so so we have to get the soil
filled with the right layers of humus
[SPEAKER_13]: which is what saprophytes create then
you're going to have bioavailable
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrients so the conversation keeps coming
back to quality and terpenes and quality
[SPEAKER_13]: and terpenes and that's the future and the
only way to get quality and terpenes is is
[SPEAKER_13]: if you have bioavailable nutrients in a
particle size that the plant can absorb
[SPEAKER_13]: your trace nutrients but that's everything
for for trichome density for trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: strength for for um you know and both of
those things trichome density and strength
[SPEAKER_13]: are indicative of your biology they really
are you can see how much tighter like if
[SPEAKER_13]: you measure a square centimeter of plant
tissue biologically grown and converted
[SPEAKER_13]: conventionally grown in a low biologically
active we have quantified that you will
[SPEAKER_13]: have three to ten times in that square
centimeter of of trichome heads than the
[SPEAKER_13]: non-treated is that total oil production
total cvd and thc synthase enzyme
[SPEAKER_13]: production has been bio-enzymatically
stimulated so the plant's biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_13]: pathways have actually been stimulated by
these microorganisms to to create more oil
[SPEAKER_13]: and a more diverse flavor compounds within
that oil yeah isn't fundamentally one of
[SPEAKER_03]: their one of their main roles is is to fix
nitrogen because the plant doesn't fix
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen itself and these things are the
things that make soluble nitrogen so the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant can make proteins and peptides which
all need to be made those that's the
[SPEAKER_13]: machinery that makes yeah here's a really
crazy thing about the industry mark is
[SPEAKER_13]: that right now what most microbial
companies are doing is they're focused on
[SPEAKER_13]: what a microbe can do on its own so
they're like okay this microbe solubilizes
[SPEAKER_13]: phosphorus or this this makes nitrogen
available or this this does this right but
[SPEAKER_13]: what's really important just like in
strains in cannabis and just like human
[SPEAKER_13]: beings it's not necessarily what one
microbe does but what they produce in
[SPEAKER_13]: combination that make them truly effective
so what we've been doing is studying
[SPEAKER_13]: microbial combinations and the different
secondary metabolites they produce in
[SPEAKER_13]: combination for 20 years and so when you
have a bunch of givers is what i like to
[SPEAKER_13]: call them because there's like these
different kinds of organisms in the soil
[SPEAKER_13]: there's there's the microorganisms that
live on the root that they just give like
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of cannabis providers and growers
just like us right these types of microbes
[SPEAKER_13]: are going to give give give give give give
to the plant to keep it alive because they
[SPEAKER_13]: innately understand that their survival
and the survival of future generations
[SPEAKER_13]: their children is based on how much they
can give to the plant so it's almost like
[SPEAKER_13]: they create this protective biome around
the plant to to care for their children
[SPEAKER_13]: and to care for their planet to care for
future generations right so now there's
[SPEAKER_13]: the other types of microorganisms and
they're not bad they're just a part of the
[SPEAKER_13]: natural system and what they believe
innately is that if they don't eat they're
[SPEAKER_13]: gonna die so they will go and they will
eat your fucking plant that you're trying
[SPEAKER_13]: to grow that you're trying to take care of
so there's there's this there's this
[SPEAKER_13]: system and what i'm talking about is if
you can get the good guys the guys that
[SPEAKER_13]: are giving to your plant that are that are
breaking down nutrients that are giving it
[SPEAKER_13]: all of this love and energy and light and
utilizing you know that then when the bad
[SPEAKER_13]: guys come to the party and they want to
smoke a bowl of you're like dude there's
[SPEAKER_13]: no room for you guys get the fuck out of
here that that's kind of how it is either
[SPEAKER_07]: you mentioned r and d that showed three to
ten times as much uh trichome heads per
[SPEAKER_07]: centimeter whatever well is that published
and i'd love to post it in this room and i
[SPEAKER_13]: i'd be happy to share it publicly sure let
me bring it up right now i can facilitate
[SPEAKER_09]: getting it to you as well from peter sam
oh well we all like to see it actually um
[SPEAKER_09]: because we've been running studies like
this including time course analysis on
[SPEAKER_09]: metabolite accumulation for well over a
decade in cannabis specifically and as
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned we work basil and other culinary
herbs but um can't wait to see that yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: there it is so if you if you wanted to
zoom in on it marcus and just uh well i'll
[SPEAKER_12]: be honest i i can't zoom in on it anymore
because i'm now on my phone driving up to
[SPEAKER_12]: whistler to catch some powder i couldn't
give up past church or powder today so uh
[SPEAKER_07]: i can't i can't do that peter i was
wondering either spend some connection oh
[SPEAKER_07]: sorry please no i have a quick one which
is did the thc or end or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_07]: levels of those varieties increase three
to ten times yes the total oil production
[SPEAKER_13]: went up accordingly to the plant's genetic
dispositions so this was done on hemp
[SPEAKER_13]: right yeah on 162 hemp farms and you know
we had university professors overview it
[SPEAKER_13]: and study it and and it showed the impact
of what a highly biologically active
[SPEAKER_13]: system can do in cannabis culture
cultivation for quality so we're talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about yields as far as the organic versus
the other guys um we hit 5 000 pounds per
[SPEAKER_13]: the acre the conventional fields were
hitting 3000 pounds approximately so we
[SPEAKER_13]: had that as a huge advantage um we
produced approximately 30 more total oil
[SPEAKER_13]: production than than the non-organic the
other thing is that we also sam to answer
[SPEAKER_13]: your question saw some really unique
things in the cannabinoid expression so
[SPEAKER_13]: one of the things that we saw was through
the the biological mitigation of stress
[SPEAKER_13]: induction on the plant in the soil we saw
the the delta it's interesting in the hemp
[SPEAKER_13]: plant we saw delta 9 actually levels
decrease and the cbd levels increased so
[SPEAKER_13]: the cannabinoid increased the cbd but then
in medical marijuana we saw the delta 9 go
[SPEAKER_13]: through the roof so it was just
interesting how the biology just give
[SPEAKER_13]: allows the plant to just achieve its full
genetic expressions um which was
[SPEAKER_13]: interesting so the delta 9 mitigation in
hemp was interesting because what we
[SPEAKER_13]: concluded or hypothesized was that the um
the actual uh stress induced by a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: the plant parasitic nematodes or the uh
the health issues in the soil weren't as
[SPEAKER_13]: present um so for instance in
heterogeneous soils especially
[SPEAKER_13]: conventionally treated where they were
cultivating large-scale cannabis they
[SPEAKER_13]: ended up um you know just putting the
plant right into old tobacco fields in
[SPEAKER_13]: north carolina and this particular plant
instead of like you know the cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: plant instead of when it got hit with all
these health issues this disease instead
[SPEAKER_13]: of like the leaves curling up and you
seeing all the signs like you would like a
[SPEAKER_13]: tomato plant um this plant just said fuck
you i'm not going to give you guys any oil
[SPEAKER_13]: so we got like nine percent cbd and the
delta 9 was through the roof whereas once
[SPEAKER_13]: we mitigated a lot of those stress
inductions that were over the limit of
[SPEAKER_13]: what it would be to trigger a terpene
reaction we ended up seeing um a really
[SPEAKER_13]: high cannabinoid output like 21 cbd and
terpenes that went up as high as three
[SPEAKER_13]: percent in hemp which was pretty
significant what was the thc level in that
[SPEAKER_13]: case so they usually went hot so it was
based on the genetics so the thc would
[SPEAKER_13]: actually go up um based on the again the
the plant's genetic expression so usually
[SPEAKER_13]: they would be up as if the cannabinoids
went up the the thc went up so so you
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't see any differential change in the
relative amounts the only difference we
[SPEAKER_13]: saw was that the delta 9 was lower in the
biologically active treated but the thca
[SPEAKER_01]: was the same i want to throw in a thought
uh to kind of revisit what kelly was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about earlier around the needs of
the plant one of the things i've come to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize and believe is that the genetics
of the plant suggests what it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce but the epigenetics the
environment it's in and how it's treated
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it grows is going to have
something a lot to do with how much of
[SPEAKER_01]: that potential it expresses and uh what
i'm realizing or feeling somehow is that
[SPEAKER_01]: um the the cannabis plant itself because
of is producing this chemistry for its
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to address its situation its place
in the garden or in the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility that it's in or whatever but the
the cannabis chemistry is at least
[SPEAKER_01]: partially shaped by the needs of the plant
like i think certain terpenes might
[SPEAKER_01]: express where a plant is being attacked by
pests and i and i'm just there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful minds in this conversation i'd
really love to hear some thoughts on that
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view of how does the how is that
is that real is it the plant's needs that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually causing the expression of
this chemistry thank you well i know that
[SPEAKER_09]: in the trials that we so napro oversees a
lot of different cultivations right and
[SPEAKER_09]: similar to peter's study we look at same
genotypes across multiple environments
[SPEAKER_09]: within the same identical environment i
mean our data set is definitely the
[SPEAKER_09]: largest in the world for replicates of a
single genotype and or seed hybrids over
[SPEAKER_09]: the course of the past 10 years and the
variations of and experiments where we've
[SPEAKER_09]: altered one thing at a time not not like
having an open field trial where you have
[SPEAKER_09]: all these different environments micro
environments micro micro environments but
[SPEAKER_09]: instead if you know we're using the
identical soil across three rooms the
[SPEAKER_09]: rooms are identical height with length and
in one room we use conventional uh salt
[SPEAKER_09]: and every all the other inputs all the
other pest management everything is the
[SPEAKER_09]: same the other room we use conventional
salt plus a bio stimulant or you know
[SPEAKER_09]: another amendment and generally the trend
is when you use the salts you have higher
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid concentrations and lower and
less diverse terpenoid concentrations and
[SPEAKER_09]: when you use more and more organic
techniques you have lower overall
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid production but higher and more
diverse more body in your terpenoid
[SPEAKER_09]: production so on that part we agree but
the yields are consistently lower with
[SPEAKER_09]: more and more increasing organic
contributions but again you know you can
[SPEAKER_09]: only have so much good and so much bad and
you've got to weigh what you do and and
[SPEAKER_09]: like you were asking about the terpenes
and pests you know there's there's certain
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profiles that attract cannabis
aphids certain terpene profiles that
[SPEAKER_09]: attract the broad mite so it's it's very
interesting because it's almost like those
[SPEAKER_09]: are singing out to the bugs saying hey
come on over here and they they go over
[SPEAKER_03]: there and it's really really neat they're
attracting pollinators right i mean isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: that the reason why the the terpene
profiles are expressed in the plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: begin with it's in an evolutionary sense
is to attract pollinators and it's when
[SPEAKER_09]: pollinated mark well sorry well actually
it's human pollinated and it is attractive
[SPEAKER_07]: out of us because i love the smell okay
but i meant before us humans hey uh mark i
[SPEAKER_03]: just wanted to mention how funny that you
work with jim simon at ruckers um i i also
[SPEAKER_03]: work with him on a completely different
plant too on cadman so yes yes yes the
[SPEAKER_03]: tiger deterrent uh for well for the insect
repellent all right but you don't want it
[SPEAKER_03]: to attract the tiger as it turns out
that's a um an effect that's conserved
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the feline kingdom so so yeah
they they they have the same i guess
[SPEAKER_03]: reaction to these nepeta lactone uh
containing oils so well and you definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: don't want a mosquito repellent that
attracts the cat to come play with you
[SPEAKER_03]: right yeah but i again help us postulate
we've talked about this on hash church
[SPEAKER_03]: before you know why would why would a
plant like cat catnip is just really
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that is again just something that
just intrigues me just in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_03]: evolutionary biology is it attracts cats
and it actually it's an insect repellent
[SPEAKER_03]: but it attracts the i think a certain
lacewing so i think there's a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: insect that it actually attracts but it it
repels most but why would evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: biology end up having such peculiar
properties for one plant well lacewing is
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial it goes after aphids and all
kinds of other pests right right so it
[SPEAKER_03]: attracts actually a good a good insect but
i don't get the cat connection that's what
[SPEAKER_08]: i'm trying to figure out i don't have any
notions there but there's an interesting
[SPEAKER_08]: thing that i've observed in canopies we've
talked about sort of chemistry calling in
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of other allies or adversaries but i
think about one of the most interesting
[SPEAKER_08]: things was when i started getting a lot of
turpinoline dominant varieties into mixed
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivar rooms suddenly varieties that had
no turpinoline expression began to have
[SPEAKER_08]: low level turpinoline presence and even
uptick over time i'm fascinated about voc
[SPEAKER_08]: signaling above ground as well as root
exudates and the fact that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: commingle varieties and clearly have an
impact i even wonder then could you take
[SPEAKER_08]: and i've never done any of this work but
uh you know a certain distilled terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: say limonene and have that same sort of
impact without even the plant present but
[SPEAKER_08]: that that conversation that's happening in
vocs is something we're starting to
[SPEAKER_08]: measure there's these high density sensor
networks there are these little bluetooth
[SPEAKER_08]: enabled devices that pick up the vpd and
co2 and ppfd but now they're adding vocs
[SPEAKER_08]: to them and every three feet in the canopy
at two to three layers you're able to
[SPEAKER_08]: really get this comprehensive view you'll
be very very interesting to then correlate
[SPEAKER_08]: some of the aromatic expression in the
chemo or in the chemotypes within what we
[SPEAKER_08]: observe in the high density sensor network
just trying to observe and listen to in a
[SPEAKER_08]: way that we can analytically quantify that
dialogue there's another thread that i
[SPEAKER_08]: think is so important that josh asked
earlier and that has been kind of floating
[SPEAKER_08]: around a little bit i just think for folks
who might tune in into our talk we're
[SPEAKER_08]: looking to sort of some information about
how do you once you've harvested all of
[SPEAKER_08]: these incredible aromatic compounds get
that to the patient to the consumer in a
[SPEAKER_08]: meaningful way what i see universally in
the oregon and california market and i i
[SPEAKER_08]: do mean a vast majority of all of the
flower that i'm seeing is what the hops
[SPEAKER_08]: growers would call spoiled flower and hops
when i interact with the team at yakima
[SPEAKER_08]: chief hops a lot they just they define a
spoiled hops a variety as something that
[SPEAKER_08]: has lost more than 50 percent of the
aromatic contribution that was analyzed at
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning and then they have really
incredible time trials where they pack at
[SPEAKER_08]: zero degrees and mylar with noble gases
and are able to extend the longevity of
[SPEAKER_08]: the profile that was there at the
beginning it's fascinating contrasting
[SPEAKER_08]: preserving the original expression as
opposed to the distinct effects of curing
[SPEAKER_08]: and all of the kind of transformations
that can occur i think there's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_08]: tension between those two different goals
but in any case i think a vast majority of
[SPEAKER_08]: all of the flower that is being served at
retail dispensaries is currently what we
[SPEAKER_08]: should define as spoiled and there are a
variety of practical strategies that i
[SPEAKER_08]: think can be put into place to really
preserve freshness and that we have a
[SPEAKER_08]: freshness crisis as especially scaled
options came and people stopped putting
[SPEAKER_08]: love into that post-process and few of the
observations i've had is essentially if
[SPEAKER_08]: we're packing at about 10 moisture and we
are able to alleviate that point eight
[SPEAKER_08]: percent water activity mark pretty rapidly
in drying as dr alison justice actually if
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody's not aware of alison's work she's
one of the only people i've heard of who's
[SPEAKER_08]: really done some strong analytics looking
at post-process and she's lecturing about
[SPEAKER_08]: this in a few different podcasts she's
easy to find but the basic gist is that if
[SPEAKER_08]: you can hit point eight percent water
activity botrytis cannot form you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: going to have fungal pathogens so
typically she's advocating more for that
[SPEAKER_08]: aggressive dry for the first 48 hours to
just simply be able to attain that of
[SPEAKER_08]: course that point eight doesn't remain
static over time it does sort of obviously
[SPEAKER_08]: the exterior of the flower is going to
lose moisture first and things will
[SPEAKER_08]: equilibrate as they're in a sort of drying
room together over time or they're packed
[SPEAKER_08]: together so there's ongoing monitoring
that's needed but if you can hit that and
[SPEAKER_08]: then really slow and low kind of carry it
as as far as possible without being
[SPEAKER_08]: concerned about the fungal issues which in
oregon i mean easily the greatest loss of
[SPEAKER_08]: crop value is related to botrytis and
everything we can do to prevent that loss
[SPEAKER_08]: is just a tremendous means of staying
afloat and it's very very important so i
[SPEAKER_08]: think that is one of the most important
pieces but then in terms of packing i do
[SPEAKER_08]: think it's fascinating when i was in a
wholesale buying trip for this company
[SPEAKER_08]: that had helped uh hired me to get
wholesale flower for them which
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially i was able to secure a lot of
exclusively regeneratively grown produce
[SPEAKER_08]: from people like tina moon maid and all
kinds of our peers in northern california
[SPEAKER_08]: last year and what i saw almost
universally was that it was all packed in
[SPEAKER_08]: turkey bags and that we still are using
porous membranes to hold in this
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible sensuous aroma and of course
are losing a lot of that aroma as a result
[SPEAKER_08]: but then there's this issue with mylar
where now do we want another massive waste
[SPEAKER_08]: stream like the gram containers and the
pre-roll containers that literally are
[SPEAKER_08]: littering the streets of portland anywhere
you go it is an absolute you know eyesore
[SPEAKER_08]: fuckery that has to get solved but that so
obviously glass as josh is lifting up is
[SPEAKER_08]: like the fantastic solution and i love
even i don't know how many people are
[SPEAKER_08]: using the sort of fermentation equipment
where you can pump oxygen out of glass
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lid that attaches to any normal
sort of glass jar and then like a wine
[SPEAKER_08]: preserver you sort of pump out the oxygen
and then with removing that oxidative
[SPEAKER_08]: stress and bringing that into potentially
a refrigerated environment but being able
[SPEAKER_08]: to just extend the longevity of that aroma
intensity i think is one of these giant qa
[SPEAKER_08]: qc pieces one more tiny riff here is that
i think that sensory science has been
[SPEAKER_08]: coming up a lot in the clubhouse
conversations recently and that one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: fascinating things is here we may be
according to the hops people overweighting
[SPEAKER_08]: the importance of the analytics obviously
the analytics are unbelievably important
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just that from a product quality
perspective and the average patient and
[SPEAKER_08]: consumer perspective it's so much more
about sort of the experience of of that
[SPEAKER_08]: product and the fact is there's really
amazing technical ways to do sophisticated
[SPEAKER_08]: sensory evaluation that i do not see
generally happening in our space i see
[SPEAKER_08]: individuals practicing that but there's a
woman named lauren salzar who's at new
[SPEAKER_08]: belgium brewery for 10 years who built
this really robust sensory science program
[SPEAKER_08]: that now has gone out to all kinds of
other breweries she's just recently
[SPEAKER_08]: started working in canada and she has some
fantastic podcasts this notion of in order
[SPEAKER_08]: to move from more subjective perception of
effects into a more objective evaluation
[SPEAKER_08]: of sensory using the humeral factory which
i mean we could say that we can detect up
[SPEAKER_08]: to a trillion potential aromas but really
let's just go into the infinite with
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers we can't quantify or characterize
it's and that we don't even have language
[SPEAKER_08]: or will ever have language to describe the
nuance of that kind of vastness but we can
[SPEAKER_08]: take panels of people who are highly
trained to identify their own anosmias
[SPEAKER_08]: which are the things we can't smell well
or at all and essentially through a
[SPEAKER_08]: diverse group over time get pretty
consistent results and talk about that in
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of ways i feel like this is one of
the things that challenges the hegemony of
[SPEAKER_08]: purchasing high thc products to open the
door to all of the moderate potency poetic
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible expressions of the plant that i
think she genuinely wants to be in the
[SPEAKER_08]: world because i keep finding some of the
most aroma intense profiles beneath 20 thc
[SPEAKER_08]: and that ultimately it's like just a
really valuable experience to be cherished
[SPEAKER_08]: but literally can't exist in the wholesale
market i can't sell that product i can't
[SPEAKER_08]: grow that product i will lose every dime
that i put into that product which is
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely horrifying to me if we have an
educated sensory approach that then we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: have a lot more uptake there so one last
bit is that the cultivation classic has
[SPEAKER_08]: data over the last couple of years that dr
80 ray jeremy sackett and myself will be
[SPEAKER_08]: coming forward with shortly that looks at
that population dynamic that's i've
[SPEAKER_08]: already described that one of the cool
findings was that aroma intensity when
[SPEAKER_08]: blinded and randomized was by far the most
important qualitative attribute in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis when blinded and randomized seven
out of ten people would always choose
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties that were under 20 thc that is
exactly the inverse of what's happening in
[SPEAKER_08]: wholesale and now in the new scaling
production environment so i just want to
[SPEAKER_08]: pay an homage to all the sensory
scientists and the people who are working
[SPEAKER_08]: to describe in a pretty objective fashion
that element and then that to
[SPEAKER_08]: counterbalance the amazing analytic work
to ultimately open the door to more
[SPEAKER_08]: product diversity more product enjoyment a
deeper connection to the diversity of the
[SPEAKER_08]: product and not just get stuck in fruit
floral fuel or sort of like massive
[SPEAKER_08]: archetypal sort of descriptions and
missing all of this nuance especially
[SPEAKER_08]: that's coming out of the organically grown
products which i consistently experience
[SPEAKER_08]: as exactly as mark described uh slightly
less cannabinoids potentially although i
[SPEAKER_08]: routinely am getting up to 34 percent
total cannabinoids in many varieties that
[SPEAKER_08]: we're cultivating but in general lower but
more diverse more sensuous more present
[SPEAKER_00]: more evocative few thoughts there yeah
when you talk like that jeremy that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just really in total um alignment with
what exactly what i was saying before with
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're rolling up a chair for the plant
and we're asking the plant what is it that
[SPEAKER_00]: she would like to come out with it is you
know quantifying in all of those different
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions and in that same way we find
that full expression when we put her in
[SPEAKER_00]: deep soil when we put her out in the sun
she is able to have those full natural
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions because her ultimate potential
is fully ripe at the full expression
[SPEAKER_00]: during fall when we have all of the
microbiome in full expression yeah all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things then fall into full harmony
and holistic expression of the plant and i
[SPEAKER_00]: think that that's really important with
with what you're talking about and really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly when you were saying about drying
that is also you know what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: following here on the farm but it's also
what's happening in a natural expression
[SPEAKER_00]: when you let your plants go to full
fruition there's a lot of moisture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air during the fall time and then when you
bring it into a 50 50 or a 60 60 you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get that quick dry and then that
prolonged sort of balance and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the full natural expression
of a good cure so thank you for talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that i think it's naturally
happening as well and dr louis you can say
[SPEAKER_06]: something on this too in a second i was
just wondering that the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_06]: higher and the organic you know or the
regenerative grown and maybe the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids are lower but do the terpenes
make the cannabinoids more powerful i mean
[SPEAKER_09]: i would think ethan russo or someone would
also well you said remember our analysis
[SPEAKER_09]: were with the same gene types when i make
that assertion that lower cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_09]: general and higher and more robust
terpenoids in general that's comparing the
[SPEAKER_09]: same plant to each other in the two
different environments i want to make sure
[SPEAKER_09]: distinct that it's not in overall because
if you have you know something that
[SPEAKER_09]: naturally produces 30 cannabinoids it's
still going to get almost 30 cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_09]: it's just going to be in general a little
bit lower and their terpene profiles be a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit higher and one thing that we
didn't talk about with respect to you know
[SPEAKER_09]: preservation of terpene profile is
genetics has a contribution to how a plant
[SPEAKER_09]: cures one of the biggest problems that we
experienced in the early days of breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: the enhanced flowers which contain the cbd
is that they'd turn gold really fast like
[SPEAKER_09]: it was you know so we were we tried to get
the you know toko for all content up to
[SPEAKER_09]: preserve that shelf life so they stayed a
little bit greener and brighter and more
[SPEAKER_09]: poppy but also some things if you store
them they'll turn they'll kind of start
[SPEAKER_09]: smelling like wine or you know kind of
kind of smell old really fast while other
[SPEAKER_09]: things preserve really well and overall
the best way to preserve anything is as
[SPEAKER_09]: soon as it's dried to just freeze it and
then you pull it out of the freezer a year
[SPEAKER_09]: later it's still going to smell fresh and
gassy like an og but you have to have it
[SPEAKER_09]: sealed properly or else it can collect
water moisture and all those different
[SPEAKER_09]: things and don't open the freezer a whole
lot all that kind of stuff so well and it
[SPEAKER_09]: helps to displace the oxygen doesn't it
mark it does but it depends on the size of
[SPEAKER_09]: your container and the amount of free
space because if you have a really large
[SPEAKER_09]: container that's really full to the rim
and you don't have a whole lot of oxygen
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not going to get harmed a whole bunch
or if you pull out that oxygen it's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to obviously preserve better right and you
know we've done studies where you know we
[SPEAKER_09]: use nitrogen or argon to you know displace
the oxygen but really if it's stored
[SPEAKER_09]: properly the differences are relatively
insignificant it's actually you see in our
[SPEAKER_09]: experience you see more changes in the
thca to thc conversion than you do in the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene nose if you store it properly of
course well i know that in that that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: related but in the potato chip industry
they've they've switched to now blowing up
[SPEAKER_03]: those potato chip bags with nitrogen
because what they find is that the
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen does blanket you know the the uh
i guess the polyunsaturates in potato
[SPEAKER_03]: chips that would degrade and create you
know oxidative degradated smells and other
[SPEAKER_03]: aldehydes and other shit like that i'm
sure it would be the same thing with
[SPEAKER_03]: canvas maybe much to a much lesser extent
well and chips right well think about a
[SPEAKER_09]: potato chip it's like the maximum surface
area possible right so and you think about
[SPEAKER_09]: a bud it's it's all compact typically and
most of the flavor and compounds are
[SPEAKER_09]: protected by the trichome and the cuticle
so you have a couple layers of protection
[SPEAKER_09]: there and actually that's that's one of
the things that we did for a client about
[SPEAKER_09]: eight years ago is started uh they started
using different um the sorbent bags that
[SPEAKER_09]: uh like you know nuts come in and stuff
and they would blow them up and only fill
[SPEAKER_09]: them up about half way so that you
couldn't you could not squeeze it to crush
[SPEAKER_09]: the bud you know whereas with turkey bags
they spin them all down and pull them
[SPEAKER_09]: tight and smash them into duffel bags or
whatever and that really helped with
[SPEAKER_09]: preserving the aroma as well because you
weren't destroying the physical structure
[SPEAKER_09]: that encased the aroma and the molecules
it's funny bringing up the nitrogen we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually switched to nitrogen sealed
packaging about three years ago with our
[SPEAKER_02]: collective it changed the game completely
for us and for me as a buyer um you know
[SPEAKER_02]: we went from housing probably 15 to 20
cultivars to at one point before
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation and i think we had 108
cultivars on the shelf um how long are you
[SPEAKER_03]: how long are you storing those packages so
the things that you're putting under
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen how long are they in storage for
before they're opened up again and are
[SPEAKER_02]: they at room temperature yeah so we keep
those uh we keep those in temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled vault um obviously we just help
with the retention there we've seen and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done studies i mean i've opened cans
that were two years old and still had a
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy nose and um you know we're out of
this world it took a long time to um gain
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumer's trust because they're used
to opening and seeing and being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at that but for us as far as being
able to um create consistency for the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer as far as being able to purchase
enough to have it be stable on the shelf
[SPEAKER_02]: um and also add variety it's was game
changer for us um you know it allows me to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy more um and and also we can house it a
little longer and and we've seen you know
[SPEAKER_02]: um the retention there with the terpenes
it's kind of out of this world it's sealed
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and with the jars you see with
glass and anything else it's still just
[SPEAKER_02]: dissipating oxygen they're not completely
sealed and so uh it's a ticking time bomb
[SPEAKER_02]: and we all know how hard supply chain is
on the retail side most times when i see
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is a sample i feel so bad
for the farmer because by the time it's to
[SPEAKER_02]: me uh like doc louis was saying it's
either um oxidized to a point where maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gold there um those terpenes start to
change to like naradol and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other ones that are a little less
appealing um so it's um it's a race
[SPEAKER_02]: against the clock the whole time for the
terpenes um luckily for us uh we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: situation where we're a little more
vertically integrated i'm allowed to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the farmer directly we have our own
distribution that packages one door down
[SPEAKER_02]: from the retail so once you know um you
know really just having the sops in place
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that um you know your your
dryness levels the moisture the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in the room when you're
packaging is ideal um it all takes place
[SPEAKER_02]: and making sure that you can retain that
terpene i yeah and i was just oh sorry i
[SPEAKER_00]: was just going to say something totally
obvious is uh you know bridging that
[SPEAKER_00]: communication from the farmer to the
packager to the final you know person
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to sell it even the bud tent
is because what what you just said mark
[SPEAKER_00]: about you know different varietals have
different needs and how we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve them and as growers we really
understand that we know that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: certain open varietals might be drying
faster they need to be more upfront and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that we could really pass
on that information all the way to the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tender so that they even know how to touch
it in the very end so i know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really obvious but i love it that we're
even having little drips of conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: here of having that bridging communication
all the way back to the farmer because i
[SPEAKER_00]: think we really have an understanding of
all those different varietals from a
[SPEAKER_00]: different view from the packager and the
distributor of them so i love this i love
[SPEAKER_08]: kelly we were just on the same wavelength
i was just thinking the other part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: connection is when consumers and patients
are going to reach tail and saying gosh if
[SPEAKER_08]: you have that big jar of flour with all of
the breakage on the bottom under lights
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're taking more than a week to go
through that inventory this is
[SPEAKER_08]: disrespectful to the farmer to the plant
to the whole equation and that there needs
[SPEAKER_08]: to be some reconciliation around how even
that last point in the chain works i know
[SPEAKER_08]: at pharma i created a russian nesting doll
strategy where it had to be a series of
[SPEAKER_08]: progressively smaller containers all to
the point where it never would we expose
[SPEAKER_08]: the flower to the environment if it wasn't
an amount we were going to go through in
[SPEAKER_08]: that day an interesting i don't know if
everybody knows but oregon is actually the
[SPEAKER_08]: only sort of deli style market where we
don't have forced prepackaging which was a
[SPEAKER_08]: battle that i won at the olcc rulemaking
advisory committee there was many i lost
[SPEAKER_08]: but i did get that unfortunately in the
pandemic that's kind of out the window but
[SPEAKER_08]: the idea that you can connect people to
aroma and actually view and connect with
[SPEAKER_08]: the product is a really important part of
i think the selection process but back to
[SPEAKER_08]: i think the russian nesting doll strategy
is one element another thing that we've
[SPEAKER_08]: tried i've ordered pickle jars off of sort
of like alibaba that are stainless steel
[SPEAKER_08]: that have clasps that can fit a half pound
and enough room to then we've used a mixed
[SPEAKER_08]: gas i was in chile working with my friend
pablo mendez at dia can three years ago
[SPEAKER_08]: and they had some really interesting food
scientists and mark or dr louis i don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know if you might know more but their
strategy was to have an 80 20 80 nitrogen
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 co2 and they claimed that that addition
of the co2 actually helped to suppress
[SPEAKER_08]: fungal pathogen over time and that there
was a lot of food packing that was using
[SPEAKER_08]: that solution in south america so we just
adopted that i haven't seen a lot of data
[SPEAKER_08]: to support or substantiate that but then i
like this idea of packing small increments
[SPEAKER_08]: we wanted to create a reuse program and
buy these containers and then have a
[SPEAKER_08]: sanitation process where we would drop
only in 228 gram increments all so like
[SPEAKER_08]: mountain of these like containers into the
retails and then request those containers
[SPEAKER_08]: back unfortunately it was literally i kept
running into compliance issues and the
[SPEAKER_08]: sanitation issue was a big cost in terms
of getting the kind of equipment that you
[SPEAKER_08]: need to clean that it's just that we're
really in this conundrum right now with
[SPEAKER_08]: packaging and thankfully actually one
other little highlight is that in the last
[SPEAKER_08]: year for the first time if you're aware of
sauna packaging there's a few people who
[SPEAKER_08]: are working with like you know compostable
packaging with recycled ocean plastic with
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred percent post-consumer stuff and
you know it's there's at least some
[SPEAKER_08]: options that just in the last year are now
cost effective maybe it's only like 2x the
[SPEAKER_08]: cost of the tube tube that is the crap
that fills the landfill but as companies
[SPEAKER_08]: are starting to feel pressure from
consumers that are informed my hope would
[SPEAKER_08]: be that nobody is going to be able to make
a bottom line decision with regard to this
[SPEAKER_08]: unbelievable waste stream that the
industry has just created yeah i think
[SPEAKER_10]: what you're illustrating is something you
know for me on the east coast it's it's we
[SPEAKER_10]: don't have this this luxury of deli style
or the bodega style um you know experience
[SPEAKER_10]: so to speak it's it is a cpg world so we
have to look at the supply chain and then
[SPEAKER_10]: we have we have ratios of medical versus
rec that we have to keep at all times and
[SPEAKER_10]: it just forces us in a regulatory way to
have to to to package you know we chose to
[SPEAKER_10]: go with glass i chose to with you know to
induction seal and to try to do the best
[SPEAKER_10]: that i could but i don't you know like
you're illustrating we just we have so
[SPEAKER_10]: many things we have to look at what is
enough to package how many batches do we
[SPEAKER_10]: really go through a day do we really need
to have all this packaged up um you know
[SPEAKER_10]: all really valid questions and i think you
know from myself it's it's really hard
[SPEAKER_10]: because i see a totally different product
behind the scenes that i see my customer
[SPEAKER_10]: walk away with and it's just a really hard
thing to go through because yeah we're
[SPEAKER_10]: we're we're essentially packaging up a you
know dying flowers you know things that
[SPEAKER_10]: are changing composition as it's sitting
there right before our eyes so it's it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: really tough tough thing you know i'm
always looking at new containers like i
[SPEAKER_10]: have this galaxy container here while i
really love where their head's at i want
[SPEAKER_10]: to see it glass you know like it's got a
seal and has this idea where you can you
[SPEAKER_10]: know snap it shut so you know we have our
you know our cr right here so it's there's
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of people thinking about this but i
think we just you know we've got to keep
[SPEAKER_10]: pushing to get glass we've got to get keep
pushing to get reusables here we go nice
[SPEAKER_10]: so yeah so if yeah and what you're talking
about um jeremy is amazing i use those in
[SPEAKER_10]: the lab for any oil that i've made it's
like immediately i'll do that to preserve
[SPEAKER_10]: to try to try to um then put that in
refrigeration or a you know a freezer a
[SPEAKER_10]: freezer if you will so i think we're in
this conundrum right now where we have
[SPEAKER_10]: this amazing behind the scenes uh efforts
happening that are then like you're
[SPEAKER_10]: illustrating jeremy just quite simply
being uh being not uh representing
[SPEAKER_10]: presented at a at a retail level so it's
it's really heartbreaking in some respect
[SPEAKER_10]: and i know i go through that with my hash
all the time where it's you know i can
[SPEAKER_14]: only do so much it's a cold chain item you
know yeah it's a huge conundrum because we
[SPEAKER_14]: at the consumer level we see more people
just putting things in a jar whereas the
[SPEAKER_14]: jar is this big and the product's this big
so you're left with an overabundance of
[SPEAKER_14]: you know decomposition due to the oxygen
then that's left in there and how few and
[SPEAKER_14]: i think joe can probably attest this is
how few people are actually doing any type
[SPEAKER_14]: of nitrogen spiking or that 80 20 that you
were talking about jeremy which i think is
[SPEAKER_14]: is very fascinating because some people
were playing early on with nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_14]: they were concerned of degradation and
there was some degradation depending on
[SPEAKER_14]: ratio so i love the concept of the 80 20
but again still the consumer in california
[SPEAKER_14]: majority of what they get is very dry very
unfortunately over oxygenated products so
[SPEAKER_14]: that they don't get the natural
representation really depending on when
[SPEAKER_14]: that comes to market of what that flower
expression fully is and it's a shame
[SPEAKER_02]: you're 100 correct it's um it is a shame i
mean you just think about the supply chain
[SPEAKER_02]: and how many cooks are in the kitchen
right you have you have to bring it into
[SPEAKER_02]: from the you know the cultivator to
distribution then depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution then you have to schedule it
with a lab then you have to wait for the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab to come then the lab touches the
flower then it goes back into quarantine
[SPEAKER_02]: then it comes out of quarantine so you're
getting touched and moved over from
[SPEAKER_02]: different climates in different areas
throughout the whole entire process and
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately not everyone um as is a good
fortune as we are to have been vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated you know there's a lot of
people that just don't have that and so
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to tell that story um like you
guys were talking about earlier of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and of the cultivators you know it's
really about establishing those
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships and and really trying to get
that flower to market where you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it the true representation of what
that plant's supposed to be um it is
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrating especially with taxes uh in
the state to see these eighths go out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door where yeah you do half the jar three
a quarter of the jar is full you have all
[SPEAKER_02]: the air in there you have the tax you open
it up and it's uh it's gone it's dry it's
[SPEAKER_02]: dust you can't even roll a joint and so
yeah it's a shame um i don't think a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the growers who are just getting
purchased out they don't even get they
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't see what their flower looks
like on the end result and uh so really
[SPEAKER_14]: it's just that battle against the clock on
top of that it's you know and i think this
[SPEAKER_14]: is a terrible injustice you know there's
four universities here in the united
[SPEAKER_14]: states that teach packaging and one's here
at san jose state university and so they
[SPEAKER_14]: actually have a nitrogen infusing machine
right there in the classroom just to show
[SPEAKER_14]: them how they actually do coffee and we
were discussing that literally a decade
[SPEAKER_14]: ago on infusing that with canada so i mean
there's four universities here people so
[SPEAKER_14]: if you contact san jose state university
they have over a thousand students that
[SPEAKER_14]: actually have uh that are in the market
right now they can find your properly
[SPEAKER_14]: biodegradable or secondary use uh
unrecycled products it's just it's going
[SPEAKER_14]: to cost more than that's the reality but
the consumer has shown that they will pay
[SPEAKER_14]: more if they know a product is quality and
sound and even packaged in quality so
[SPEAKER_14]: there needs to be an education so that
more manufacturers and distributors
[SPEAKER_14]: actually make that investment so that the
consumers can benefit from it otherwise
[SPEAKER_14]: we're left with tons of trash and not
including cartridges at tnl so i
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciate one of the things you just
brought up was that the negative
[SPEAKER_08]: impressions on nitrogen packed cannabis in
the oregon early rec market we saw these
[SPEAKER_08]: survivalist tins that had packed eights
and there was like some big ip deal where
[SPEAKER_08]: you had to pay a lot of money to use that
technology but a lot of mine is i think
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the issues that we saw was people
simply weren't measuring moisture with
[SPEAKER_08]: like a moisture analyzer or getting
consistently correct 10 and if they were
[SPEAKER_08]: packing just a little bit over moist then
you know we seal it you or unseal it you
[SPEAKER_08]: get this moment of you've got the nose but
then the product is crap and we saw a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of bad brand impressions exactly but now
that we're getting the moisture really on
[SPEAKER_08]: point and packing in that way i am seeing
absolutely benefit from suppressing that
[SPEAKER_08]: oxidative force there's one other quick
trial i just wanted to mention that's
[SPEAKER_08]: happening right now that i think is
fascinating ethan has been coming down to
[SPEAKER_08]: proof and we're doing this trial on a sort
of folk cryo it's very much this is a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of an aside but i think very
related it's all about preserving these
[SPEAKER_08]: attributes that we see at the production
then hopefully getting it all the way to
[SPEAKER_08]: the end point essentially he's made a
freezer that is a chest freezer or excuse
[SPEAKER_08]: me it's like a cooler that we have dry ice
on the bottom a metal vessel we put the
[SPEAKER_08]: flour on top of that's conductive and then
a metal tray on top with dry ice above it
[SPEAKER_08]: then the cooler has a spigot and the
spigot is left open and it creates a
[SPEAKER_08]: convection and it is like a very cheap way
to get to a liofilization like process we
[SPEAKER_08]: took fresh harvested plants we immediately
put the fresh harvested plants in the cryo
[SPEAKER_08]: chamber then we did a very brief dry of
the fresh material then put that into a
[SPEAKER_08]: mechanical separator we have lab results
from light scale labs for the flower
[SPEAKER_08]: before it was keefed the flower after it
was keefed and the keef we did that
[SPEAKER_08]: process and now we're contrasting it in
the second wave with my my typical like
[SPEAKER_08]: technical drying process and we're doing
the exact same sort of three points of
[SPEAKER_08]: data the first thing that we saw was a low
yield of course because we actually did it
[SPEAKER_08]: too short of a dry and didn't have a very
hashy plant and there was a few variables
[SPEAKER_08]: there but what we saw was remarkable the
exact terpenes that were in the flower at
[SPEAKER_08]: the same ratios were in the cryo keef and
even when i'm running normal keef process
[SPEAKER_08]: i do not see that i see variation uh
whether we're seeing degradation of mono
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes or other elements that just seem
to have moved around we were able with the
[SPEAKER_08]: freshly harvested plant to really really
secure that and i do think hash is one of
[SPEAKER_08]: the answers like the most ancient answer
to that preservation of this product that
[SPEAKER_08]: creates a shelf stability with this like
incredible rind and there's this wisdom in
[SPEAKER_08]: that process that i still feel is very
underrepresented in this freshness
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation but i really love flower and
i want people to see the flower as we do
[SPEAKER_08]: these unbelievable passionate massive
expressions and i think we have some ways
[SPEAKER_04]: to go yeah well if you think back you know
10 15 years ago when you walked into a
[SPEAKER_04]: health food store all the essential fatty
acids and the probiotics were still just
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting on the shelf and you know like my
my old co-op they didn't keep it so cold
[SPEAKER_04]: in there you know because they were
running on a budget it wasn't like going
[SPEAKER_04]: to vons but then over time we all started
to demand that you know our probiotics and
[SPEAKER_04]: essential fatty acids needed to be
refrigerated and if and then you saw for a
[SPEAKER_04]: while they had some of them still on the
shelf and then some manufacturers who were
[SPEAKER_04]: really adamant that this product has to
stay in the cold chain all the way through
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing shipping and then eventually
retail and then we you know as consumers
[SPEAKER_04]: we started we got more educated and then
we only bought the probiotics that were in
[SPEAKER_04]: the refrigerated section you know and
obviously there's some that are more shelf
[SPEAKER_04]: stable and some that are more you know
dependent on temperature and all that so
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it's really about the the cold chain
you know i was talking to a cultivator the
[SPEAKER_04]: other day about some products that they
had me sample and you know i was trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: be polite and just the turps were a little
low and i was asking him about why his
[SPEAKER_04]: turps were a little low and i looked at
the coa and the water activity level was
[SPEAKER_04]: very low and he said straight out he's
like look i can't control what happens
[SPEAKER_04]: when when this flower leaves my farm and
we've had big issues with mold and
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes it sits through the manufacturer
i mean in the distribution then it sits at
[SPEAKER_04]: the lab by the time it's tested we don't
really know what they're testing so to
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigate that they they bring the water
activity low below 50 which is you know at
[SPEAKER_04]: serious risk for terpene loss obviously
depending on your your your profile but
[SPEAKER_04]: that's their fear they're just like look
like you said jeremy the biggest one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the biggest losses for for farmers is is
failure on testing so i was also wondering
[SPEAKER_04]: you know it's anyone hurt anyone using
oxygen absorbers in their packaging i
[SPEAKER_04]: never see oxygen absorbers in cannabis
nearly as much as i do in other food
[SPEAKER_08]: products i am mojave i've i've been
deploying these food grade oxygen
[SPEAKER_08]: absorbers there's an issue where if you
have too much of course they get hot
[SPEAKER_08]: they're creating heat in a small
environment it's a nominal amount of heat
[SPEAKER_08]: i'm not overly concerned but that's the
primary consideration i typically i my
[SPEAKER_08]: ideal process was the rigid lightproof
container airtight packed by hand then
[SPEAKER_08]: filled topped off with gas not a
scientific process for nitrogen sealing
[SPEAKER_08]: just simply literally running the the gas
for a count and then packing with about
[SPEAKER_08]: two oxygen absorbers per 228 grams that's
been essentially where i've seen the best
[SPEAKER_08]: uh sort of shelf stability of some of the
more nuanced profiles one tiny thing
[SPEAKER_08]: mojave you missed this part about
terpenoline there was this whole riff in
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning that was so like part of
your soul and one of the things i think
[SPEAKER_08]: about that's fascinating in my vault when
i have astral works which is a terpenoline
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant type two it's been there like we
couldn't sell it when we were first
[SPEAKER_08]: growing it because people would not buy a
six percent thc profile but it lasted in
[SPEAKER_08]: the vault for two years two years later
it's still the terpenoline was so
[SPEAKER_08]: remarkably stable it was a bright floral
intense note i mean it was in a
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature controlled situation like that
but there's no other product i have that
[SPEAKER_08]: had that longevity or rather any other
profile that i've seen that has had that
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of longevity it's a fascinating thing
that it's so i wish dr louis had not i
[SPEAKER_08]: left because i am fascinated about that
stability and i don't know if even mark
[SPEAKER_03]: might have information yeah so so maybe
it's a sacrificial scavenger like maybe it
[SPEAKER_03]: scavenges oxygen with time and so if there
is any uh infiltration of oxygen into the
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging the high terpenoline content
would react with that remember that i yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: what we were saying earlier jeremy and i
don't know if uh mark kind of picked up on
[SPEAKER_03]: the question which was that um terpenoline
if it oxidizes makes terpenol and and
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on where those double bonds are
in the molecule because these are all
[SPEAKER_03]: isomers of of limonene you're right and
and and so when these are made in a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: you're kind of in some thermodynamic well
which is that okay you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: limonene you get a little bit of
terpenoline but i i think terpenoline
[SPEAKER_03]: oxidizes on curing to terpenol and you
know again i don't have any data to
[SPEAKER_03]: support that but you just look at the
structure and you say well it wants to be
[SPEAKER_03]: an aromatic ring now psimine is the
completely aromatic ring with a methyl
[SPEAKER_03]: group on one side and an isopropyl group
on the other but when you have two double
[SPEAKER_03]: bonds like you do in terpenoline that
wants to do chemistry and it wants to do
[SPEAKER_03]: chemistry with oxygen and if it does
chemistry with oxygen i think it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene null so it'd be interesting to
look in that sample and see if you see a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of terp your terpene all spike
i want to measure that i will do exactly
[SPEAKER_08]: as you've said one question is i've never
smelled a standard of terpene all only
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenoline isolated have you smelled that
and would you describe them as relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty tight or one's a little more kind
of like i guess i would call it less
[SPEAKER_03]: purely and more nutty i i nutty isn't the
right word it's just it's got kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a a cinnamon more like a caraway but less
like a cinnamon but i i wouldn't you when
[SPEAKER_10]: you say i i have some degraded it gets
rounder yeah this is exactly what we were
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to talk about in the other day in
clubhouse and we just we diverted too well
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes are a language unto themselves
you can't put let me grab some actually i
[SPEAKER_10]: have some degraded terpenes let me i'll be
right back you can't necessarily put a
[SPEAKER_03]: word to it so again like when i think
about like so so terpene terpene all is
[SPEAKER_03]: less gassy more nutty uh a terpenoline to
me anyway smells gassy smells like and and
[SPEAKER_03]: i can't really smell the difference
between it and some of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: monoterpenes and certainly limonene smells
completely different but limonene is is
[SPEAKER_03]: very shallow citrus where valencine that
other um sesquiterpene we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the other day has a much more fuller
bodied orange kind of you know bottom note
[SPEAKER_03]: to it um one's the contra bassoon and the
other's the piccolo flute you know what i
[SPEAKER_03]: mean in the orchestra so they just have
different frequencies as well as the
[SPEAKER_03]: different volumes and i think what was
really interesting in in those graphs that
[SPEAKER_03]: mark was showing earlier is that one
osamine dominant thing you know osamine is
[SPEAKER_03]: very is like it's kind of like mercine
it's very fleeting it's going to evaporate
[SPEAKER_03]: and depending on again however well that
stuff is cured how well the the uh the the
[SPEAKER_03]: bud is grown to begin with uh you might
see that pico go up and down quite a bit
[SPEAKER_10]: so mark it really it's quite it has this
like mint this is from jack harer this is
[SPEAKER_10]: very it has a mint kind of vibe to it and
it's very round like it just has this like
[SPEAKER_10]: soft mint and then you can kind of like
just kind of barely smell the the jacky
[SPEAKER_10]: trepinaline uh sharpness in there and the
very touch end of it really back end of it
[SPEAKER_10]: though yeah not nearly as bright as no
it's it's really odd i mean it's i but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so you're smelling cannabis derived
terpenes not the pure ones right yeah just
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis drive so there's more going on
here right but it's a dominant right it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole different body as soon as you
combine them with other right it's a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: different thing right right still
beautiful it's so it's so no i'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: saying it's not beautiful i bet you it's
much better than smelling the mono
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes but the mono terpenes are
overpowering and they don't really have
[SPEAKER_03]: the full bodiness that that a cannabis
profile of terpenes would have so mark i
[SPEAKER_10]: was i was looking at beta osamine an alpha
mass osamine do you do you know the
[SPEAKER_10]: distinct differences between the effects
of those two um because i really haven't
[SPEAKER_10]: really found any definitive no and i think
what's even crazy with anything definitive
[SPEAKER_03]: about it i i don't know this for a fact
but aren't those two forms of osmium
[SPEAKER_03]: interconvertible yes they are yeah so it's
like one's a cis and the other one's a
[SPEAKER_03]: trans double bond and if you stare at them
cross-eyed they kind of interconvert so
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah mother nature you know playing with
her tinker toys yeah i mean you could
[SPEAKER_03]: really you know move the atoms around and
make different molecules and it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so crazy again how sophisticated our
olfaction response is in being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: detect slight differences in say you know
those those molecules in these in these
[SPEAKER_12]: fragrant mixtures mother nature playing
with her tinker toys that is the best
[SPEAKER_03]: thing i got out of this whole thing today
it's about time i did something useful
[SPEAKER_03]: well i i think the discussion with mark
was just great marcus so thank you so much
[SPEAKER_03]: for getting him on and and mojave it's
great to have you on here we need to have
[SPEAKER_03]: you on here more often you know our uh
that um clubhouse app is just we're it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just off the hook right i mean we get a
certain critical mass of people in a room
[SPEAKER_03]: and before you know it it's just like yeah
a bunch of stone people talking about our
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite subject how long can that go on
right our spouses don't like it at all
[SPEAKER_03]: they think there's a hash church that
happens every night yeah exactly true
[SPEAKER_04]: story yeah no we're it's like uh it's like
uh building the new religion of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: it's all coming together the big that the
disciples are all gathering and it gets a
[SPEAKER_12]: little hot in a good way it's powerful
yeah that's a good way of putting it um my
[SPEAKER_12]: young son will you know he'll be like dad
is it hash church again freaking cannabin
[SPEAKER_14]: nerds in there fucking wanting to know
everything about pot geez i cannot believe
[SPEAKER_03]: this shame on you all i i can say though
with a with a fondness marcus that my wife
[SPEAKER_03]: knows the tone of your voice and just can
hear like down the hall and says oh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: marx on hash church i can hear bubble man
talking it's kind of like your your voice
[SPEAKER_03]: has been uh a very welcome vibration in my
household for many years now uh we'll give
[SPEAKER_12]: thanks brother right back at you all of
you guys uh you know super amazed and
[SPEAKER_12]: stoked for the conversation today and how
deep it went i felt bad that we were so
[SPEAKER_12]: deep in it we weren't sort of able to say
goodbye to those who had to drop off so we
[SPEAKER_12]: uh ryan lee and joe sullivan and uh we had
uh why am i spacing uh dr mark lewis um
[SPEAKER_12]: and and anyone else that's no longer in
the room i'm on my phone now and i'm not
[SPEAKER_12]: uh able to really touch it so i can't see
who's in the room and who's not in the
[SPEAKER_12]: room but uh great great episode guys i
think else yeah thank you marcus and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us and yeah it would be nice to uh do
more of these uh and i suppose clubhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: is the platform for the moment yeah peter
thanks for sharing that manuscript too i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: really enjoying i'm reading that and and
at the same time it's it's so fascinating
[SPEAKER_03]: to read so thank you for that can we share
that like can i upload that like like the
[SPEAKER_03]: hash church um facebook page or something
i think i could share a pdf there totally
[SPEAKER_13]: man that'd be an honor that'd be okay
awesome yeah it looks really cool i mean i
[SPEAKER_03]: i think as more studies like this come out
i think they're really going to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: power to regenerative growing right i mean
when it actually makes a yield impact and
[SPEAKER_03]: people can understand the economic impact
that it has that i have this field
[SPEAKER_03]: producing this and this field only
producing this what's the difference yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so it's a it's real data this is
fantastic work thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_13]: sharing yeah mark thank you for
appreciating that and checking it out man
[SPEAKER_13]: thank you so much for doing that for me
like brother thank you you're such a class
[SPEAKER_14]: act now blame it on garcia i blame
everything on jerry why not no seriously
[SPEAKER_14]: it's great to see dr lewis in here earlier
uh he and i went through the uh the first
[SPEAKER_14]: uh dutch masterclass together back in 2011
uh with dr hazekamp there in the
[SPEAKER_14]: netherlands so that was a fascinating you
know dive down the rabbit hole of
[SPEAKER_14]: understanding the uh whole dutch uh system
and providing and if any of you have the
[SPEAKER_14]: opportunity to do so i know dr hazekamp
does those once a year or so and uh it's
[SPEAKER_14]: just a fascinating deep dive into a
country's legal cannabis market we
[SPEAKER_14]: actually have to go to the you know better
cans grow and actually check up everything
[SPEAKER_14]: even to go to you know a pharmacy where
they buy it in bulk and actually
[SPEAKER_14]: distribute it um you know to patients
directly so um yeah duck it's good to know
[SPEAKER_14]: that dr lewis is doing good things and
still continuing on and being awesome he
[SPEAKER_12]: was a great addition yeah i think i think
we'll see him more often for sure if you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys ever get a chance um marks um uh 2018
emerald cup um talk is really great he
[SPEAKER_04]: does a good a great powerpoint and showing
why there's a there's a variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis for everybody he goes to this
kind of timeline of the soccer mom trying
[SPEAKER_04]: various types till she finally lands on
what works for her and it's just it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: a great talk it's a it's a great example
of how our supply chain isn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: addressing all the potential consume
consumers that it could you know um so
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah because kudos to mark if i can get
access to that and i can ask you know
[SPEAKER_12]: either someone through the emerald cup
side through tim or you know right through
[SPEAKER_12]: mark lewis if he has a copy of it i would
for sure post that up on my youtube
[SPEAKER_04]: channel for the audience yeah it's
definitely out there i i know i've seen it
[SPEAKER_04]: online it might be on the emerald cup it
might have been on their emerald cup site
[SPEAKER_13]: or it might be on youtube we should reach
out and ask him hey uh everybody colin and
[SPEAKER_13]: uh and uh mojave you know what's really
cool is that we the three of us actually
[SPEAKER_13]: get to uh fucking hang out with like the
founding fucking fathers of the church
[SPEAKER_13]: right now some of the founding fathers so
i for one feel like humbled to be here
[SPEAKER_13]: with like 18 and mark and wade and sam
these are like the fucking these guys are
[SPEAKER_13]: like the guys that created hash church and
so much fucking gratitude to you guys for
[SPEAKER_13]: that and having people like us to to share
with you guys 100 man you guys have i mean
[SPEAKER_04]: the hash church as a platform has done a
lot for cannabis it's done a lot for
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivators breeders manufacturers you
know everything it's just been a
[SPEAKER_04]: invaluable resource over the years and you
know it is an honor to be here sharing the
[SPEAKER_14]: space thank you that goes to marcus he
created it and invited us all in you know
[SPEAKER_14]: so uh if it hadn't been for him you know
he's the man so thank you marcus yeah big
[SPEAKER_03]: love to you through that and his spouse
lets him do it and the tolerance of his
[SPEAKER_14]: kids for allowing him to continue to yeah
he takes family time time out of his
[SPEAKER_03]: family day you know so we all sleep eight
hours right we all work eight hours and
[SPEAKER_03]: then eight hours for our family he takes
that eight hours out of his family day and
[SPEAKER_03]: unselfishly spends it with all of us so
thank you very much marcus and uh hey
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody go easy on the man just because
he decides to do clubhouse because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: easier to access etc doesn't mean you have
to give him a whole bunch of guv you know
[SPEAKER_14]: uh we we do this out of love this is all
volunteer so you know we just do it
[SPEAKER_14]: because we want to share the knowledge as
well but you know don't get all up in
[SPEAKER_14]: marcus's grill just because he's unable to
do a hash church you know uh go easy there
[SPEAKER_14]: kids that's all i'm saying we do what we
can when we can and we appreciate when
[SPEAKER_14]: we're here but we can't do this every
single day you know that's the reality but
[SPEAKER_14]: sometimes we can on clubhouse so you know
go easy yeah join clubhouse if you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: want to get in on on the conversation it's
always open to everyone it's because of
[SPEAKER_12]: each other yeah it's clubhouse is actually
not open to everyone it's only open to
[SPEAKER_12]: iphone users that was the point of
contention but i do appreciate you
[SPEAKER_12]: mentioning that etienne because uh yeah we
took a little bit of gruff there yeah and
[SPEAKER_14]: you can also do it on the ipad too but
hopefully they'll expand onto you know
[SPEAKER_14]: other platforms because it's expanding
quickly and largely you know because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: an accessible platform for everybody and
it's uh it's mobile and we can you know
[SPEAKER_14]: jump on whenever as well as jump off
whenever whereas we got a specific time
[SPEAKER_14]: and date that we're trying to see here so
you know uh if you get the opportunity
[SPEAKER_14]: people try clubhouse it's worth a shot you
know if you're unable to be patient it's
[SPEAKER_14]: coming soon and join us on a hash church
here when you can much love awesome well
[SPEAKER_12]: what a great episode today i want to thank
everyone for uh just coming and sharing
[SPEAKER_12]: because i'm driving i'm not going to go
through the whole list of incredible
[SPEAKER_12]: people but you all know who you are i'll
make sure i add it all into the comments
[SPEAKER_12]: what an episode for like no mention
whatsoever no no promotion of this episode
[SPEAKER_12]: no um you know letting anyone know who was
going to be on it just sort of fell
[SPEAKER_12]: together um i always hope to be more
organized for the audience to let you know
[SPEAKER_12]: who's coming to kind of gear you up for it
but uh the loyal ones that have been
[SPEAKER_12]: watching since day one and that are always
here well you know it's really it's really
[SPEAKER_12]: for you guys and then for you guys to use
your relationships to talk about and and
[SPEAKER_12]: expose these conversations to a further
audience so i definitely want to thank
[SPEAKER_12]: everyone for that um i'm not sure how i'm
going to shut this down because it's all
[SPEAKER_12]: going live from my computer right now but
i think i can make myself an administrator
[SPEAKER_12]: here on my phone uh and if that's the case
um i should be able to shut down the
[SPEAKER_12]: recording and all that other stuff so you
are host now it does say that so you
[SPEAKER_12]: should be able to okay awesome well i want
to thank everyone if you guys all want to
[SPEAKER_12]: say goodbye i'm going to shut her down in
the next couple of minutes thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: marcus thank you everybody it was a great
meeting and conversation this day thank
[SPEAKER_14]: you thank you love it love it thank you
very much peter and mojave for joining us
[SPEAKER_14]: we hope to see more of you in the future
you're awesome and your knowledge is
[SPEAKER_14]: exponential i appreciate it sharing uh it
with you and i look forward to reading all
[SPEAKER_14]: about it peter i'm going to order some of
the soil because i want to try some of my
[SPEAKER_14]: hayseeds out in it yeah love you yeah
thanks everyone really great to be here
[SPEAKER_04]: look forward to coming back we need you
again for sure yes yes yes maybe we'll uh
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll pick up a guitar next time mark and
we can yeah definitely yes yes my uncle
[SPEAKER_04]: was the first road manager for the
grateful dead by the way jonathan reester
[SPEAKER_04]: get the fuck out of town damn wait a
second there's stories there we'll have to
[SPEAKER_04]: jump into that the man i call my uncle is
my dad's best friend partner in crime guy
[SPEAKER_03]: taught me how to drive but yeah next on
hash church yeah there you go see you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: peace everyone have a lovely day you you
you
