[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world I
am freshly back from Jamaica and instead
[SPEAKER_11]: of uploading all the Jamaican videos as I
would normally do after a trip What I've
[SPEAKER_11]: noticed is after I've uploaded four or
five or six of them you guys tend to get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bored and the views go
Substantially down and I want the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_11]: videos to get some nice views.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought I would intermix the videos
that I do in Between uploading the
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaican videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: So first off I wanted to start with saying
a Very happy birthday to my good buddy
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is his birthday today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We usually celebrate it in Amsterdam But
today, you know, we're in Canada So I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: hoping on seeing him later on for some
birthday puffs And for now what I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: planning on doing is I've loaded up my
sled.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually sweating like a maniac.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got my leafa On ready for the winter out
there and my old my old crew from up in
[SPEAKER_11]: Whistler Ryan and Dave Some great guys
have called me up and they've said we're
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna go sledding today It is early the
mountain only opened up yesterday But you
[SPEAKER_11]: know if the mountains good to ski on the
mountains good to sled on so that's what
[SPEAKER_11]: we're doing today It's gonna be a small
adventure.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just gonna go up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll record a little bit on the GoPro
Probably won't be too much fancy riding
[SPEAKER_11]: going on but definitely some epic views
and I want you guys to join me and puff
[SPEAKER_11]: with us each time we puff I'm bringing the
d-mail in the battery Sorry, the dabinator
[SPEAKER_11]: in the battery.
[SPEAKER_11]: My d-mail doesn't work off the battery.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm bringing my mighty volcano I'm
bringing my utmost pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm bringing a bunch of hash from a
variety of cool people like d420k and the
[SPEAKER_11]: West Coast concentrate crew myself Horatio
I've got a ton of great shit to hit up on
[SPEAKER_11]: the mountain with my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess with no further ado,
why don't we Hit a bowl Got some beautiful
[SPEAKER_11]: things that the West Coast concentrate
crew brought me just the day after I
[SPEAKER_11]: landed actually I'm not sure if you guys
can see that but You can see the quality
[SPEAKER_11]: on that there, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's some real fine full melt bubble
hash right there And I got to give it up
[SPEAKER_11]: to those West Coast concentrate crew,
you know I always think of them as a
[SPEAKER_11]: solventless company The company does make
a lot of BHO and other things but these
[SPEAKER_11]: particular guys Adam and Brett and Phil
they're really on the solventless quiver.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've got the dry sift they've got
the Ross and they've got the wet wash and
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, really they've been doing a
wonderful job at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my hats off to all of you guys Let's
see if we can't get a nice little waken
[SPEAKER_11]: baker in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The stuff is is just so perfect It just
self presses, you know, you give it a tiny
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of a finger and you get that So
very nice very nice Little dab a doodle.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure someone's gonna comment on how my
finger was dirty, but I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't worry about it We're doing this
Whistler thing today and we're gonna be in
[SPEAKER_11]: the Whistler backcountry So we won't be on
Whistler Mountain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, they don't really they frown a
little bit upon taking sleds onto the
[SPEAKER_11]: mountain, but We'll be across the street
actually either on Brandywine or Sprout.
[SPEAKER_11]: So who knows maybe we'll see some of you
guys out there and Let's have this hit and
[SPEAKER_11]: start making our way up to Whistler shall
we?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yummy All
[SPEAKER_11]: right Wakey wakey now that we've baked
let's get on with the show see you there
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we just went by furry Creek Which is
actually the golf course where Adam
[SPEAKER_11]: Sandler and Bob Barker got into the fight
in the movie Happy Gilmore Kind of wanted
[SPEAKER_11]: to film that for you guys hopefully on the
way back it'll still be light out and I'll
[SPEAKER_11]: be able to just film going by it and add
it into this little spot because That's a
[SPEAKER_11]: cool spot when you see the hole and
recognize it right by the ocean there a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of you might have thought it was a
lake So this is the last little spot right
[SPEAKER_11]: before Squamish so the Pacific Ocean which
you could probably barely see just ends up
[SPEAKER_11]: here and then there's the glacier in the
background up there and I guess soon we'll
[SPEAKER_11]: come around the corner and we'll see
Diamond Head as well and then we'll be
[SPEAKER_11]: into the Tantalus Mountain Range Tantalus
Mountain Range has been in countless
[SPEAKER_11]: snowboard and ski videos as well as sled
videos for that matter It's a pretty epic
[SPEAKER_11]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very European-esque very pointy
and sharp Not quite like the ones you see
[SPEAKER_11]: up around Whistler and Blackholm Which are
a lot more rounded out even though you can
[SPEAKER_11]: find some peeked out mountains up at
Brandywine that look almost French Alp-ish
[SPEAKER_11]: Right up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure you guys are gonna be able to
catch it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to give you a little shot of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is the mine that if any of you
watched the X-Files There was a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: scenes filmed there in there in particular
the one where Mulder sort of sees the gray
[SPEAKER_11]: aliens in the silhouette of the hallway
that was all filmed up in this little
[SPEAKER_11]: mining town Britannia it is called
Britannia Mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at dirt biking trails up on the
mountain up to the right here and Great
[SPEAKER_11]: salmon fishing over here on the left all
the salmon that spawn come up here and
[SPEAKER_11]: then of course you also have Coconese and
some rainbows that you can pull up out of
[SPEAKER_11]: the waters up here Alright coming through
this little little mountain range that
[SPEAKER_11]: they cut open and you kind of enter the
Squamish Valley and You end up with some
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty pretty beautiful vistas up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just past the ocean you end up with Mirren
Lake right here, so it's a pretty cool
[SPEAKER_11]: little lake Side of the mountain and
there's also some really beautiful trails
[SPEAKER_11]: just up to the right up here Alright,
so coming around we have the Big Chief on
[SPEAKER_11]: the right on the left.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have Diamond Head and Just up here is
Shannon Falls a really beautiful waterfall
[SPEAKER_11]: the first signs of winter a little bit of
frost and snow just on the side of the on
[SPEAKER_11]: the road there and We're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here we have Shannon Falls
Maybe a little view of the falls It's been
[SPEAKER_11]: a beautiful fall I've gone up to it with
D420k if you guys want to get a closer
[SPEAKER_11]: look at it That's about all we're gonna
get for now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, just rolling through Squamish.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just entered Squamish This is pretty
much the valley of Squamish Houses and you
[SPEAKER_11]: know a bunch of shops on the left here and
we're just gonna keep going straight on
[SPEAKER_11]: through Well, we have made it into the
bush Shit just got real So obviously we
[SPEAKER_11]: got to head up here quite a ways because
the parking lot is There's just too much
[SPEAKER_11]: gravel and shit ice.
[SPEAKER_11]: This would be brutal to try and drive up
on a sled so we're gonna head up this
[SPEAKER_11]: mountain as high as we can and then we're
gonna park and take our sled off and Go
[SPEAKER_11]: see if we can't go have a little fun
Alright guys, so we just got here to

hot Don't touch your finger around there
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go down?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's decide when we get there
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no track Just follow someone down
and just stay in the track right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're down the bottom you
can decide if you want to try it or not
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of us will go behind you and if
you can't do it you'll come up with one of
[SPEAKER_02]: us And one of us will take your side It's
not a problem We'll get her done It's not
[SPEAKER_04]: the same thing It does have a cross but
not like this It doesn't get the sun It
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get the late day sun because of
the bull there It's got late day sun now

something because it's definitely not as
[SPEAKER_11]: crusty Everyone is like, even me I'm like
destroyed Everything's serious man Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: serious business Everything is serious bro

if I could jump from the dabber and I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't Oh no, I have a wall on me Can I do
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah absolutely I don't think you'll have
any problem And if somebody struggles then
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple of them We got a big enough crew
Or we can just, if we do a couple of loops
[SPEAKER_04]: on the same run you'll have a nice easy
run in It's just my hand that's bugging me
