[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble man, set up the machine What kind
of strain you have there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is so clean and clear Come on!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here with Corey Cottenham at his
glass shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for having me, dude.
Anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some most beautiful glass that
you've been kind enough to share with us
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the newest style.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the recyclers I've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this one set up to the email
that we're about to hit for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll hit it while you're talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got some rainbow readies with
some pomegranate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice marble on the back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the 12 hole perk donut on the
inside with the return going down the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, dude, I never even saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy!
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they all have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have it except for the latest
one, which is the Klein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super sweet these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really tell, but he's got these
real bulbous bases and the water goes
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the bases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sturdy support too for emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a solid base, so you're not
tipping these guys over at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't feel tippy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one you have there is close to
a four and a half inch base for a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: inch height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice too, the way the ball is
stacked on top of the bottom piece and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tube going down the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really, like the lines are all
on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Congolese for the win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely got to wear the shades with
this bright light on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking pretty pasty right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that sound?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got someone to put some tunes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting the rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, I like the little pinky hold on the
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Corey earlier about we're
having an interesting conversation in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to innovation and what
glassblowers face in a world of having to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very careful that you don't bite
someone's style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because style is one thing, but then
there's certain welds or certain
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures that need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Techniques that can be shared and then you
can apply your own style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's difficult, I'm sure as a
glassblower, not wanting to bite on
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's style, yet seeing something that
you think, oh, I can really innovate
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use certain aspects and put them into your
own glass for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always our biggest struggle is to
find your own voice with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: glassblowers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty stoked on what I've been
doing recently with the new recyclers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cubic recyclers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different than what everybody's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just happy to kind of set myself
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find even when you're doing things that
other people are doing, you still stand
[SPEAKER_00]: well apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be really perfectly honest that
one of the first times I saw, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had this intense Ratticello pattern on
one of those older tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the only time I had seen work that
was that quality was like Dosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Dosa tube and people were like,
this is a $15,000 tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Corey's got a bunch of those on
his desk right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they look perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, as you moved into this,
I personally have not seen a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the different shapes of the cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to get into your
cubic ones in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just sort of going, starting with
these ones first, but just the whole vibe
[SPEAKER_00]: of the piece is so well put together and
so it's just got like a happy feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a photographer, when I look at the
piece as well, it has almost a frightening
[SPEAKER_00]: level of precision in how you've stacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I look at these things very
closely when it comes to photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my biggest pet peeve is having
anything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bug me for weeks and weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put the time in to get
everything lined up and straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just amazing that you have the
ability that you can even do that because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that just anyone could do
such a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I understand how working glass
happens and I understand what you guys do
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a fairly capable person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at a lot of people's benches and
they have really busy backgrounds with
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers and posters and everything
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of need like a clear spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in front of my bench,
I just have just the tin so it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no distractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm lining stuff up, I've got
nothing kind of distracting my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the pieces in frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes incredible sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you could even take it to the
next level where you could have behind you
[SPEAKER_00]: angles on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine having perfect... Some people will
set up mirrors and stuff so they can see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's part of being an artist
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the artistic endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the vision that allows you to get
things so perfectly symmetrical that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's a synergy that's created
when you create a piece that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly symmetrical and none of the
lines are off that you get more than what
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pieces add up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that in most of the glass pieces
that you've ever shown me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're hiding the broken
and the shitty ones, but like everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever shown me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn to hide different defects here
and there as you roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the glass always will throw curve
balls at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's how you learn to roll with it and
adapt to situations that come up as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel that when you do a
collaboration that it's also very
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic and it's always like,
you know, when I saw this piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it, I was like, holy smokes,
like, how did he do that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like, oh, this is a
collaboration with Steve Sizelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve's sections are always on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always awesome working with his work for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once again, being able to have
someone to take your work and to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: together in a way that is so perfectly
symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the piece is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different welds and so many little
different additional pieces that can go
[SPEAKER_00]: just the slightest bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe less than a centimeter,
especially things like the can,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the can, things like the,
the downstem and the, and the female,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where she plugs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more Sizelo sections come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some torsos coming by him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look out for some more collabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you guys can get to a level
where all of a sudden now it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: mailing pieces to each other, that is,
you know, makes it that much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just opens up a whole new world of
possibilities of who you can work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first learned about glass blowing
and collaborations, I pictured a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration being two blowers,
blowing next to one another and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: to be next to one another and they had to
show each other the pieces on the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just not the case
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downfall I find is that you don't
get to hold the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Steve might not have a chance to
actually physically see this piece in
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some pieces that I've,
I've had a part of and I'll never get to
[SPEAKER_00]: see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a little heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, you have these surprises
out there that are potentially waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows down the road it might come,
come, come into that's definitely got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the bonuses of the glassblower
where you have people that are excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've collected a piece from your past
and they're also excited when meeting you
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Max Poland who just posted
a piece the other day that someone popped
[SPEAKER_00]: by from his past.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, yeah, that's always the best
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just loving all the colors on these
really, really lovely different color
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you go about, is it really straight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just going to do a purple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll pace for a couple hours
even before I start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's like I'll grab colors and
X-Nay the colors and keep going back to my
[SPEAKER_00]: palette and not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sometimes that's a big struggle
is just getting started and having a game
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using colors in the sense of
pulling them out and using them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you taking colored glass out and
laying it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, if you could take a shot of my
supply downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have all my color tube laid down so
I can see it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, I kind of just look for the
right combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're definitely nailing it on
combinations, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to have as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's somebody who wants to say
hi here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my boy, Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to say hi?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about daddy's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about his artistic vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's incredible, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I mean, it's easy for me to just
look at it and go, yeah, I like these
[SPEAKER_00]: color sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not quite sure that I would be
able to go over to the glass and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I need this red and this particular
kind of yellowish and green sort of color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, I want to kind of make new
combinations all the time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy to just keep going for that
same color pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, I don't know, it's hard to
come up with the new ideas all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new, I'm having a tie right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up way too early this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain's asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, for me, I do these
little videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, I might edit something that
says thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always just turn thanks red and for
gold and watching green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, gold and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a color pattern I know that works.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always want to change it up and I'm
like, man, like I don't have the vision to
[SPEAKER_00]: continually pull, and that's a simple,
you know, just words on a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so much more committed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're deeply committed when you- Yeah,
if you use the colors and then you get two
[SPEAKER_00]: days into a piece and then you're like,
wait a minute, I don't even like these
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like crap to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, I don't know, some people-
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you'll find some people love
those pieces the best.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work that you hate yourself,
people will just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have it as a photographer all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only share what I think is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the odd time I've done the experiment
of sharing something I really didn't like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets the reception of people in,
oh, certain people really enjoy that or
[SPEAKER_00]: like that the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appeals to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of shows you the difference in all
of the people out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many of us that as long as you
make it nice, there's always going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that loves that particular
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Style or- Style, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't mind getting a little bit of
footage of you on the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on another recycler that I'm
just changing the shapes a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll see how that works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, let's go check that out and
then we'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll clear these out and then we'll do
the cubic recyclers.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the newest recycler I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of switching up the shape a
little bit and just kind of experimenting
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be amazed if you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm just gonna get two holes ready
to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: To meet up with the holes that I have up
for the return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the return, up for the purge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up with all the turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready to make two arms that
are coming up from this hole that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: about to open up to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same on the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my cubic recyclers, I usually keep it
under the Monson for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find I have a lot more cracking issues
with these shapes than with just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: bone objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you digging the multiple flames?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this just heats everything up and
keeps it all happy a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same thing and kind of like
go into a bushier flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just kind of gotten used to working
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys just feel safer for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make it to the end of my pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just blow it out without popping a hole
and I'll do the same to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to line them up as close as I can to
the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks symmetrical in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need to do any adjusting from one
hole, if they're not exactly even,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just speed up and kind of blow one
side out to match the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blew those little bubbles right out,
hey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it really easy when I'm going to
tear it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep that whole spot open.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I blow one side out, then I blew a
really thin and it'll go to a really flat
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll leave me with a perfect opening
if I pop it and peel it at the right time,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when I go to ream it open,
it just saves me a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot cleaner looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it opened up pretty nice
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice round opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have to mess with it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might just peel off this one little spot
that's got a little bit of a thicker
[SPEAKER_00]: section just where I peeled it off.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to mess with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with that hole open, I'll go and
rip a hole open on the top and get that
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I have both those holes
open, I'll grab my tube that I have and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll just bend it into the shape that
I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get two bends at the same time so I
can match the bends and then I'll connect
[SPEAKER_00]: one while I have the two openings,
work those in and then I'll go repeat the
[SPEAKER_00]: process on the other side and then do the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one I can't blow like I did the
other one so I just have to peel it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now with that one hole already
open, I just get it to where it's flat
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like watching magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this goes back into the kiln until
I shape the arm and attach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for sharing that with us,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite as bright now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, uh, Corey did a little bit of
glass blowing, showed us his bench and now
[SPEAKER_00]: we are back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the cubic recyclers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cubic orbs and the cubic cyclers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three are the cubic orbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these are the more, the simplified
version, a little less work than some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these guys retail at two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that ever nice though?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water in that bottom chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of not really a big fan of the
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it's just to give a distance
from the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the internal drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give enough distance from where the
purge to the drain is and to avoid it
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting up the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, uh, I've switched up this
design on these, uh, these guys here to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, add the client aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just like, gives it a further
distance to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you do that with an orb one or did
you just change the shape of this up top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first one that I did the client
switch to see the difference was this one
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this was the first one that I,
uh, tried the client return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really chuggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a deeper, deeper hall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mentioned it on numerous occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the square shaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the circular shaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just different shapes other than
the standard can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As do I know as for the reason for the
exploration of the different shapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to program them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All together gather and make them look
really nice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like from the bottom up,
you know, minus this base that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: that standard can in there, but then to
just throw this on top of it is really
[SPEAKER_01]: super stylish and elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the concave so you can sink the
ball down a lot lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not sitting up like these guys for
the cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball sits that much higher on the
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that the ball just kind of
tucks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it like that a little more sleek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually like the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting in the cup almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one as well, which is the one that
we've been hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you were saying the retail on these
ones were around, uh, that one would be
[SPEAKER_01]: 35, 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a deep chug too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a little bit of a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad we got to check out the new recyclers
as well as these cubic and orb recyclers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep up with the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never want to make mistakes on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to respect the names that the
glass blowers have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to say, it seems like it's been
more than a few years since I've dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: off and able to know what all of these
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many of them out there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different blowers, so many
different styles, so many different things
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, it's a real pleasure always
to come over and check out your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a bunch of photos at the
end of this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stick around guys and you'll be able to
see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, much thanks Corey for sending me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep watching Bellaman's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to you guys soon.
