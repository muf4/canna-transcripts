[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, we just got to the show,
the puffin' top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone just brought by some Congolese
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that's some sweet shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that rip, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduce yourself, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is John's Medi Kush, grown by John.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually could smell this through the
fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goosebumps when I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show us those goosebumps again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, are those ever clear, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got goosebumps when he smelled your
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to tell Venti that we're
going to crush this over screens tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to grind up every little bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And harvest just those glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to pop it with you on
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt dry sips.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll still smoke those legs after that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medi One, Medi Kush, Medtainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: My medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the right we have a T-Funk Hoob's
Collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left we have a Saki Bomb Hoob's
Collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these are one-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Saki Bomb is the only one with a
three-volt perk in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The T-Funk has a three-volt disc perk as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not as big as the Saki Bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the custom mouthpiece that eliminates
splash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no splash on this little guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's key right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a small piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in a splash guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Omni Nail just looks ever so sweet
on the T-Funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going to be looking at
here, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Dosa JRead Robin Hood
Collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the smallest piece Dosa has ever
made in terms of a mini tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's five inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has a fully functional tie bucket signed
by Dosa JRead and Robin Hood 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line work is just exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to work something this small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be done with a hand torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's that Dosa Crust Opal,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Opal encasement on it is just
unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stringers to actually make those sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring that Opal marble back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get in on that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have two different colored Opals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Fire Opal on the bottom and
then the Icy Opal on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a full tie bucket as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushed Opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little dose of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that looks great in the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speechless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I only have one thing to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to hit this sick little piece
that MJ from Morrow has brought with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's playing with some barb 99% dry silt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no torches allowed in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a little bit careful with how we torch
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing the back torching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stand nearby as well, so nobody's the
wiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight low-key torching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight low-key torching at the champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to hit itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked to hit this piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Annual pendant barb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
That is a nice piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit that barb going in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ought to hit it at least twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should taste so good.
So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It heats up faster that second time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bar grip.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can save four heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm loving these small pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smaller, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be all about the big,
huge, giant, airy hit, and now it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: the smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small, concentrated, tiny little hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the true flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time, we're going to hit the 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: It presses so fast in the hands of the
barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just boom, pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damning it up at champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my good friend, Sarah
Sunday, that we have only really hung out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do video chats all the time,
and I get to see her weave, but I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really tell how awesome it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of believe her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me some of her wares.
Yeah, this is quite a weird looking stuff,
but I didn't know it was right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six, seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of show you a little nug there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the camera will...
[SPEAKER_00]: This is overdone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably taken 10 days over that,
because we pressed it a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so this is not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Lilac Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lilac Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic nebula cured for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that we can get it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the camera, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two month cure on the organic nebula.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh and then the whole box is just full.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that for a vault?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cash crop, Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's this one called again?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Jazz Buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz Buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, Jazz Buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to do a dab or two,
me and Sarah here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super stoked that she was able to show me
her nugget.
Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this one so far is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right away honestly reminded me
of being at SOMA's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she calls this one AFI.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it definitely has some very strong
hazy undertones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medman seeds with the west or east?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing to do with East Coast sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast sour diesel, not to be confused
with East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing to do with East.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also calls it kerosene push now,
but now it's been sort of somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: branded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a pickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grow out a variety of different
seed company stuff.
You're not loyal to any one.
You look for the best you can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to send her your interesting
clones if you want to see some stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: produced on an exceptional level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting in touch with Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How come you're getting in touch with me
out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some nice weed here, Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say goodbye to Sarah now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue to look at her
awesome nug.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
Oh, thank you.
Oh excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: In, not in the hole, but in the little
moat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheech glass girl dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste on that will last for minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a friend show up a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a bubble bag user, a fan,
and he just brought some Tahoe OG by for
[SPEAKER_02]: us to check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check this little nugget out right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get that clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, because everyone
knows I don't pop side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought the Tahoe OG bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very careful the way out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super crazy Cali-O like tangy flavor on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste as good as it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Champs 2014 Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is that OG Tahoe OG
with the 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 120, 160.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 420 at the bubble medtainer booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's fucking do this, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not in, you're not in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, he's in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not smoking, we're vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That big cloudy smoke is really just
vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll dissipate in minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420 at the Champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey wait, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 rip, Mr. Cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Philip Freshie, that's the ass end of
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I don't want to have that then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a nice machine coming from
Champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you grow this and make it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Cookie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they said it was Keith, but it was
actually bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo, dry sift, bubble, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some paper thin goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's lemony goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and our 420 session is now a
421 session.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we got medtainer John showing
Ross Rebliati some of his gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one we got, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whole plant extracted off of the plant
using bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole plant went right into the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, John and I do our education
together all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We show people how to extract just the
pure gold amber trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that's part of why this is
pure and nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full melt, dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drop on there and there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to touch the bowl at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take the hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding your endocannabinoid system can
involve taking vaporizer hits through
[SPEAKER_02]: denials or eating medibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't worry about leaving smoke in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes a little bit will be left over,
but it's just vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how it's not causing me any
problems right now, right after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: John has neck and back injuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't cough like a maniac after every
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it needs to be pure, clean,
and proper.
[SPEAKER_08]: No plant matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: No plant matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me catch my breath for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take one in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Loud talkers back on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubble Man, doing it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was your name?
[SPEAKER_10]: Akil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Akil's in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Bubble Man holding it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy's brought down the Congolese Full
Melt Bubble Hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do some rips.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking price.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks that you saved that for how long,
a year?
[SPEAKER_11]: Six months.
[SPEAKER_11]: Six months.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still damn impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congolese Full Melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, Jason?
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the grades going.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grading up, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Taking in the rigs, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Supreme dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's so nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab a dab a dude, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard that one yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you got the dab shit on, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wrap that on cam, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have access to streams that
everyone's heard of and wants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe doesn't have it in their guard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't get their hands on that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to help you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of their reach, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Bubble Man, you got to bring it
international together, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Share.
[SPEAKER_08]: Share your genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Akil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right in the door to a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way from Holland to dab in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab away the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, OK, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do the most for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: David, hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never stops here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally worked for seven hours today
at the boot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, with all our good friends,
here in the room, dabbing it up with
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Simon will do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael hit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dab away the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw my good friend, and he said to me,
one dab would keep the doctor away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about your dabbing too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Relax and free the mood.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to jump up and walk out of here
with everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else for a dabadoo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make way for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the power of cannabinoid education.
[SPEAKER_07]: And pass it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership in full effect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we done?
[SPEAKER_12]: Simon wants a rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: Feed him a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Barb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, look at that greasy fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was powder this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have some powder tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some powder right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull out the powder out of there,
the Barb powder.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from this to this, I had it in my
pocket all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it did that pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't take hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the longer it goes, the greasier it
gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see this one greasing right in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost that ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Copacabana, we're going to hook up with
Remo and crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say, Remo?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's head on up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking crazy place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome place.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all, like, crazy hot chicks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.
Yeah.
That's pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we are at the Copacabana having
a nice meal with a bunch of kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having a nice meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're already puffing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and the mannequin have been alone,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm videotaping, this is something
you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got the bill, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see this in a restaurant.
Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome back to the end of the
night, guys, sitting here with Horatio and
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a nice, crazy restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Copacabana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Copacabana.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the top model something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Canada universe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Canada universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was also random things like
weird salsa dancers, Brazilian salsa
[SPEAKER_02]: dancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dudes coming up, cutting beef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that was nonstop.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the beef that they served,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a vegetarian, so I didn't eat any.
[SPEAKER_02]: But John can tell you about that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know, one is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I really thought I was surrounded
by like 50 supermodels, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pretty good night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually really nice to see all the
different races and all of the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing about it was actually
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Remo and Sandra invited us all down
for that dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was quite a bit of industry people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon from Serious Seeds was there,
and Matt and Sarah from the House of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Great Gardener, and the Mailman brothers
were there, and LaFumo Canada was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Tim, his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny Cavanchi was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice group of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's interesting as in saying
that we walk into this restaurant and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's people dancing, and it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, for a night blazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figured we'd finish it off on day
three of The Champs, which is really only
[SPEAKER_02]: day two of The Champs, but day three of
mine and John's adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we figured we'd end this night with
a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was mine, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm right in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to load you up,
or you got something?
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some 90 My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see that real like uplifting high
right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect thing right before bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: John, go to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So last night we were up till two because
we were puffing on My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember in Amsterdam puffing on Scott's
moonshine haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit kept me up till four or five in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to town, so it's still BC time
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat style.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 8.48 in BC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today was a really great day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some good education going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of different people that came into
town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to actually the next event
that we're going to be hosting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see where it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow's really the start of The Champs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today was just business to business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tomorrow will really be the first kind
of day of feeling how much public will
[SPEAKER_02]: show up and how much interest there's
