[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here in Kingston, Jamaica at the
Pegasus Hotel right across the street from
[SPEAKER_10]: Emancipation Park.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm here with CRD, Cannabinoid
Research and Development for the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientific review, which is SRC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here out of Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're the scientific review
committee and they're throwing a
[SPEAKER_10]: conference with a wide broad of subjects
in regards to cannabis and how it would
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially impact the island through
medical tourism and through farming and
[SPEAKER_10]: through basically the whole economics of
the island.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys know a little bit about my
involvement with CRD, so I'm here with my
[SPEAKER_10]: partners as well as Tony from United
Cannabis as our bilateral partners.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, we're excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony's going to be on a panel,
so I'm going to make sure I film that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's some other great speakers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. William Courtney is in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those of you that don't remember
Dr. William Courtney, he was the one,
[SPEAKER_10]: the doctor from some time ago now,
several years ago that had the young
[SPEAKER_10]: patient that was about eight months old
who had the large tumor in her head
[SPEAKER_10]: splitting the hemispheres of her brain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they used cannabis oil and juicing to
literally shrink the tumor out of
[SPEAKER_10]: existence and save her life from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's going to be here speaking and a
whole wide variety of other people are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be speaking.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Archibald Bishop is going to be
opening it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Henry Lowe is also speaking,
I believe, and Dr. Watson from SRC.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll make sure I catch all this on
video and right now we're actually going
[SPEAKER_10]: to head down and check out our booth,
the United Cannabis and CRD booth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't you come check it out with
us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gibber.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have that toque in my suitcase.
[SPEAKER_10]: He forgot it in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you want to hear where the story is?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can't give you any bad effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just flower smells.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of oranges in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of oranges here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that vitamin C is carrying a modulator,
which is called a terpene.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that terpene that's present in fruit
helps as a catalyst for the push of that
[SPEAKER_11]: vitamin C into your body.
[SPEAKER_11]: So cannabis has all of the world's fruits
and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells like broccoli, cauliflower,
citrus, wood, sandal, fuel.
[SPEAKER_11]: All those things are found in cannabis
because cannabis is older than most of the
[SPEAKER_11]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you look back 30 million years,
it's survived catastrophic events.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's migrated all around the world in
different elevations, in different
[SPEAKER_11]: temperatures, and it created 808 different
land races.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the only four plants on earth
that can self-generate.
[SPEAKER_11]: It pollinates the air as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that means if it went into survival
mode, it could actually produce its own
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: As he said, self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So even the ocean went down to 96%
catastrophic events before, when we've had
[SPEAKER_11]: meters and different things that are
planted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis, hemp, has survived that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am now in the main conference hall where
the speakers will be speaking.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the table set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got some great banners,
green gold.
[SPEAKER_10]: The conference, medical ganja,
and other natural products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have the SRC, scientific
research council.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is their third biannual conference on
science and technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, this is where the speakers will
be happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today we've got Mr. Courtney Campbell,
Professor Archibald MacDonald.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Honorable Philip Harwine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Mason McCarllidge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Mr. Hawthorne Watson, who owns
Cannisol and was, I believe, the original
[SPEAKER_10]: proprietor and creator of Cannisol.
[SPEAKER_10]: A patient using cannabinoids for glaucoma
for the release of ocular pressure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all in all, it looks like it's going to
be a pretty good event.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make sure I try to capture as much of
the speakers as possible and walk you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: through it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe do a couple of interviews with some
different people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Benefits to our island.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, we're here and I'm inviting you to
sit back as we discuss on the theme for
[SPEAKER_13]: the SRC's third biannual exposition,
conference, and talks.
[SPEAKER_13]: This year's theme being Greece.
[SPEAKER_13]: Green gold, medicinal ganja, and other
natural products.
[SPEAKER_13]: A potential source of wealth.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, for too long, the word ganja has not
been mentioned publicly without the
[SPEAKER_13]: connotations to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we're dispelling those myths.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're taking a leap forward in this
millennium and we're taking it to where it
[SPEAKER_13]: needs to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: The scientific research council has
undertaken this task and we've invited
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone here, in particular, members of
government, visitors from overseas,
[SPEAKER_13]: inventors and innovators, to share and to
offer their knowledge on this intriguing
[SPEAKER_13]: topic.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, without further ado, let's begin.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we open with the national anthem as we
all stand for the playing of the national
[SPEAKER_13]: anthem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bow our heads as we invite the
presence of the Lord on the proceeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gathering of great minds once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord, we thank you that you have given us
the earth and all that there is and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need, Lord, is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Lord, we thank you as we seek during
this few days to study some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful gift you have given us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help that out of this conference will come
some great decisions that will take this
[SPEAKER_01]: country forward economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord, we are seeking, we are searching for
your guidance and help our policymakers as
[SPEAKER_01]: they ponder what to do, Lord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guide them that the right decisions will
be made, that your people will prosper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Lord, just bless this evening,
bless all that will be said and done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we give you thanks for Christ's sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms. Dietrich.
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, ladies and gentlemen,
once again I'd like to welcome members of
[SPEAKER_13]: the media and welcome our visiting minds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we move straight into what will be
certainly an intriguing delivery of
[SPEAKER_13]: greetings from the Honorable Philip
Polwell, Minister of Science, Technology,
[SPEAKER_13]: Energy and Mining.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_09]: I greet you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I greet our distinguished presenter this
evening in the form of the Principal of
[SPEAKER_09]: the University Campus, Professor McDonald,
Chairman of the SRC Board, other members
[SPEAKER_09]: of the Board present, members of the NCSD,
members of the private and public sectors,
[SPEAKER_09]: ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought about the hand clap just now and
I thought that would be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_09]: popular than that, especially because,
and I know the foreigners who are with us
[SPEAKER_09]: won't appreciate this, but I do give them
a sense to the use of the term green.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Green.
All right, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that, you know, I could have put
orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I am full of life in relation to the
topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure you will all forgive me
because I just stepped out of cabinet and
[SPEAKER_09]: will return in a moment to continue the
business of the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, this is such a tremendous
program that we are embarked on,
[SPEAKER_09]: not for the first time, but certainly as
we celebrate Science and Technology
[SPEAKER_09]: Innovation Month.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it is very significant that
the government, the SRC, is sponsoring
[SPEAKER_09]: this discussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is true that the word ganja used to be
one that the government would stay very
[SPEAKER_09]: far from.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the time has come.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, many of you will agree with me
that the time has come long ago and we are
[SPEAKER_09]: really catching up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the energy inside is very,
very low right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there are some persons outside
who are a little higher than we are
[SPEAKER_09]: inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not too sure if it's the
exuberance outside that is not filtering.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a word I'm using,
filtering.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not catching on to it at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is truly historic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the month has started with our Prime
Minister reconstituting the National
[SPEAKER_09]: Commission of Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is very significant
because for a number of years,
[SPEAKER_09]: the commission was in the door,
John wasn't meeting, and we have now
[SPEAKER_09]: enabled a fine grouping of stakeholders
representing government, academia,
[SPEAKER_09]: the private sector, coming together to
recognize that without science and
[SPEAKER_09]: technology and the big I, what is the big
I?
[SPEAKER_09]: Innovation, then all the talk about
growth, about come 2017 to be able to walk
[SPEAKER_09]: away from the IMF because we are growing
and because jobs are being created.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then all of that will come to naught.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that we now need to become totally
preoccupied with growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm so pleased that in her first
statement to the council, she presented on
[SPEAKER_09]: nutraceuticals or cultural industries and
the Jamaican brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jamaican brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of us are still unclear, but we
accept as gospel because it has been
[SPEAKER_09]: proven.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something in our flavors.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something about our herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you prefer herbs, herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something about where we are
located perhaps, something in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So regardless of the last opportunities
we've had with ganja, Jamaica has a famous
[SPEAKER_09]: brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that brand will outstrip forgive me
the foreigners who are here, but it will
[SPEAKER_09]: outstrip Colorado, can't come near urban,
and all those other states that are now
[SPEAKER_09]: through their internal democracy,
recognizing the value of this crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will not be left behind anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very glad that I'm the Minister of
Science, Technology and Innovation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think the time has come and you
know, I take risks.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the way we're gonna get this
country to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You win some, you lose some, but you have
to do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no way we're going to be able to
move quicker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly as a country to secure this growth
that we're aiming at.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't go out and play some strokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of you who are foreigners,
you don't understand cricket.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we love to hit sixes when we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it represents scoring.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can be in the wicket and be safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you go out there to play the runs,
you're likely to lose your wicket,
[SPEAKER_09]: but sometimes luck, prayers, but the
courage to go forward and to take the
[SPEAKER_09]: risk.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this I think is a risk.
[SPEAKER_09]: The staging of this discussion,
but more importantly, moving rapidly now.
[SPEAKER_09]: To ensure that the regulatory framework is
in place and that we no longer need to be
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let not perfection be the enemy of the
good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us start something and we can build on
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And already we're seeing many models that
we can look at.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is gonna be an inherent Jamaican
model that we could export to the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the model.
[SPEAKER_09]: On Wednesday we are going to be
celebrating
[SPEAKER_09]: those members of our scientific community
who have excelled.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing wrong with having an
awards function for the artists and the
[SPEAKER_09]: sports people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They deserve it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But why should we not be celebrating
similarly the achievements of our
[SPEAKER_09]: scientists, our technology?
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people ask me, so why you spend
this money to celebrate?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you dressing up in black tie to
come and to proclaim the success of our
[SPEAKER_09]: people?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no apology for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be those people and
those of us who understand that until we
[SPEAKER_09]: start to add value to what we produce at a
basic level, until we become totally
[SPEAKER_09]: consumed about outperforming the people in
Colorado in this area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until we recognize that it's a global
village and we can't exist in the comfort
[SPEAKER_09]: of a local market.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to understand that everything is
everything and that we now have to compete
[SPEAKER_09]: with the world and Jamaicans can when we
are ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so pleased to see Dr. Henry Low here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, first time we would hesitate to
call him here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Professor McDonald chairs a committee and
he has already forgiven me for not
[SPEAKER_09]: remaining during this presentation because
I could easily have written the speech.
[SPEAKER_09]: But mind us a part where he criticizes
government.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm the patron of that group and we
saw this coming and I am so happy to have
[SPEAKER_09]: fully embraced the work and the continued
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me say to everybody here, there is
space for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can't start this drive with people
feeling that some will be left out and
[SPEAKER_09]: some will be able to go through the green
gates.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for those who are involved
in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for those who are involved
in processing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for those who are involved
in marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for those who will continue
to do research and development so that
[SPEAKER_09]: every day we add value to what we're doing
with ganja.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is space for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as government, we want to signal that
from very early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for your
attentiveness.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came with a speech, but you don't really
want a speech.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the energy that I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can imagine if I gave the speech,
then we're all asleep before I finish.
[SPEAKER_09]: But good to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see some of you on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Further in a month, we'll see you at
Emancipation Park.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take S&TI to the people of
Jamaica, to our children, to the youth man
[SPEAKER_09]: on the corner, because there's a space in
this portfolio, science, technology,
[SPEAKER_09]: innovation, for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to leave out none.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for being here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Honorable Minister.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm feeling high after that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, too, am colorblind.
[SPEAKER_13]: Green, gold.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does incorporate and encompass the
colors on our flag.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's an appropriate title.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it works.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I want to welcome our visitors from
overseas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry if the minister is bashing
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: We love you still.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want your stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have ours.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we love you still.
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, I'm going to invite a lovely
lady, a very lovely lady.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she speaks very quietly when she's
passing you in the chair.
[SPEAKER_13]: But she has a very powerful delivery.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she has a very powerful message.
[SPEAKER_13]: So without further ado, let me invite Miss
Melissa McCarge, the chairman of the SRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as charismatic as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you all for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All protocols observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to, first of all,
recognize our esteemed guest speaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Archibald MacDonald,
who will be presenting to us tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to, first of all,
welcome all of you that are in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart is warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not expect to see this large crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see we have standing only as we are
here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I welcome you all to this very good
evening of highness.
[SPEAKER_00]: As chair of the SRC, I really am humbled
to be asked to bring greetings to the
[SPEAKER_00]: group tonight on behalf of our
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard work and planning that was
undertaken to ensure that the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: days we bring insight is rewarded tonight
by your attendance to our opening
[SPEAKER_00]: ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by extension, the attendances is
confirmed for the next two days to this or
[SPEAKER_00]: third biannual conference on S&T,
which has been themed, as everybody says,
[SPEAKER_00]: green gold, medicinal ganja, and other
natural products, a potential source of
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not only here focusing on the
hemp or the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at all herbs in general and
what we can achieve from those potential
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only reiterate that the successful
convocation of the conference is a source
[SPEAKER_00]: of joy for the SRC and stands as a
testament and a commitment to the agency's
[SPEAKER_00]: mandate to popularize science and
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have set out during S&T month,
for which November has been proclaimed,
[SPEAKER_00]: with tremendous enthusiasm on the march
towards the modernization of our S&T
[SPEAKER_00]: forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this conference theme,
splendid prospects lie before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must, on a national level, avidly
pursue agricultural development as a
[SPEAKER_00]: multidisciplinary concept that encompasses
the economic, social, institutional,
[SPEAKER_00]: and physical elements of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This exciting forum is entirely dedicated
to recent developments in medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and related natural products,
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing to think of all the work
that have been done and that also all the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that's left ahead of us in terms of
mining our green gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Institutions can participate, companies,
and of course, individual entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thrust that has been put in over
the last few years stands as a testimony
[SPEAKER_00]: that these groups are prepared for the
long haul for success for our country and
[SPEAKER_00]: also for their own business enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to seed development for
this country and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conference committee has put together
a truly unique program that addresses the
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations being undertaken in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when you look at the program,
you're looking at multiple areas in
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal marijuana, which will be
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uses of raw cannabis, the cosmaceutical
industry, and by extension, how to create
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth from all this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover a number of areas and
questions are encouraged during the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the few days, the lineup of clean air
presentations will be delivered by locally
[SPEAKER_00]: and internationally renowned experts in
their areas of specialities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is anticipated that this conference
will be a platform for sharing and
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing not only their ideas,
but your own research with these key
[SPEAKER_00]: persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these topics are at the top of the
innovation list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot stress that innovation must
be seen as one of the main solutions for
[SPEAKER_00]: overcoming poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my earnest request that you make use
of this time to explore ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen with an ear tuned to see how you
too can partake in this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: create those networking linkages that lead
to the creative development of ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the phase of just discussion,
but instead translating those into working
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypes to take to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, as I offer you
greetings, I would like to thank our main
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of sponsors,
but this particular sponsor, Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: Royals, without them we could not have had
this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, a special mention must be
made of all the organizing and scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: committee members for their contribution
to the organizing of this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the next few days will be filled
with information and in fact, prove
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiring and transformative to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you will impart your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, I thank you and wish you
a very good evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much, Ms. McCarge.
[SPEAKER_13]: And coming on the heels of that,
we say we bid adieu to our minister.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember you're on the orange side when
you go back to parliament.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, at this time, we're going to
get the overview of the conference and
[SPEAKER_13]: exposition for this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, just so that we don't confuse it and
for those of you who may not know,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's said to be the third biennial,
but what it actually means is that since
[SPEAKER_13]: 2008, it has become a biennial event,
but the conference has actually been going
[SPEAKER_13]: on since 1987.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we say third, it don't mean that
it's in its infancy and it's just
[SPEAKER_13]: starting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It means that they just changed the
rotation a little bit so that they do it
[SPEAKER_13]: every two years so they have more money to
spend on give us food when we come,
[SPEAKER_13]: like, you know, sit down at the Pegasus
house and eat.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it has been going on for quite some
time and it shows its strength in the fact
[SPEAKER_13]: that it continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking forward to more things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just so that we understand what's
happening for this conference,
[SPEAKER_13]: the overview will be delivered by Mr.
Hawthorne Watson, the acting executive
[SPEAKER_13]: director of the SRC.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the interest of time, may I say all
protocols.
[SPEAKER_08]: Firstly, I think I would want to put the
theme of the conference in some sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: context.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that regard, I'm very proud to note
that this little rock of ours called
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamaica runs fifth in plant biodiversity
among island states through the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Jamaica deserves a round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in furtherance of that, you'll find
that 83 of some 160 plants identified with
[SPEAKER_08]: medicinal properties are actually found in
this island.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Jamaica needs to be big up again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of these we know about, you know,
folklore and our bush medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we scientists like to look upon the
plants and the extracts as natural
[SPEAKER_08]: products because they grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_08]: They grow in nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a lecturer and examiner, I am known to
be very miserly with marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there's a certain special
Jamaican natural products, a product
[SPEAKER_08]: rather, that I would not hesitate to give
a high grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially when you consider the
groundswell of interest by several nations
[SPEAKER_08]: in Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: The varieties which are not nearly as good
and take into account Sanjay Gupta's
[SPEAKER_08]: experience on his own road to Damascus,
where he was converted to radical
[SPEAKER_08]: ganjaism.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence the theme, green, gold, medicinal
ganja and other natural products,
[SPEAKER_08]: a potential source of wealth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't add for Jamaica, but we really
mean for Jamaica and in fact the wider
[SPEAKER_08]: Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are tonight to kickstart the
engagement and to have the keynote address
[SPEAKER_08]: delivered not by Professor Archibald as
Pro-White Chancellor and Principal of UWI,
[SPEAKER_08]: but as its Chairman and as the Minister
alluded, of the Cannabis Commercial,
[SPEAKER_08]: Medicinal and Research Task Force.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to prepare us for when the tire hits
the road tomorrow, day one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Day one will focus on research,
policy and legislation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It begins with a plea.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be followed by three
sessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Session one, look at the medicinal
research on medicinal ganja.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Jamaica and the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are looking at the Caribbean
because while we are slow-pacing,
[SPEAKER_08]: others are catching up and passing us by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Needless to say that THC was characterized
in 1963, but Jamaicans were in ganja from
[SPEAKER_08]: 1969 turning out new compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have the bubble slip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Session two, we'll look at other natural
products because remember that ganja is a
[SPEAKER_08]: natural product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And session three will cover policy and
legislation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be important in light
of government's announcement to
[SPEAKER_08]: decriminalize the ganja.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the papers is going to be on
medicinal ganja, industrial and what they
[SPEAKER_08]: are, they're not quite the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll end the day with a robust panel
discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: To be moderated by the effervescent Devon
Morrison, member of the board of SRC.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have six panelists coming
from various perspective, from the
[SPEAKER_08]: religious, to the farming, to the
technical, all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it presents an opportunity for you to
ask questions and make comments and be
[SPEAKER_08]: interactive.
[SPEAKER_08]: The morning and the evening was the first
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we come to day two and I'll just
summarize in the interest of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Day two focuses exclusively on the
business side of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: How we can build industrial relationship,
market trends, intellectual property
[SPEAKER_08]: rights, which is very key.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are registering the Jamaica brand
all over the place and missing back.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to step up to the plate.
[SPEAKER_08]: What equipment we need and don't let us
fool ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these pieces of equipment are very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: One could cost you 400,000 U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's big money business, but you can make
big money from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Essential oils, Jamaican, and plants are
known for their flavors, their aroma,
[SPEAKER_08]: and for their colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And essential oil is big business in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are several other presentations and
I note that we'll be having five
[SPEAKER_08]: contestants vying for the SRC Young
Scientist Award and a place in history.
[SPEAKER_08]: They too will make their presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: In summary, conference 2014 will have 24
presentations comprising a keynote address
[SPEAKER_08]: which will have a plenary, two overviews,
and 18 short papers divided into six
[SPEAKER_08]: sessions and a panel discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ask me what is my own take on the
conference, I will say that it is the only
[SPEAKER_08]: forum in Jamaica where I believe we all
can get legally high on cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very well said.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir Watson, at this time we're gonna segue
into a little entertainment.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna invite Mr. Joel Wright,
saxophonist and cellist, to give us a
[SPEAKER_13]: little entertainment before we get to the
real meat of the matter from our main
[SPEAKER_13]: presenter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birds flying high You know how I feel Sun
in the sky You know how I feel Blossom on
[SPEAKER_02]: a tree You know how I feel It's a new dawn
It's a new day And it's a new life For me
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm feeling Fish
[SPEAKER_02]: in the sea You know how I feel River

[SPEAKER_02]: on a tree You know how I feel It's a new
dawn It's a new day And it's a new life
[SPEAKER_02]: For me And I'm feeling

peace when day's done That's what I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: And this whole world is a new world And
I'm over For me For me
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful performance there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That particular brand of music,
the musicians are usually high.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that song we could tweak a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: See, every time I say I'm feeling good,
I keep expecting him to say I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is that, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Joel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some housekeeping with the driver of a
Honda Accord, a dark grey Honda Accord,
[SPEAKER_13]: license number 0981EN.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to attend to your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a security issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the driver of a dark grey Honda Accord,
0981EN, please attend to your vehicle at
[SPEAKER_13]: this time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, it is indeed my pleasure to introduce
our guest speaker for the evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: But before I bring him up, I would like us
all to give a round of applause because he
[SPEAKER_13]: was recently awarded an O.D.
[SPEAKER_13]: for his extensive service, his stellar
service to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's give him a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now there's only one thing for me to
do, to mention and make welcome,
[SPEAKER_13]: ladies and gentlemen, our guest speaker
for the evening, the principal of the UWI,
[SPEAKER_13]: chairman of the cannabis commercial and
medicinal research task force.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Professor Archibald MacDonald.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come here, Mr. Campbell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me begin by thanking you for the
introduction, but probably more
[SPEAKER_06]: importantly, thanking you and the speakers
before me for really moving things along.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm truly impressed with the way you have
moved things along.
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, I would like to thank you
if I continue, if I go on for some time,
[SPEAKER_06]: people should not be falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize Minister Paul Well in his
absence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, he said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He could have written my speech.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assure him, though, that tonight there
will be no criticism of the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Paul Well, in fact, introduced in his
brief presentation a number of the areas
[SPEAKER_06]: that I will mention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize the chairperson or
chairman, chairperson of SRC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize Mr. Watson, the acting
executive director of the SRC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sir, I thank you so much for lifting
the burden of the principalship from my
[SPEAKER_06]: shoulders, for lifting the burden of
worrying about what I say in my capacity
[SPEAKER_06]: of principal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can truly speak freely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without worrying about the consequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm speaking as chairman of yet it's a
long title, the Cannabis Commercial and
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicine and Research Task Force.
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognize at the head table Ms. Mona
White.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me also recognize Professor Henry
Low, my friend and colleague.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize Professor Morrison,
the director general of the National
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission of Science and Technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish to recognize a number of my
UWI colleagues because they will not
[SPEAKER_06]: forgive me if I don't do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize, let me give him the
title of principal emeritus, Professor
[SPEAKER_06]: Layla.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me also recognize members of
Diplomatic Corps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me recognize my partners and
colleagues, especially those who are from
[SPEAKER_06]: overseas, Canada, Colorado and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me welcome you to this conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: This conference entitled Green,
Gold, Medicinal, Ganja and Other Natural
[SPEAKER_06]: Products, a Potential Source of Wealth,
is timely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is being held at a time when profound
changes are taking place all over the
[SPEAKER_06]: world regarding the change in regime
concerning marijuana usage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The conference is taking place at a time
when the American people have asserted
[SPEAKER_06]: people power in achieving new victories in
the 2014 midterm US elections in
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship to ganja legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just, Mr. Watson, I applaud you
for the theme of the conference but I
[SPEAKER_06]: would just like with your permission to
add health to the title.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed Cedrani should read A Source of Wealth
and Health.
[SPEAKER_06]: We welcome all the participants to the
conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we will learn from the global
presenters and also that they too may
[SPEAKER_06]: learn something from our experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I congratulate the acting director again
and his team at the Scientific Research
[SPEAKER_06]: Council for organizing this conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me thank you for inviting me to
give this keynote address.
[SPEAKER_06]: I truly consider it an honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've entitled this talk, Ganja Reform in
Jamaica, a Call for the Transformation of
[SPEAKER_06]: International Treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Permit me to take this opportunity to pay
tribute to firstly the lobbies who over
[SPEAKER_06]: the years had their lonely moments but
endure to the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can think of the role of Dr. Ronald G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lampard from St. Thomas in his continuous
and relentless campaign for changing the
[SPEAKER_06]: ganja law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please applaud Dr. Lampard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pay my deepest respect to Peter Tosh for
his militant campaign nationally and
[SPEAKER_06]: internationally for the legalization of
ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: His tragic experiences with police
brutality epitomize the general harshness
[SPEAKER_06]: of law enforcement against people from the
lower class and members of the Rastafarian
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ganja law of 1913 is just an example
every year over 100 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: This age alone suggests the urgency for
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are in a different time and in a
different setting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking at the one love concert at the
National Stadium in 1976, Tosh called upon
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Manley, then Prime Minister,
and Edward Seattle who was then the leader
[SPEAKER_06]: of the opposition and all MPs in the words
of his son, come together to change the
[SPEAKER_06]: ganja law in order to discontinue its
oppressive injustice and also to inspire
[SPEAKER_06]: the development of ganja for medicinal and
industrial purposes leading to national
[SPEAKER_06]: development.
[SPEAKER_06]: This prophetic assertion in 1976
manifested in 2014 when both sides of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Houses of Parliament voted in favor of
profound changes in the ganja law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ganja has become a unifying force in the
land where political tribalism thrives.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is important to also pay tribute to
Honorable Mark Holden for his significant
[SPEAKER_06]: role as the architect of the new regime
for ganja in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the minister is not here,
but he needs to look at the Jamaica
[SPEAKER_06]: Constabulary Act and the excessive power
the police force hold in the war against
[SPEAKER_06]: ganja and its more brutal application
against lower class people in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to pay tribute to the
thousands of Jamaicans mainly from the
[SPEAKER_06]: lower class and the Rastafari community
who suffered the brunt of the injustice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally know many young men some of
them my relatives and friends who were
[SPEAKER_06]: turned into criminals because they were
found with a single ganja spliff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before moving to the global setting let me
applaud all those and their many who have
[SPEAKER_06]: played a part and are playing a role in
the broad coalition working for the
[SPEAKER_06]: decriminalization and the development of a
ganja industry in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me too join the minister in applauding
Professor Henry Low for launching many
[SPEAKER_06]: ganja and putting products on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is innovation in action.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us applaud him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us now examine the situation in
several countries to illustrate the
[SPEAKER_06]: changes taking place around the world in
relation to ganja usage and the
[SPEAKER_06]: development of a ganja industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us first look at the United States and
Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the recently held 2014 US midterm
elections, Alaska and Oregon joined
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado and Washington state to legalize
ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington DC also voted in support of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, less well known is that
several citizen towns across the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States also backed moves to allow ganja
smoking within their own boundaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Voters in two major conurbations in New
Mexico, Albuquerque and Santa Fe also
[SPEAKER_06]: overwhelmingly backed a change in the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: In doing so, the towns have set the local
police in a quandary with officers having
[SPEAKER_06]: to choose whether to continue to enforce
state laws banning marijuana or local
[SPEAKER_06]: statutes which allow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The result is a patchwork situation with
police in some areas enforcing local
[SPEAKER_06]: ordinances and not arresting people with
small amounts of ganja and others still
[SPEAKER_06]: applying state bans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, in California, possession of up
to an ounce of ganja is treated in the
[SPEAKER_06]: same way as a speeding ticket with a fine
but no criminal record and this is
[SPEAKER_06]: important because even a minor criminal
conviction can lead to problems like
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a job, a loan, a home and can even
lead to deportation.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2016, the following states will put
legalization on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Massachusetts, California, Hawaii,
Missouri, Maine, Nevada and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't need to tell you what the
results will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: The medical marijuana community in the
United States has shown immense benefits,
[SPEAKER_06]: have shown the immense benefits of
cannabis for helping the sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have also shown the possibility of
increased earning through taxation from
[SPEAKER_06]: legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: The returns in these states have been
impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is important to note also that there is
legal medical marijuana in 23 states in
[SPEAKER_06]: the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is decriminalization in about 14
states.
[SPEAKER_06]: The figures in America are constantly
changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is noticeable in the United States is
the campaign on the ground, the
[SPEAKER_06]: professionals and the grassroot movements.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really a people's movement that is
using ganja to transform.
[SPEAKER_06]: US politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Canada, in some areas, the struggle for
change is led by the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other areas, believe it or not,
by the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Police and prosecution services in
Canadian jurisdictions are capable of
[SPEAKER_06]: pursuing criminal charges for cannabis
possession.
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite this, the legal status of cannabis
in Canada is under dispute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Superior and appellate courts in Ontario
have repeatedly declared Canada's cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: laws to be no force and or effect if a
prescription is obtained.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, challenges to cannabis laws at a
federal level have not resulted in the
[SPEAKER_06]: deletion of the appropriate articles from
the Criminal Code of Canada and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cultivation of hemp, a plant of the
genus cannabis, family cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: is currently legal in Canada under
licenses issued by Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been informed that hemp,
or it is questionable whether hemp is
[SPEAKER_06]: legal in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Several polls since 2003 have found that
the majority of Canadians agree with the
[SPEAKER_06]: statement, the use of marijuana should be
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: A 2014 poll conducted by Angus Reid Global
shows that 59% of Canadians support
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana legalization, with the strongest
support in British Columbia and among men.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada has produced two useful studies and
provided instructive approach and guide to
[SPEAKER_06]: prepare papers calling for changes in the
international treaties concerning
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada, like the USA and the Netherlands,
are the main countries in the north
[SPEAKER_06]: planting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Latin America, important changes have
taken place in countries like Argentina,
[SPEAKER_06]: Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico,
and Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_06]: In many of these countries, their main
concern is curbing crime through
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization of ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Uruguay, ganja is a legal substance.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is evidence changes in some major
European countries are taking place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Countries such as Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Luxembourg, Germany,
[SPEAKER_06]: France, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, and Greece.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is not much information on Africa,
but there are calls for changes in the
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana laws in West Africa,
Zimbabwe, and South Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Globally, cannabis is still illegal in the
majority of countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, many countries have
decriminalized, allowing the possession of
[SPEAKER_06]: or growing of small quantities of ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even more countries allow the use of ganja
for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of these countries is rapidly
increasing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The global picture just described tells us
that there are major changes in the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the time is right to call for changes
in the international treaties governing
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was given a lecture by the minister in
one of my discussions with him,
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing for the legalization of ganja,
and he brought to my attention the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that Jamaica is a signatory on these
treaties and had to upon the treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that fully, but it also is
important that we reexamine these treaties
[SPEAKER_06]: now because it is impeding the trade
across borders.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the basis of research, I think it is
time for the ministers of foreign affairs,
[SPEAKER_06]: including our own ministers, the minister
here and the ministers in Karakom,
[SPEAKER_06]: the ministers of foreign trade and
international trade, foreign affairs and
[SPEAKER_06]: international trade, to be contacted with
a position paper for and about changes in
[SPEAKER_06]: the international treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me share with you some notes from the
Canadian Special Senate Committee,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was established in 2002.
[SPEAKER_06]: The committee makes a charge for profound
changes in the international legal
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: The political justification of the
position is preceded by three important
[SPEAKER_06]: observations of the international
treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Firstly, there is a major problem
regarding definitions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The terms drugs, narcotics, and
psychotropics are not defined in any way
[SPEAKER_06]: except as an additional list of products
included in the schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: The arbitrary and inconsistent nature of
the classification is another point of
[SPEAKER_06]: concern.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is included along with heroin and
cocaine in schedules one and four of the
[SPEAKER_06]: 1961 convention, which carries the most
stringent controls.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not even mentioned by name in the
1971 protocols, though THC is listed as a
[SPEAKER_06]: schedule one psychotropic drug with
mescaline and LSD.
[SPEAKER_06]: The concerns about the dangers of drugs
and public health are not consistent
[SPEAKER_06]: regarding to the use of alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the 2002 Canadian Senate
Court, we conclude, and I'm quoting,
[SPEAKER_06]: we conclude from these observations that
the international regime for the control
[SPEAKER_06]: and prohibition of psychoactive substances
beyond any moral or even racist roots,
[SPEAKER_06]: it may initially have its first and
foremost a system that reflects the
[SPEAKER_06]: geopolitics of North-South relations in
the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed, the strictest controls were placed
on organic substances such as the cocoa
[SPEAKER_06]: bush, the poppy, and the cannabis plant,
which often form part of the ancestral
[SPEAKER_06]: traditions of the countries where these
plants originate, whereas the North's
[SPEAKER_06]: cultural products, alcohol and tobacco,
were ignored, and the synthetic substances
[SPEAKER_06]: produced by the North's pharmaceutical
industries were subject to regulation,
[SPEAKER_06]: not prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 1988 convention forced countries in
the South to apply the force of that
[SPEAKER_06]: convention on their own people,
and it is still being applied today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Several international commissions have
conducted research and concluded with
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific findings demystifying the myths
and anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those findings received renewed attention
during the 1990s, but in the facts of
[SPEAKER_06]: facts, myths, rule, it is important to
look at some of these works and their
[SPEAKER_06]: contribution to the debate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us look at the work of the Indian
Health Commission in 1894, a most detailed
[SPEAKER_06]: and systematic study of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission took place in India from
1993 to 1994, looking at every aspect of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis use, about the history of the
plant, the history of spiritual and
[SPEAKER_06]: medical uses, and a view of how the elite
view the lower-class citizens who smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission did not link cannabis
smoking to any evil whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: The report shows that the Indian elites
view ganja as a drug for lower-class
[SPEAKER_06]: Indian laborers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ganja smoking was associated with work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there is the LaGuardia Committee
report, 1930 to 1944.
[SPEAKER_06]: The New York Academy of Medicine
established a committee composed of eight
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians, a psychologist, and four New
York city officials.
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission did not establish any
relationship between marijuana smoking and
[SPEAKER_06]: crime and violence.
[SPEAKER_06]: It concluded that marijuana has no
specific stimulant effect in regard to
[SPEAKER_06]: sexual desires, and that marijuana does
not lead to the use of other drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many smokers having a long history of
cannabis use was examined by the
[SPEAKER_06]: researchers who found, interestingly
enough, that marijuana users were not
[SPEAKER_06]: inferior, were not of inferior
intelligence to the general population,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they suffered no mental or
physical deterioration as a result of the
[SPEAKER_06]: use of the drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me repeat.
[SPEAKER_06]: These findings are scientific findings.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't represent even, they are not my
opinion, although I agree with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me declare that these are scientific
findings.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let us look at the National Commission
on Marijuana and Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: This commission was established by the
United States Congress and President Nixon
[SPEAKER_06]: under the chairmanship of Raymond
Schaffer, a former governor of
[SPEAKER_06]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_06]: And its initial findings were published in
1972.
[SPEAKER_06]: According to this commission, there is
little proven danger of the physical or
[SPEAKER_06]: psychological harm from the use of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also concluded that the existing
social and legal policy is out of
[SPEAKER_06]: proportion to the individual and social
harm engendered by the drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I repeat, that study was commissioned
by the United States Senate and sanctioned
[SPEAKER_06]: by the President Nixon at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me tell you about what is probably
regarded by scholars as maybe the most
[SPEAKER_06]: important study on ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: This research is a big secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many people know about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The publication from this project is
located right here at the UWI library,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we found it a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really in very poor condition,
and we have restored it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This study was conducted by Lambrus
Cometas and Vera Rubin of the Research
[SPEAKER_06]: Institute for the Study of Man out of New
York.
[SPEAKER_06]: The research was conducted between 1970 to
1970, and 1972, the era of Nixon's war
[SPEAKER_06]: against drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a thrust to conduct research in
countries where there is chronic ganja
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, and therefore, no surprise,
Jamaica was selected.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sponsored by the National Institute
for Mental Health out of the USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a multi-center study and included
reputable universities from across the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States such as the prestigious Ivy
League University, Columbia University,
[SPEAKER_06]: and from the UK, Birmingham University.
[SPEAKER_06]: They collaborated with the University of
the West Indies, and let me remind you,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're talking about 1970 to 1972,
to examine the anthropological,
[SPEAKER_06]: medical, and psychological effects of
users and non-users of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The subjects in the study ranged from age
23 to 53 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And were drawn from all sections of our
society, farmers, fishermen, artisans,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the trades people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The report provides an extensive account
of the Indian Hemp Commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: It refused the charges of the so-called
demotivation syndrome and low productivity
[SPEAKER_06]: among ganja users.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also found no evidence of cognitive
impairment in users of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The researchers found no evidence that
heavy use of cannabis results in permanent
[SPEAKER_06]: cognitive impairment.
[SPEAKER_06]: The report was handed over to our own
Minister of Health in 1972, the Honorable
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Ken McNeil.
[SPEAKER_06]: The National Academy of Science report of
1982.
[SPEAKER_06]: This commission came at a time that may
have been the turning point in the 1980s,
[SPEAKER_06]: 1990s, leading to the renewal of pot
politics in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the past four years, marijuana has
been accused of an array of anti-social
[SPEAKER_06]: effects, including increasing crime and
violence, leading to heroin addiction,
[SPEAKER_06]: and destroying the work ethic of young
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: This commission, the National Academy of
Science report, concluded that these
[SPEAKER_06]: charges have not been substantiated by the
scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: The opponents of changes in marijuana laws
are convincing in the spread of rumors.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it is critical that the social
concerns are addressed through an
[SPEAKER_06]: aggressive public education program.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a number of questions which are
asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the risk of the undersmoking to
public order?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the risk of the undersmoking to
public order?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the risk of the undersmoking to
public order?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the risk of the undersmoking to
public order?
[SPEAKER_06]: Drinking ganja leads to deviant behavior
and increasing crime and violence.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact is that the experience in places
like Colorado is exactly the opposite.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the effects on mental health?
[SPEAKER_06]: And does it lead to insanity?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the effects on memory and
cognition?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are the effects on sexual
reproduction?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the effects on motivation and
academic work, academic and work
[SPEAKER_06]: performance?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are ganja smokers underachievers and the
last generation?
[SPEAKER_06]: All these concerns, ladies and gentlemen,
have been demystified by the above
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned, and these are only a few
studies and commissions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially let me draw your attention
again to the report from Commitus and
[SPEAKER_06]: Rubin, which was conducted right here in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: This report uses extensively the voice of
the subjects and all of the above,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the above concerns have been
demystified.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is interesting that both overseas and
local research on ganja smoking and
[SPEAKER_06]: academic work and performance,
all the research done locally and
[SPEAKER_06]: internationally on the effects on academic
work and performance showed high academic
[SPEAKER_06]: performance amongst ganja smokers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is frightening in a positive way to
hear that examining students in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States of America and the results from the
Commitus and Rubin study in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_06]: illustrate, believe it or not,
that ganja smokers do better.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they do exceptionally well,
and these are not my words, academically.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what the science shows,
but let me caution that it is not the case
[SPEAKER_06]: and not desirable for underaged young
people to think that it is good for them
[SPEAKER_06]: and their schoolwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what the science shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, let us replace rumors
with the scientific facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Canadians have done a lot of work in
the area of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Senate Special Committee was
established 30 years after the Ledin
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the Senate Committee in 2002 and
the Ledin Commission in 1972 on the
[SPEAKER_06]: non-medical use of drugs, studying some of
the same issues from the early inquiry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission suggests that the new
policy and psychoactive substances must be
[SPEAKER_06]: structured around principles respecting
the life, health, security, and the rights
[SPEAKER_06]: and freedoms of individuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: The major theme of the study are use of
marijuana for therapeutic purposes,
[SPEAKER_06]: the national legislative context,
and regulating the therapeutic use of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: This report is a hallmark study in the
call for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the mid-1970s, the Western world,
accustomed to hemp, rope, and cordage,
[SPEAKER_06]: discovered that the plant that produces
hemp affords potential therapeutic and
[SPEAKER_06]: psychoactive properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was introduced by a British physician
who had been working in India where
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis has been used in that country for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not used in Western medicine until
the third of the 20th century for the
[SPEAKER_06]: treatment of both organic complaints and
mental illness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The medical use of cannabis was
discouraged by the marijuana tax act of
[SPEAKER_06]: 1937.
[SPEAKER_06]: The therapeutic uses of cannabis is well
documented with scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it is the politicians who are the
barriers to approval of legislation,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm glad my friend is not here,
to the approval of legislation to
[SPEAKER_06]: transform and reform ganja law.
[SPEAKER_06]: As early as 1982, Congressman,
believe it or not, conservative Newt
[SPEAKER_06]: Gingrich wrote in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, federal laws
[SPEAKER_06]: and medical marijuana were outdated,
depriving thousands of glaucoma and cancer
[SPEAKER_06]: patients medical care.
[SPEAKER_06]: He continued to state that this theory
about drug abuse has prevented a rational
[SPEAKER_06]: assessment of the therapeutic use of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: In recent years, he has been renewed
interest in the medical marijuana in the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both countries have important places to
offer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Firstly, the role of public education,
lobbying, and people on the ground moving
[SPEAKER_06]: the politics towards a favorable direction
in support of medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_06]: and also for the non-medical use of
marijuana as we saw in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Canadian Senate Special Committee of
2002 provides important lessons towards a
[SPEAKER_06]: campaign for the use of marijuana for
therapeutic purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of their views on medical marijuana
are marijuana has long been established as
[SPEAKER_06]: a non-dangerous drug, and that there are
clear indications that marijuana has
[SPEAKER_06]: therapeutic uses, and this now is well
known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Analgesics for chronic pain, antispasms
for multiple sclerosis, anticonvulsant for
[SPEAKER_06]: epilepsy, antiemetic, especially for
cancer patients on chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_06]: is an appetite stimulant for cocaxia,
and the use in glaucoma is well known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our own Professor Mandela West has been
producing Canisal.
[SPEAKER_06]: The study argues that the natural taste is
far superior to the artificial version.
[SPEAKER_06]: It called upon Health Canada to lead
research and implementation of new
[SPEAKER_06]: policies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The extent to which cannabis can serve
humanity is almost without boundary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us examine the drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is used by chemotherapy patients,
and those patients with illnesses
[SPEAKER_06]: associated with nausea and vomiting has
proven to be very effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is most useful in treating malnutrition
in HIV and cancer patients, and also
[SPEAKER_06]: useful in patients with neurological
disorders, spinal cord injury,
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple sclerosis, and patients suffering
from muscle spasticity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And much of these, some of you who are
seeing it will see Sandra Gupta,
[SPEAKER_06]: who's a reputable neurosurgeon.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Institute of Medicine published
Marijuana and Medicine in 1999.
[SPEAKER_06]: This book provides a useful guide on this
topic, and I recommend it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana and Medicine in 1999,
published by the Institute of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It provides details of the use of
marijuana to treat movement disorder,
[SPEAKER_06]: dystonia, Huntington's disease,
Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the case of epilepsy, a study shows
that men who use marijuana have fewer
[SPEAKER_06]: first-time seizures than those who did
not.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are increasing clinical trials with
cure cannabis in epileptics, showing a
[SPEAKER_06]: reduction in seizures in patients,
and I don't need to dwell on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is well known.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also supported, discussed by Sandra Gupta
on CNN.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabinoids are important in treating
Alzheimer's disease, as well as dark
[SPEAKER_06]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these studies from the 1940s,
70s, and the 80s have provided the
[SPEAKER_06]: strongest scientific evidence on ganja
use, dispelling the myths and the
[SPEAKER_06]: anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a discriminatory view.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a discriminatory view of ganja
and ganja smokers by the upper and middle
[SPEAKER_06]: classes, and some Christians from the
religious right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hold onto the view that ganja smoking
is psychologically and physically
[SPEAKER_06]: damaging, that it is a precipitant of
violence and anti-social behavior.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as revolutionary acts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wider society have to be concerned about
this and develop effective public
[SPEAKER_06]: education program that will help to
alleviate these fears.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to seize the opportunity and use
the popularity of this ganja issue to deal
[SPEAKER_06]: with matters concerning the wider Jamaican
society.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me tell you that as chairman of
the task force, the alum name,
[SPEAKER_06]: as chairman, I'm amazed by the broad
coalition which we have managed to put
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the minister, it's quite
appropriate, or the director, and he had
[SPEAKER_06]: to approve it, I know, that the green is
used in the theme, because I tell you,
[SPEAKER_06]: that both parties are represented on the
task force.
[SPEAKER_06]: Against this backbone, we may need a
German-styled scientific literacy program
[SPEAKER_06]: for the formal and informal spheres of
education in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: A basic understanding of science helps in
two ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: It increases appreciation for scientific
research results, and secondly,
[SPEAKER_06]: to encourage innovation at the point of
use in the everyday lived experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: For farmers, the food and plant processes
in the areas of engineering and in animal
[SPEAKER_06]: and plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_06]: This matter concerning legalization of
ganja and wealth creation has indeed
[SPEAKER_06]: attracted a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the 1960s, the Rastafarians created
a lot of interest, and the principal of
[SPEAKER_06]: the University of the West Indies was
requested by Mr. Manly to go on a
[SPEAKER_06]: fact-finding mission to eliminate this
important social phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2014, let me reclaim my principal's
hat.
[SPEAKER_06]: This principal aims to play a pivotal role
in the development of a new ganja regime,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in the area of medical
marijuana, as well as calling for reforms
[SPEAKER_06]: in the global treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all persons can be ganja farmers or
processors of the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I've observed is enthusiasm regarding
the application of science to the plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: to the ganja plant, for medical and
industrial purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We must seize this moment, we must use
this moment to inspire greater interest in
[SPEAKER_06]: the scientific exploitation of other
medicinal plants and agriculture in
[SPEAKER_06]: general.
[SPEAKER_06]: Students, including mature students,
do better when they are able to apply
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific principles to everyday life.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do better, and I pause to tell you
the story of my son.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't tell you which high school,
but I was very badly in the sciences and
[SPEAKER_06]: mathematics, and I had to go home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him going down, and I had to,
just before his CSEC exams, I had to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to study again, and took him through
it, and he had a particular difficulty
[SPEAKER_06]: with chemistry, and I started teaching him
chemistry, and then I discovered that he
[SPEAKER_06]: could not connect with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a sudden disconnection.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, daddy, what is this nonsense?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the importance of this thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I started to show him the
practical applications, even around the
[SPEAKER_06]: house, suddenly he woke up, and he said,
daddy, this is a beautiful subject,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he got a distinction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you that we, the plant,
we must think about a wider society with a
[SPEAKER_06]: view to encourage what may evolve into a
long-awaited scientific revolution in
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is science, and not politics,
nor economics that develop countries,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can research that for yourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time that I have
witnessed discussions with such figure,
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at the scientific application of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: For this to be successful, there has to be
a science reform curriculum in both
[SPEAKER_06]: academic and vocational institutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also need to take sides to the everyday
lived experience, encouraging change from
[SPEAKER_06]: the ground up.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we proceed, as we develop business,
business is to create wealth from this
[SPEAKER_06]: billion-dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We must remember, and we must remember,
pardon me for referring to this so
[SPEAKER_06]: frequently, we must remember that ganja is
linked to the lives of lower-class and
[SPEAKER_06]: working people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us not forget that they bore the brunt
of injustice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ganja plays an important role in their
lives, from cultivation, marketing,
[SPEAKER_06]: as cash crops, as folk medicine,
and for some religious purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No ganja industry will survive unless they
are involved in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some sensitive issues that will
not be solved overnight as the laws are
[SPEAKER_06]: changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we prepare to do business, we must
think not just the future growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the existing growers, and how we make
this transition smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is important for the new public policy
to be accompanied by a public education
[SPEAKER_06]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_06]: In closing, ladies and gentlemen,
the scientific evidence is overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_06]: even as we move to do more clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: The scientific evidence is overwhelming,
even as we move to do more clinical
[SPEAKER_06]: trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ganja must be regarded as a medicine and
not as a dangerous drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us replace myths and anecdotes with
scientific facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the chairman of the council is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: In order to do business across borders,
we must call for the reform, for reforms
[SPEAKER_06]: in international treaties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us call on governments, including our
own government, and also the governments
[SPEAKER_06]: in CARICOM, to use diplomatic channels to
start the work to get these treaties and
[SPEAKER_06]: conventions amended.
[SPEAKER_06]: I repeat, let us seize the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We must use the enthusiasm about the ganja
plant and its scientific values to begin
[SPEAKER_06]: the revolution in scientific and
technological education in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call for the development of a
Jamal-style educational program in science
[SPEAKER_06]: in Jamaica using the discussions about
ganja as the launch pad.
[SPEAKER_06]: The University of the West Indies' Mona
campus stands ready to assist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me say, Prof, I've done my own
research, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have some facts.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we won't get into that right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually want to be included in any more
studies you have as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna ask you
not to leave.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna ask you not to leave just yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a very special presentation that
will be made to our guests speaker in just
[SPEAKER_13]: a way of saying thanks for being a part of
this and for working with such vigor and
[SPEAKER_13]: such enthusiasm to make this that he's
pushing forward a reality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the
SRC, and of course of all of us,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're gonna ask Ms. Roslyn Fisher to make
a presentation to Professor Archibald.
[SPEAKER_05]: Professor Archibald, on behalf of the SRC
family, and the scientific community,
[SPEAKER_05]: we want to say thank you for this
enlightening and maybe high grade
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just a token of our
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we say thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much, Ms. Fisher.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course the proceedings are not
quite over yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one more formality to do,
which I'm gonna invite you to be a little
[SPEAKER_13]: patient.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me make some announcements.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to remind you that coming up in
the next two days, tomorrow's conference
[SPEAKER_13]: will have with it a panel discussion.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course the guest speaker and the
persons on the panel will be introduced to
[SPEAKER_13]: you in all the literature that exists.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's going to be very exciting come
tomorrow and Wednesday when we have the
[SPEAKER_13]: presentation of the Scientific Research
Council Awards for Innovation and
[SPEAKER_13]: Inventors.
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time I want to invite to the
podium to do her very, very, very,
[SPEAKER_13]: very special task.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a wonderful lady.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had the pleasure of meeting her just
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Feel like I know her forever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna invite to do the vote of thanks
Ms. Mona White, the manager, Mrs. I beg
[SPEAKER_13]: your pardon.
[SPEAKER_13]: You see, I'm looking to try and squeeze.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't take it off and leave it on the
table.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not here, don't he?
[SPEAKER_13]: He's here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh good, you see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms. Mona White.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna invite Mrs. Mona White,
the manager of information services
[SPEAKER_13]: division of the SRC to do the vote of
thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Mr. Campbell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're all anxious to go over there
to see the exhibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of you have been waiting to see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be very brief.
[SPEAKER_07]: All protocols observed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives me great pleasure to move the
vote of thanks this evening on behalf of
[SPEAKER_07]: the SRC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very special thanks to our guest speaker,
Professor Archibald MacDonald for his
[SPEAKER_07]: excellent presentation in taking us
through the evolution of Ganja and around
[SPEAKER_07]: the world looking at its development.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks also to our minister, honorable
minister, Philip Paulwell in absentia for
[SPEAKER_07]: bringing greetings on behalf of the
Ministry of Science, Technology,
[SPEAKER_07]: Energy and Mining.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our thanks go too to Ms. Melissa McCarch,
our board chairman, for bringing greetings
[SPEAKER_07]: on behalf of the SRC and for her
continuous encouragement and support.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to our sponsors and partners,
Jamaica Brawners Limited, J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray and Neville Limited, and Perishables
Jamaica Limited for tonight's opening
[SPEAKER_07]: ceremony and cocktail reception.
[SPEAKER_07]: To Herbal Blends, Timeless Herbal Care,
Guardian Life and Petra Caribe for the
[SPEAKER_07]: conference, for supporting the conference
and for the various types of support which
[SPEAKER_07]: they have so kindly consented to offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I pause here to pay particular tribute to
Mr. Courtney Betty from Timeless Herbal
[SPEAKER_07]: Care who is instrumental in bringing down,
to attend and be part of our conference,
[SPEAKER_07]: leading Jews expert in the world,
Dr. William Courtney and his wife Kristen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we have them stand up and be
recognized?
[SPEAKER_07]: We also wish to recognize another visitor
who is exhibiting with us from Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you stand and be recognized as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to the staff of the Pegasus Hotel
for the facilities associated with hosting
[SPEAKER_07]: this event and for providing us with such
delicious orders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our sincere thanks to the saxophone
cellist for the melodious sounds that he
[SPEAKER_07]: belted out as he kept us entertained.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thoroughly enjoyed his presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to the hardworking staff of the
Scientific Research Council for your
[SPEAKER_07]: support, in particular members of the
conference planning committee who worked
[SPEAKER_07]: alongside me and without whose input and
efforts this conference would not be what
[SPEAKER_07]: it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks in anticipation to the press who we
all know will cover this event in the
[SPEAKER_07]: appropriate forums.
[SPEAKER_07]: In an effort to keep the public informed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to our compare Mr. Courtney
Campbell for guiding tonight's proceedings
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course to you the audience a big
thank you for coming and making this event
[SPEAKER_07]: happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again thanks to all.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Thank
you. you
