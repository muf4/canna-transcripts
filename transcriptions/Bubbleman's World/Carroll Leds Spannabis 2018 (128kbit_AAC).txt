[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here at the 2018 Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to go check out Carol LEDs,
my good buddy Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, where did he go?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was here a second ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got these old school flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is!
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Carol LEDs in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carol LEDs in the house again.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my biggest supporters right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saved our ass at the Blue River Party a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking today, I got your back,
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of your biggest supporters,
so I thought maybe you could take us on
[SPEAKER_02]: camera and walk us through these old
school things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build them up to the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hey, it's no secret, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people like to hide their
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a dealer back in the day for many
years in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I acquired a lot of rare genetics,
but they were all coming from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when these genetics would appear,
I wanted that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would happen every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 pounds, only one seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will never forget that when that
seed popped out of that last bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much, that was left.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Richie was with me, and this is
no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was smoking, I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, pop!
[SPEAKER_01]: His exploded, spoke, just like a plane
going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was seeing things when the
seed dropped out a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, cut to the story of the crash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened then is that basically I
started trying to preserve genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: were from the 80s, alright?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically, as we've talked in the past,
trying to reintroduce that line into the
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been endangered.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it in captivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've been working with it in
Spain now for close to eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really did was we found some
very interesting diesel genetics that were
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the originals that were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with some of the very, very nice
sativas that were coming along at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, that was what I favored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just show you some of the rare
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a special treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now basically, you can see the super
orange haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that crystalline profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that nice, strong aroma in the
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, that vibrant orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these are leads, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these buds grown by the leads today
are kind of proof, you know, that now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working... Look at that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I never tire of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings back memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings back memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one was that again?
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there is the super orange haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super orange haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually won awards with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've won three dabadoos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Barcelona in 2016 with the first
brazen competition ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did win first with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was with the super orange haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later in time, there was the blueberry
haze, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also, as well, is a very unique,
very terpy bud profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost kind of a cheese mix, I would kind
of call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of see the blue hues and
really taste that profile when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or also just doing an old-fashioned bong
hit, as I am very famous for my bong hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love smoking with that bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love really having something that's
unique, something that's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a cultivar that came
along and I preserved it along with silver
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal spray, you know, using my fems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a strong believer in regular seeds
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I clone, you know, I do the
feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that really you need to maintain
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so basically this is an incredible
strain that I call it greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that I call it that is that
greasy profile that comes off when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, what we want, we're hash farmers,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tricholminers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smell that, you smell those
turps, that comes off in that rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been in the competition
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will be competing next year with
that greasy strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a wonderful 1980s treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been kept apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you guys, I appreciate you
and I support Full Land 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is legend, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as I've always said and I've
repeated, winners come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legends are forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man is a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get you in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to know that you're a legend,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the kind words.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta show your lights, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known you for many years,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: True, you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it's what all those things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what all those things are.
It's what all those things are.
It's what all those things are.
