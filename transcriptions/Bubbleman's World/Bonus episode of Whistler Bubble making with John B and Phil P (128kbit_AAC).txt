[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with John B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got together for the first time in
what seems like... 14 days or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did we make the My Little Pony
bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be the Wednesday ago,
a week and 7, 8, 9, 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days ago we did a trip to Whistler and
we made some bubble hash next to Chicamas
[SPEAKER_00]: Creek with Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bubble has been sitting out on
cardboard and drying in my Gorilla Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, completely sealed from the
environment in a nice low 30% humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now kind of ready to get it off
the cardboard and get it into the little
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm scraping and collecting,
John's going to tell you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've told you about it before,
but he's going to tell you again and
[SPEAKER_00]: then...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to talk, I'll be the guy
scraping resin in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scraping resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, this is what we have
rammed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about half of what you see in
the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about half of what's sitting out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's roughly about 2, 4, 6,
8, 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So roughly what we're seeing here in the
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice string.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossed with a Skunk Haze NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk a lot about this right now
because it was from 1992.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was written on my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a handwritten.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had an SKNL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a Northern Lake Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of... We're talking about it
because I called it Medi My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also crossed with another
string that I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's kind of the story behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another buddy over today and the
first thing he said is, I remember that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that Northern Lake Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely got an old school smell to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely got an old school smell to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are old school beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something I've collected over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't even really recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even recall where they actually
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a little video that I said in
the past that I actually have a speed call
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was running the other strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some Barney's that might have
someone that had both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just actually going to give a quick
tip here while doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is quite helpful to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're getting a nice sticky bubble
off like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten it down to a nice powder
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still a little bit sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just go straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I go at an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of go real slow to avoid the
shooting bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flicking shooting bubble that just
releases and shoots off the cardboard into
[SPEAKER_00]: the great unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick little tip not to cut John
off on his My Little Pony story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it when I'm cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be a glazer by trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was after my accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to clean the glass with a
razor blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you cleaned it on an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I do exactly the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing to actually just point
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color on this is absolutely
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely we will just get it into
its container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get this cardboard off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get the next one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why have you written all these containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know dollar stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that will get us to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe these little slick pads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get them into the oil slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's the dry sift that I got from
my DK420 PG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes that is the treat that I brought to
you from the man himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah great guys out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to... It was great to spend
time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just all of them were just really good
dudes I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing about my little pony when I
always run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we discussed this before I was on
the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really everybody always wants to get
this great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really comes down to the growner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me organic growing is what I've
always... When I changed over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Mason suggested to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did stuff in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it wasn't really melting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the days I wasn't always
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well nutrient A is many one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't using an all organic base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what's working for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely working for you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We flushed for at least 35 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just lost water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting the plant go to term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting it finish off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not cutting it to a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually letting the plant go all the way
until it stops actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's little things that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually help me achieve this
actually beautiful bubble hash that I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well as you've seen over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality happens in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm constantly getting very good
quality in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can attest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bit of a snob.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to what you're doing
in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me it's controlling my
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here let me grab the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got these sitting on the 4 by 2
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been completely protected for
the last 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's clean so you can turn it
sideways if you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty nice 160 I've got to
admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little piece of my own pressed
hash on there accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice sound anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well this 120 is what I've seen actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've ran the same kind of patch now
three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing this definitely a bigger
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made mention it come down to the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually zero degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad we used cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water was ice cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice wasn't melting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the temperatures with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything just being so cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually you discussed about being in a
freezer in the past and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice cold environment when we
made this hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came off the screens perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water was just glacier cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still used a ton of ice which was
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just make sure we got the cleanest
possible screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though your 160 was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why bother contaminating any of the 120?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the amount is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we've done half the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely covered the entire piece
of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going up to the river next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want, rent a sled and come with
us to the backcountry and we'll do it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ice cave man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your resin deserves to be made in an ice
cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it popping when we're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little minis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited because I guess you would
really have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you do understand but
when you spend four months working on
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some beautiful medicine and then
it comes into a pile that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a beautiful thing.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice pile of 120 I can tell you
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know and you're just like oh fuck man.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh excuse that language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we didn't run a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I've obviously seen giant piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep running all the time.
It's great man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: For what I've seen from what I've been
cutting roughly into our Rubbermaid bin
[SPEAKER_01]: which you've seen in some of the other
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's roughly about 400 to 430 grams of
fresh and this is what I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 90 maybe just under 100 grams of
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice little pile man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to spin her around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spin her around?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like said even that 160 looks marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard not to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually discussing with a friend
today and I was showing him the different
[SPEAKER_01]: grades and he was talking about yeah I got
a two bag system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like two bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a two bag system?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah we do that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to do things for years but
what's even cooler is to accept that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn and constantly better yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for years too and
trust me we're learning every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you people right now are
cringing that this is on cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey John put some on parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just did a little picture of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming off beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well right away I think we have to hit
each one and just talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really the final part to our
Whistler video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say let's just put that back
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about that 190 for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really the one that you want to
keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it for several different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking oil slick today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping on becoming their northwest
distributor up here in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest in Canada anyway for these oil
slick products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've absolutely been stoked on these
little stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know these are full of dry sift that I
made while I was up in my last video with
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little glass light proof jars that
you can't see through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's your 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John what would you like to start with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I'm really stoked to start working
with oil slick nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've been keeping my
product in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a product for oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great for bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great for dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going right for 90 did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to get back and hang out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have all your beautiful herbs surrounding
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your resin is absolutely delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with this particular bubble what
I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I've done now with my
dab kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might go more along the lines of
the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well all it was melt instantly and stick
to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not having good success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm thinking is heat the dabber up
and then dip it in to this 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah that's crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love holding the pipe from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
This is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's like the smell and the flavor is
definitely very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells like my little pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about does it have
really that haze smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really trying to determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not haze to me but there's a unique
taste in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's undertones that are almost
unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just remind me of old things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's what it had the date on 92 and
I know that's pretty clear so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that was a great hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you it's eye closing hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally makes you want to close your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that we could wait for two full
weeks and just leave it be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really in my opinion the kicker
in properly drawing bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you know what like I'm feeling very
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm eating more right now because I'm
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say about properly drawing
bubble and how you can tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences and I've learned this really
just in playing with full mount dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure 99 percent head dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I squeeze dry sift together it's hard
right away and it's almost sometimes hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it flat and thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you push a dab together and it's
almost hard instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble very rarely does that because most
people's bubble is still moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has wet in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's not just grease all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times that bubble has
moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's degraded the wax membrane and it
might appear to look nicer but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation and to a hash smoker who's a
recognized not recognized but an
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced hash smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will feel the difference in their throats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little bit of harshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must have as being a judge this year
at legends and sitting with the heavies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are serious hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh serious hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not doing it for any
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing it for any like to be in
a magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like that's who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take it very seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what was so great about
being able to judge them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking with them and it's just the
passion you see in people.
[SPEAKER_01]: For no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking over at you going you're
just like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so passionate about the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: John is definitely passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have made comments in the
YouTube videos like man I love how the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower is so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why John and I click because I'm in
the same boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people do grow I want them to
know how great it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you offer them that is you teach
them about purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know before we had bubble bags and
water extraction you know pre 99 you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people most people had never seen
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just didn't exist in a lot of
people's stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people haven't been you know exposed
to full melt dry sift or full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: pre 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are 15 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still hear people to this day and have
the gold seal on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and then you go to Amsterdam and they
have a little stuff please help yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine how they would never do
this in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's tiny little flakes little
pieces that didn't quite get microplane
[SPEAKER_00]: they got you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to separate those out because
they are they're just a different color
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look totally wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I just took a piece of with
that and hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well those are the best pieces to get
rid of right away because they're the most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to have trapped moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a piece that small the size of
the tip of a match head is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough to have moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it was a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fresh frozen batch in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it was a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I would say yeah out of what I
see sitting in front of me I'm cold cold
[SPEAKER_01]: cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been saying that to me ever
since I met you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it cold keep it cold keep it cold.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well doing it at zero degree temperatures
while it's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be getting up there sooner than
later hopefully into the Pemberton
[SPEAKER_00]: backcountry maybe the ice cave to do a
nice batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to get that done this
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it would be valid to show
some epic snowboarding epic skiing ski
[SPEAKER_00]: flying and sledding all mixed in with a
video where we go to the ice cave and make
[SPEAKER_00]: a fat batch of fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah just want to thank everyone for
watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue puffing bowls here
but we won't take up all your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah right on dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you again John.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back for Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
