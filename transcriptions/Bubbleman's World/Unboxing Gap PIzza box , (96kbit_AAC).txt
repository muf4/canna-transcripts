[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is I, the Bubble Man, and I'm here
today to do a little unboxing video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit of, let me see if I can't
clean the lens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing a couple of little three dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We welcome those dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today I wanted to do a quick
little video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll start with a dab, because that
always seems to be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautiful dabs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of really lovely things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna hit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little, little good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, see if I can't move that back a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think I can get a little bit more
height on the camera now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for my sketchiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I got this box right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a quick unboxing video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really cool new company that I
found here in Canada, so it might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: very good for my American listeners,
but I'm telling you from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a home that does not offer
delivery, really, at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little delivery that comes to
my house, and so lately I've been looking
[SPEAKER_00]: into a couple of different companies to
try and find food that can get delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: to my house, and that's what this box is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll shout out all the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nephalem Glass for the marble setup,
JP and Toro for the turpslerper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dustin Revere for the drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess we better thank Blazer for the
torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different groups to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I might have to hit that up a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some hash rosin I'm about to
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some strawberry banana hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just gonna take a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not looking to get completely torn right
this second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that was almost like a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you call a tiny, tiny little
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I mostly just did the dab to
make it seem appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this channel because this channel is
full-blown dab content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to show you guys this,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the General Pizza Assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company is called GAPizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gapizza.com if you want to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I live in a place where
very few people deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ordered from this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go check them out at GAPizza.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how the box arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a lift here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of dry ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do a little sifting later with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you're touching dry ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can burn and hurt your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was close right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what we got inside of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got these beautiful Italian-style
thin-crust pizzas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the Cheese Wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got provolone, mozzarella,
grana padana, and pecorino romano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for this pizza right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ordered two of these ones because I
thought I need two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got three of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mila margarita.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has mozzarella, grana padana,
and basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that particular pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, I actually got three of
these because margarita is actually my
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I got these plant-based
pizzas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a plant-based mozzarella,
pumpkin seed parmesan, and fresh basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has no dairy in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of a plant-based vegan
pizza, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually ended up getting three of
these as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to pull them all out,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eight pizzas in total cost me $80
Canadian dollars with delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They delivered them right to my door,
and I do not live in a close area for
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really stoked on this,
and I figured, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's be honest, we all know one of
the major side effects of inhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes is ordering
pizzas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, if you're in Canada anyway,
you might be able to do it in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you can't, but I know that
this is a Canadian company, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was able to order from them here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next unboxing video I'll be doing for
food is going to be the salad company that
[SPEAKER_00]: I found there called InspiredGo.ca or
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google that and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, I'm gonna take
another dab, because that first dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not much of a dab there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna put our second marble set
together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat this little guy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dab it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've actually done
many videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've been doing the Merlin,
getting baked with, getting cooked with
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be back for more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for sure happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Church is picking up steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mushroom conversation that I
wanna start having, a mushroom dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I'm gonna call that
show, but it's gonna end up on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so keep an eye out for all of
that content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these little unboxing videos of
something that's not actually a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that someone sent me, but actually
products that I myself have ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pizzas and then the salads as well
were just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe how fresh they arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ate them all before I was able to do
any type of unboxing video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to Dom and Max from Up and
Smoke, because those guys live in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can actually get my salads
delivered to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't deliver to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is nice to have good friends like
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of the many reasons why
I like to support those guys at Up and
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any cannabis needs and
you wanna go to the store to buy hash or
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and you wanna buy it from guys that
actually have deep knowledge, Max and Dom
[SPEAKER_00]: are the guys you wanna go see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can't really see this,
but off camera, I am dunking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my little isopropanol vial
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my banger basket yet from
Mike LaGroux, but I am awaiting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a quick, clean, full dunk of
the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest, I haven't tried it yet
with DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will for certain do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just no way to clean these
turpslerpers with Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit them enough, little bits of
resin end up getting locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locked away and it just won't stay new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are so valuable and so precious
to me that I am just down with taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: utmost delicate care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I don't think there's
much else to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna get these pizzas in the freezer,
maybe one in the toaster oven and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: well they taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything I've seen, they look and
taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, may the full male bless your bowl
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go cook a pizza and let you know how
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man calls us royal, alongside the man
called Richie Spock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, waterfalls from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Na na na na na na na na na na na.
