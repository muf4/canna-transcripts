[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got flat 421 in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the Buck Marcel Angler.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the timer out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, good call.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, this pipe is so ridiculous,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be hitting dabs out of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never actually done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only smoked bowls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I was thinking about
selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shocked and dismayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little carb capo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool with the bright sky behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Angler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to heat it up more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it cool too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some nice low temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing hits so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a jet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
Shit!
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well this is an exciting moment
on my deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hitting the Marcel Buck Angler from
flat 421 who's on the camera right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've only ever hit bowls of hash with
a beeline in this out of the Marcel Push
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I've put a banger
on it so we're going to heat this up and
[SPEAKER_03]: have a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I love the weight of this piece in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: The size of the can and the way it feels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, sitting up against my
shoulder right now, as well as right on my
[SPEAKER_03]: body, I can feel three points of contact
with this pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, three points of contact for a
pipe like this is definitely what you
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say, Flav?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I think you're probably okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like hitting a little double can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like saying hi to an old friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how special is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun's beating down, the ocean's blue,
and I'm puffing the Buck Marcel Angler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks, Flav.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got such a beautiful squish out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a tiny bit more left in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull it open a bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the beautiful drip and butter that
we got out of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It crystallized right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color's just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to macro-photograph it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
