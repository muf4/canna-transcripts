[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I just wanted to give a shout out to
my good friend Mr. Robert Connell Clark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also wanted to thank Mr. Mark D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both Rob and Mark sent me a copy of the
brand new Cannabis Evolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a book that these guys have
been working on for approximately 17
[SPEAKER_00]: years, if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unbelievable amount of content in
this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduction to the multi-purposes plant
Cannabis is chapter 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move into Natural Origins and Early
Evolution of Cannabis, chapter 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 3 is the Ethnobotanical Origins,
Early Cultivation and Evolution through
[SPEAKER_00]: Human Selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we move into, and that's a very
huge chapter, a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 4, the Cultural Diffusion of
Cannabis, also a very big chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 5, History of Cannabis Use for
Fiber, chapter 6, Food, Feed, and Oil Use
[SPEAKER_00]: of Hemp, chapter 7, Historical Aspects of
Psychoactive Cannabis Use for Ritual and
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreation, chapter 8, Ethnobotanical
History and Contemporary Context of
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Cannabis, chapter 9,
Non-Psychoactive Ritual Uses of Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter 10, Recent History of Cannabis
Breeding, 11, Classical and Molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxonomy of Cannabis, getting into the
science, and 12, the Hypotheses Concerning
[SPEAKER_00]: the Early Evolution of Cannabis,
now there is a final one as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, which is Homo sapiens, Cannabis and
Homo sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the book that they are kind of
rocking the boat with that is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the NLDs and the WLDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a narrow leaf drug cultivar
and a wide leaf drug cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of which he's stating are from the
indica family and that the sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than an actual species,
is more like a useful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hemp of the species, and he's
saying indica branched out and created a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide leaf and a narrow leaf drug cultivar
for obviously recreational and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: use, and that's covered in this book,
so if you don't have one already,
[SPEAKER_00]: go check it out on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool that both Rob and Mark signed
this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, thanks for the great photos,
and Mark D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlin, so yeah, I guess I've got a few
photos in this here book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure to share photos with the
likes of Rob Clark for one of his books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as a historical context that I'll
be able to look at one back, look back in
[SPEAKER_00]: time and see, you know, to be a part of a
book like this, a book that is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a university textbook in my
opinion, and if you haven't seen Rob speak
[SPEAKER_00]: before, get onto Bubbleman's World,
look up Cannabis Cup episode 11 I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob does a beautiful speech, he went right
on before Tony and myself, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: catch our talk as well, but I just wanted
to thank both Mark and Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for doing what you do,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cannabis historians, you're
cannabis scholars, and we need more guys
[SPEAKER_00]: like you in our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a very important job, and I want to
urge all of you guys out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you haven't picked up Marijuana Botany,
wow, then you're way behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up Hashish after that,
and once you've read those two thoroughly
[SPEAKER_00]: several times from front cover to back
cover, you can pick up the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution and Ethnobotany, so now this is
going to be really for those guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to geek out harder than your average
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very university textbook like,
there's a lot of information, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: well documented, and yeah, there's the
boys right there, Rob and Mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: so go give them some support, and thanks
for watching Bubbleman's World,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't want to let me turn it off,
I guess I'm supposed to share a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we've got the Atomical Haze
that was given to me by the Kind Selection
[SPEAKER_00]: Group, a good buddy, Tim, it's been
outside for its entire flowering cycle the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of weeks, and it's gotten a
little bit cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tips are turning a little
bit reddish, and just what an unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: view for this plant to spend out the
latter part of its life, so thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone for sharing, sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time on Bubbleman's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
