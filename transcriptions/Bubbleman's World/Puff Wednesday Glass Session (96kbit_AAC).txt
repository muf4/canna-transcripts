[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and I want to welcome my two guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Golden Bear Hettys on Instagram if
you want to check him out and Wins West
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was with these guys the other day
for Hash Church and we kind of had all
[SPEAKER_01]: this epic glass together and had this
feeling like we wanted to have a session
[SPEAKER_01]: but really the session was Hash Church,
the focus was Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we've decided that 420 Session is
in session and it's going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have come down from Whistler
and we're here right on the beautiful Howe
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound and we've got what I would call a
pretty damn epic lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty stacked up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: By anyone's standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got on the far left here your
Lookers Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Swiss Perk which is a gift
from Nate Dizzle years ago when I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland with him and we drove down to
Germany along with Steve Hopps to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys did some collaborations with
Martin from Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to that we've got a prototype Fab Egg
from Scott Deppie's company The Mothership
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'll let you explain your piece,
throw it in line there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a Marceau Dale Somers collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some big thick flat cane on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of Marceau's readies on the base and
in the center and on the disc mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marceau actually explained a little bit
about this piece if you guys want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the history on the last episode of
Hash Church episode 29.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he comes in around 18 or 19 minute
mark and he starts talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next in line after that is another
clear proto from Mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one being the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Deppie's design on the Recycler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a DC glass banger and then next
in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next in line is an Aaron Colbert Dutch
Pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron just started working on these
designs this year and he's been killing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the colorway is Lemon Drop over
Pomegranate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the guy after that is Mothership
Elite Ball Rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color is Equinox.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy after that is an AK Absolute Crunk
Recruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a Blue Stardust little Staclo
Recycler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that you got a Dosa part of
the Mothership and it's his little tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his Rainbow Ready over the Crushed
Opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really thick because of the layering
of the Crush on the Opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uranium so under black light it glows
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those sleepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really know what it does until
you actually put that light onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that you got a Slop Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a collab between Zac P and
Slop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice little ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beside that is a little Snick.
[SPEAKER_01]: His new line is the Trill Jammers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what he's calling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Double Cup Purple with Slime and
Peach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little pocket rig kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally to finish it off we've
got the Straight Fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pretty big beast of a Straight Fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not making these any longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The holes, the perk holes are put in
really low which I really like about this
[SPEAKER_01]: piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really adds to the chug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a Cory Cottenham drop down that
was a gift from Flav.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the new Silicon Carbide Hybrid
Titanium Nail plugged into the Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the D-Nail on this side
plugged into the Mothership with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pooking Bee Quartz Bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we didn't mention that this
Dutch Pump is rocking a Double XL Banger
[SPEAKER_01]: from DC Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to hit that one today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe towards the end we'll just
drop some huge rip that we can all drop a
[SPEAKER_01]: ribbon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really like a guy to take a 2 gram
rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll definitely share a big giant
Double XL rip with you guys, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we also put a little bit of
treats out on the table here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've obviously got our beautifully
cleaned water with some ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've also got some organic
strawberries and some bread with some oil
[SPEAKER_01]: and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it would be a good kind of way
to cleanse our palate between some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rips that we're taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys went and did yourselves
over here, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of work the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a fat slab of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fat slab of rosin you don't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another fat slab other than the one we had
on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's definitely got to be
qualifiable as a fat slab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's drip it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: A forearm even.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you guys post a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is quite something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a new appreciation knowing for
100% sure that there's no solvent or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor profile is unlike any oil
I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally pretty unique, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got some Horatio Delbert,
his latest limonene distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's literally, I don't know if it was
like a rosin type process, but basically
[SPEAKER_01]: he cleaned up his LHO to a new level and
this is very, very, very new and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably take a couple of dabs of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is decarboxylated fully 100%
activated before you heat it up and take a
[SPEAKER_01]: rip so you can rub it on your skin,
you can consume it orally, or you can dab
[SPEAKER_01]: it, which is to me, that's that rah-rah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real medicine right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course we've got a little bit
of D420K Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be hitting some dabs, some dumps of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the hash, the rosin and the
oil, I think we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of where do we begin,
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you pick if you had your pick,
because you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be an interesting thing
without any sort of, what piece are you...
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we start at one end of the table,
or do we just start picking off?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could literally start anywhere you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind starting in the middle
because the middle puts me right around
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start in the mini section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, literally, these two are both the
sixth piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both meet right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I should do is hit them both
simultaneously, out of each nostril.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what you do with elites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on people flipping rigs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, does it hurt my heart?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did someone just want to like,
hey, we should infuse some massive
[SPEAKER_01]: stupidity into a really kind of cool
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough to say, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds cool, like my ships do flips,
and the idea of flipping a piece before
[SPEAKER_01]: you take a rip is cool, but the idea of
losing potentially that piece breaks my
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I must just be too old, because I
can't even wrap my head around it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guy posted in the mothership group
today, and he had flipped a piece and then
[SPEAKER_01]: took the rip, and I was like, it had one
of these on it, and I was literally like,
[SPEAKER_01]: did he just put that on afterwards,
or did he flip it with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched the video again,
and I was like, he flipped it with that...
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably nicely resined in there
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people put buckets in after they
flip it, and then I've seen people flip it
[SPEAKER_01]: with buckets in, and it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people flipping their AKs as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's just... It's hard to handle
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't imagine flipping that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well I'm thinking... I think I'm
gonna hit this little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your boy blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Equinox.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what better piece to start off with?
[SPEAKER_01]: That color pull is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen another Elite with that
color pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fusion in it is what sets it off from
any blue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an absolute champ too,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now to figure out, do I want to torch
quartz?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to hit silicon carbide?
[SPEAKER_01]: So many choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even narrowed down the rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well you know what I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only ever hit this rig with a banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what I'll do... You don't mind
quartz going indirect?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, quartz is generally pretty darn
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just bring that over this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the quartz because it doesn't get
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a little wipe of this just
for cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make sure nothing goes into the
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will clean my quartz before I put
it into your Elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just made a lovely sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what do I hit?
What do I hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I hit Horatio's oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I hit the... I think I hit the rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's a giant fucking tub of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks so sweet with the little nail
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be incredible is if you could
get a quartz bowl with this color pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the perfect distance away to
not be too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's border but it's like... You just got
to watch your hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to pick a piece as well,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we can hit multiples at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if one of you have an interest on
hitting this with the nail on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pass it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask for that next,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well because that's actually a
real nice hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the electric nail on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going for the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the straight fab I have set up right
now, it's sort of in an experimental phase
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sense that... Oh, I know what it's
doing, what we're doing wrong actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you're going to get a super low temp
hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it might not necessarily be
wrong, but I'll tell you this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: head that I have on here, you see how it's
big?
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits a 20 millimeter...
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got the flat coil on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the flat coil on because the
other one I have, the silicone carbide,
[SPEAKER_01]: is just the head and this middle piece
isn't in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could potentially try that out
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that is some strong rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a treat to be in presence of such
beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: With great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great solvent-free oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite an experience going over to
Horatio's the other day and getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: play around in his lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are hard on him in the
sense that he's not sharing his concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: and his ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he feels very responsible that he
doesn't want to share anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: generally going to be dangerous to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You share something the wrong way and then
all of a sudden that can be... It can have
[SPEAKER_01]: a bad outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really put his energy and time into
making sure that everything is 100% safe
[SPEAKER_01]: and efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he said, if you don't have any
knowledge in chemistry or degree in
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry, the process might not be on the
level that you're extracting that or that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're proficient at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting it out strong with the mini ball
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a pretty sweet looking little
unit you got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unique and so different in their
functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how we have the pillars
on either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Swiss perk, which I mean I don't know
if it had, it did, but it must have
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I said before we started all
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first had the Fab Egg and the
Straight 5 described to me without seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: them, I had them described to me as a 360
degree Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first saw the Swiss perk,
I have to say I was somewhat like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ooh, I don't know if I can
really deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it looked so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was smoking it out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This piece was my daily driver for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to the point where I took it camping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That piece has been punted into the bushes
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the pitch black, people getting up
by the fire and just being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's so thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super thick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a real sort of well used piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always got a shout out Nate Dizzle for
the gift because it blew me away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it blowing Soma away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him being like, he's like, why do the hits
taste better out of that pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I sold Soma like the Jason Lee
double and triple bubbler marble slingers
[SPEAKER_01]: back in 01, 02, 03.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma's always been on the ball with the
newest, greatest, greatest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: More for function than art.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really more into just the
functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't believe how much the Swiss
perk made the hit taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Functionality all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Function over fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can get fashion with your
function, that's what kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there you go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make this more accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought extra water for when ours gets
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top it up there, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piece of bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of cannabis tapas,
just having nice things out on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make the sesh that much nicer,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often the only thing that really ends
a session for me is becoming too hungry or
[SPEAKER_01]: too thirsty to want to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta fill that hunger gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna torch this guy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what fills the hunger gap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Better than bread and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite of my AKs right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the nice booty to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice fat ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shaping of these older ones is
definitely one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torch works quick,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna just do a dump of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with a little dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a proper crowd cap for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, do we have OFZ?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see one on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that right there in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I didn't pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in my case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of times do you guys like to
leave your courts for, say, in regards to
[SPEAKER_01]: oil versus hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin being oil, the LHO being oil,
anything else oil-wise that you hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my timer that I use that Dab.Ninja
hooked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a... I typically go for... He's on
his phone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just pulling my timer to set it up
for the best flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a funny conversation off camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically hit about 42 to 45 seconds for
all my oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to not dab hashes, other than
rosin, I guess, on quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any full melt I dab with an enail,
with a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so good, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coughing and exhaling the
awesomeness of that rep while you were
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend not to hit dab hashes on quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you should try... That was a
really nice little rip out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll give it a whirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is, in a sense, from an oil
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to have that pain in the
ass of being like, fuck, that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: char left over, compared to the clean oils
that leave nothing, you're always going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that left over with trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever that membrane, whatever that is
that you're maintaining in the screen when
[SPEAKER_01]: you press rosin, that ends up on the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there right now, and it's just a
matter of torching it for a few seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few seconds extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to try some of that
D420K?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab it up, dab it up, do whatever you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to press it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have also the invitation to go see Flav
later on, so we may potentially continue
[SPEAKER_01]: this session for a bit here and hopefully
instill some positive conversation that
[SPEAKER_01]: can somewhat lead people to learning and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Bubble Man's world is all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, a real appreciation
for a part of the community that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: directly from the smoking aspect,
which often people, you know, they'll say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, your channel would be more educational
if you weren't just sitting around smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: like teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remind people that the
smoking aspect of cannabis is how a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: us came to learn a lot of what we know
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the passion and then literally like
you start seeking it out, like why did we,
[SPEAKER_01]: why did Jack Herrera compile his book?
[SPEAKER_01]: What led him to, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's this fire within people that
seems to be ignited through the smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: and the intake, even orally of cannabis,
that creates a love for it, creates this
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, you know, and this is one aspect
of that love and what an incredible aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Marcel was saying that the Heddy's
Hall, it's not really about the piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's about the story of how the piece
came to be and what it's gone through and
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's how you can sit down and talk
about different pieces and different
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques that the artists do and
function and fashion of the pieces and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole business end of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even the pieces themselves are,
they're unique constructs of fractioned
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of learning that are shared
through specific groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy learned, I mean, for instance,
Jason Lee learned the double bubbler can,
[SPEAKER_01]: that second can weld.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big deal when he just shared
that with Slinger and a host of other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden that was at the forefront
and that's what everyone was selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jason could have tried to hold onto
that in a way, but he really just put it
[SPEAKER_01]: out there right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way that I bet you a lot of people
don't even know that he was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people to really produce it and then
not only that, well, I had a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with Jason back in the day
that he would send me the odd time like
[SPEAKER_01]: prototype pieces, like I probably got six
or seven of them over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of clear or sometimes somewhat worked
prototype pieces that were just literally
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that he was, I guess, using,
you know, the piece was really just an
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment to come up with whether that
seal works or whether it chugs properly or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether I tried this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and because he's Jason, if he was
sending it to me, that it means he liked
[SPEAKER_01]: it enough that it wasn't, you know,
one that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand that guys
like Jason, guys like Sling, Marcel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's, you know, a host of
other glassblowers going back way before
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, guys like Dan Kay, Snodgrass,
Hugh, all those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Hugh, that was my first piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like no one understands that all
these techniques, the shapings,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seals, everything evolved from
everything those guys were crushing or
[SPEAKER_01]: were crushing out back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things didn't start at mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys, you know, had to evolve to
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass had to evolve to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd bounce ideas off of each other and
see how things went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure, everybody evolved into their own
things and kind of took ideas from people
[SPEAKER_01]: and went their ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just killed it on their own levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy the Hades are coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they never really won away,
but the appreciation got lopsided,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is beautiful to see a row of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just nice, beautiful pieces.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple clear protos in there, but they got
the function too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're respectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dosa, what say ye Dosa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try a little dab of Horatio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to dab on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go for three of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll start the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Dosa is such a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of fell in love with it the first
time you showed it to me at Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you guys want to check out
the first time I've seen this piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the Whistler video with Aaron from
DNA and Matt the Great Gardener and
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav421.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Devin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Devin might have been there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to remember, but it's worth
checking out the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a good session and there's as well
a beautiful lineup of Hades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the ridiculous pipes that Flav had
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought a lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a few Doses out that night.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that go for a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's always nice to get that low
tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, this is a personal thing,
but it's pretty easy to figure out on your
[SPEAKER_01]: own level what's too hot as opposed to
what's too low, if that's possible for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed it a lot with the CBD Renée.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dabbing CBD Renée Dry Sift through
Quartz and I was just finding that at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain temperatures, it was so candied
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you went too hot, all that candy flavor
was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had CBD oil, but I noticed that
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher temperatures, super cherry-like
flavors, lower temperatures, super floral
[SPEAKER_01]: notes, and just that contrasting flavor
was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how that just completes the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super low temp and it was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people can't see the baby dabs of
this LHO that we're doing, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely tiny and they hit freight
trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowman gave me a dab a bit earlier on and
I was like, okay, we'll just take this
[SPEAKER_01]: little dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit smaller than I would
normally dab and it just rushed me and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, wow, big ups to Horatio.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: De-carved already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saying hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely feels medicine-y in the way
that it goes in and just a very strong
[SPEAKER_01]: edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it feels like right away it melts
your muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any type of any sort of discomfort that
you have just gets taken away right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the difference between making hash
in your basement as opposed to now going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the lab and producing literally a
nutraceutical to pharmaceutical level
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It even smells very, very herbal in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many nice pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to hit next?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go meet up with Flav and I'm sure
he's going to be like more heavy to the
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The table could be so ridiculously heavy,
which it kind of already is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I puff out of prototypes or
production pieces, clear glass most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the elites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're awesome and amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For whatever reason, I just haven't
focused my attention in the collecting of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav and higher end row, they have such
beautiful pieces that it almost feels like
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to just be exposed to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I wasn't... Those collections
just inspire people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those collections inspire me and for sure
they've inspired... I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the collection, but for whatever
reason... What made me get a Marcel is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely Flav's collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav's got some beautiful Marcel's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting glass has been something I've
loved for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brought me to meet some incredible
people, to have some pretty incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll pull out my Hettys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like the 99 Marcel's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the true Hettys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go into the city, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Hettys started for people
that don't really know glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my first Hettys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had a Hugh Grass and it was
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd seen Snodgrass pieces and I'd seen all
those style pieces, but it was like... And
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they were even considered Hettys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even met Jason Lee in 1998 when I
picked up Marvel Slinger Hitchhiker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason Lee was the guy that was with
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed me what he called the 420
piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what do you mean 420?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, it's 420 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like 420 US dollars for a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then that must have been so mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like this crazy beautiful piece
that he had blown this clear orb of glass
[SPEAKER_01]: around the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole top of the bowl was just clear
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had put a little hole in it and
filled it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filled it right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, oh, it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you get all the air out and
it's all full of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one little drop of air plugs the
hole so it doesn't leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any time you put a nug in the bowl,
it magnifies the bud like a picture all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way around the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, oh my god,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is fucking maybe the greatest thing
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if we do end up at my office
later looking at some of my Hettys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Chillum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's made by Jason Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole top of it is a clear glass
piece that you fill with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason he did that for me was because
when I met him he had that piece and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in 99 when Marcel came out with
the stacked sculpture piece, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend to say that he was the first
person to ever do that, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely the first time me or any of the
people I knew around everywhere I took it
[SPEAKER_01]: had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd pull that thing out of a box and
people would just be like, are you kidding
[SPEAKER_01]: me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, how much was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much was that piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, oh, like four G's,
$4,000 pipe in 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really insanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insanity, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dropped that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I'm like, I remember
meeting Marcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how can you expect someone to
pay that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: An hour and a half later I was offered him
to break it in because I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it and you're like, oh,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if I can afford it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't sleep on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, yeah,
you can't sleep on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just keeps you up at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes your palms sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects how you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to collectors, to me anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about it here on Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: The class addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting is an addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting is an addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, literally to the point where
it could bankrupt you the way going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: casino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen it on a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within range.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like about collecting is it teaches
you responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, when I try to have
the discussion with people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the community or the scene,
they're just like, well, that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy a car with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could buy that piece and sell it in
two years and make profit that could buy
[SPEAKER_01]: you two cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like playing the stock market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about collecting that I want
to say is don't buy a piece for its resell
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy the piece because you love the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I've collected what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's generally why you would want to
collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's always people that are
going to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have you had your AK for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my AK since 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't know about AK until like
what, maybe two years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the people?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough to say when, you know,
the hype started, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this piece has gone up in price like
$18,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: A ridiculous amount compared to what I
paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, like you buy for love,
you don't buy for, you don't buy for
[SPEAKER_01]: resell value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you someone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made a post about this on my
Instagram lately and it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a bunch of collectors received
it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a bunch of people who flipped glass,
you know, didn't receive it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they thought they were getting
called out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm not trying to hurt any
feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, there's a lot of art that gets
flipped and that's part of the reason why
[SPEAKER_01]: glass is so expensive these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the art world though,
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always, anything that can fetch a
price in those ranges is going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people that hone in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially because what they're feeding
on, or feeding off of, is that energy of
[SPEAKER_01]: you like wanting that piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people desiring these pieces so much
that, of course, someone's going to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: step in and profit off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with regards to what you just
said about people desiring the glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: like glass thievery has gone up in the
last bunch, which is just terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most gut-wrenching thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have way more, like that's
something that really, to me, I would call
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of pieces have come back through the
help of the community though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with a piece like that once
you've stolen a piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, what are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about a mothership getting stolen
and the person who stole it was rolling
[SPEAKER_01]: into a lounge and dabbing out of it for
the same day they stole it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, mothership groups on Facebook,
it got shared super quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody noticed it was gone and it got
brought back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing's pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super mini cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know for me, certain things get
into my collection and they don't leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what collecting is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not holding onto something for five
months and then being like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to afford something else,
I need to sell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I'm not smiting anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying there's collecting and
that's the base that I come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must come from that base too because I
have glass from 97, 98, 99 and we're now
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, 17, 18 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even that orb I showed you earlier was
from 06.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this thing is mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that thing's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've been offered so much money
over the years for that Marcel number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always just been like,
oh, you know, like Marcel actually always
[SPEAKER_01]: made sure that I don't know if he feels
this way anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the day, he definitely said,
if you ever consider selling it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it if you contacted me
before, you know, anyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for certain pieces, that's
especially like meaningful pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made some trades and some sales with
close friends and that's been one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, listen, if this ever gets sold,
I'm the person that you talk to about
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to come back to me if it goes
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's especially between
friends, between people that have respect
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's definitely something that's
good to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Marcel's the blower of the piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a historic piece in his steps of
blowing glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes total sense that if you were
going to want to move it, that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: just approach him and it goes back into
his vault, if anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and just be like, work out the,
you know, hey, I would like to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece or pieces of this stature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'll tell you, that piece was
expensive back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there was a Heady Glass Museum,
that would be a cornerstone piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I smoked it with so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another piece of history that's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shot coming up.
No,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has to be in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, someone's got to hit the exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's hit the dutchy roll in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's ridiculously huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even have anything to carve this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uncarvable, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that kind of-ish fits maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the silicone carbide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it doesn't look that big,
it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be taking a lot of
monster massive rip right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I am going to hit this giant double XL
bowl just to see how she hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be putting two grams of anything
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still daylight, so a little bit
early for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still daylight, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we really do make it into the city
and bump into Flav, because it would sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just step it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is a good fun chunk of
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at all this glass, talking about
the different aspects of their functions
[SPEAKER_01]: and the glass blowers and the community,
even from the collecting standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: because obviously these two guys are
collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a sense, I've never really thought
of myself as a collector, but as Wins here
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking, I thought, jeez, I am a
collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got a pretty good collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started kind of uniquely for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met them and they were kind of young,
up-and-coming, glass blowers, and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: loved what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like it was like a form of activism
that they chose to, you know, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: could have done any aspect of glass
blowing, but they chose to do the form of
[SPEAKER_01]: glass blowing that produced pipes for
smoking hash and constant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stories of how you met them are rather
incredible.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old fish tour system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulling a Yui just because some guy looks
like he needs a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the wrong side of the street,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulling a Yui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I think I want to pick that guy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out it's Jay Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was Slinger, but then he was with
Jay Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male version of this, uh, we can only
hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 mil coil light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it raging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it raging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could have a hobo fire on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I put this in there right now,
I think it would burst into flames.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy did that with the Dapskateball
toss.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it on the first try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a hobo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally not doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going here?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little dry sip from D420K through the
Dutch pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Aaron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super smooth coming through that thing,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I tell you, that hit like a,
like a freight train too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel his eyes dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't even look like it touched a
quarter of that bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do feel the need to want to like
scrape away the leftovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing's still raging, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably take like eight low temp,
temp it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably one thing where this thing
will come in really heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you just light it up once and then
just pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no, dude, it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone dabs in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for an hour, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll blow that out and clean it out later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's this guy over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a spaceship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Park these beasts with precision and
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't be flipping ships here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is the ship flip free zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip, ship free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm good talking and then LHO
just kind of taps you on the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, you're going to trip over
the next three words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decarb to medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has it got?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says for oral use only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the Swiss perk get ripped?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the Swiss perk's been
ripped, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Zlop's in front of me,
but I might switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could hit the Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dizzle up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit the Dutch pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit the Equinox ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit the Zlop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the Dosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the Staclo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty far down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have to hit the monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty wicked actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's bizarre yet awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can tell right off the bat by the
size of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often find these little rigs to be the
ones that will often give you that look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like, man, I almost fell off my
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one are we doing on this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just like your little pocket rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect little jammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sits by my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude's so sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now who did this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about this piece of it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snick did this?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a new thing he's been kind of
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from age this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of nice little opals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does a piece like this move for on
the open market?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just 15 hundo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be real careful with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he sits in his case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gets pulled out used and put back away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He comes through and sits by my bed for a
while and goes back in his case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like that Swiss function.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can park that for you.
It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be, uh, so maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it did drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I felt it on my hand.
Fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got to say I like this little
Snick so far in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it's just super trippy monkey face
looking at you with the smirk on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eyes are pretty, uh, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so do the marbles with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's ridiculous that giant fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny to put in a small raise to
stick your thumb right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, might as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you, the madness,
when you needed, uh, a banger that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that will go three, four dabs before
it's cooled down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to dive your whole stash at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it.
Pushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little reps always hit with ferocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen my minke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else want to hit the monkey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me another dab before you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me another dab before you do,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what?
[SPEAKER_01]: L H O?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't stop dabbing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should you stop?
Damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when I first started dabbing
oil way back, it's like that same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I just want that taste in my mouth
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never thought I'd say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably just going to continue on
doing this for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll wrap it up with the last rip here
that wins is about to take and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: we pick right back up with a simple
transition into hanging out with Flav
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has just got me all inspired to go
like order some Goldies pizza or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go, I just want to say a few
things about this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden bear headies has never had Goldies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so Aaron is a new up and coming,
always not new.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the torch since 2012,
but he's, uh, this is kind of like his
[SPEAKER_01]: breakout year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a good friend of mine,
local to Colona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, these Dutch pumps are the
shit that you get on the boat 40 seconds
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, about 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So puff Canada just had two of these and
sold them instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, uh, I'll have a few for sale
and then, uh, heavy shops around North
[SPEAKER_01]: America hit Aaron Colbert up, uh,
or me up and, uh, we'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Aaron Colbert, Dutch disc,
Dutch pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swiss perk into fab bag into Marcel old
school into Taurus, into ball rig,
[SPEAKER_01]: AK, Zlopp, Dosa, Staclo and that little
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snake and of course the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different cool functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is really cool that you can get
in touch with so many of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: artists directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the great things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know most artists aren't able to
deal with all of that aspect of the
[SPEAKER_01]: business and they just pass it on to
different people and businesses that they
[SPEAKER_01]: do business with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's neat for the collector to be able
to have that chance to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_01]: the artist and acquire glass directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right guys, we're going to see you
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching Bob man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all the tall pipes and he's just
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like my Marcell's wearing a hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, you guys want to hit some dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just that off camera voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We of course are not downtown Vancouver,
but we did go outside and get some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sick pictures of the glass lined up
outside on the top of the banister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably enough to give, you know,
a normal person a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were hanging out there a little bit
stack of G's on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even went off and ate while they just
sat over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a little barbecue action there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're well famished and we thought,
you know what, rather than leave you
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging and just end the video,
we thought, let's go back and have another
[SPEAKER_01]: mad session and hit a bunch of that Ross
and that dry sift and that LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you say gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say old boy, I think I might start with
this little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was quite fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Head it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean all of it in the double XL.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drop as much as it really does,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, holy moly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so tacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did vary temperatures a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one side is slightly tackier and one
slide is slightly more like shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: almost, but it's all tasty as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely have to rip it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: My reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a reach man, but I really need this
effing dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw me that tool in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at you guys going for the,
right as I'm about to light the torch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three stooges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily we're not the three stooges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't hit this guy yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you better hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I hit that yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to hit, I mean, I'm mostly
hitting the pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have access to and I definitely
want to hit that Marcel, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit all of these again real quick here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoop torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the size of the dab he's taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking like a little tiny baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really wanted to rip this.
Booyah!
[SPEAKER_01]: Teamwork makes the dream work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very small, but it was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, stack load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here, you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been dropping the stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a tiny little bit of LHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just enough to get the dabber sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little bit of a dip in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small dip in.
That'll do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stack loads were really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did well with getting this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, give me a dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you order ten of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you wished you got a dozen,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, okay, I got like 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had people lined up for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept them all local though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I pretty much try to keep them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are all in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them went out to the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed the boat on it, but I would have
grabbed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I first saw it,
I was like, dude, I grabbed one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shape him, function, size, color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was really nice about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't flip ships, but we definitely
flip Marcel's.
[SPEAKER_01]: You flip it to me, and I'll flip it to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a nice piece, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a solid piece of glass right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice tabletop piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the ribbons of Dicro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The varieties are off the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's air trapping us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the ridiculousness,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that slide is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LHO dry sift combo was maybe the
strongest hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hit since we've been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to do a rosin LHO dry sift
rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a session, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Started out as a 420 session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is now potentially 720.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff hard Wednesday session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a puff hard Wednesday session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been asking for a puff
Wednesday, and in reality this was a puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Nate Dissel's last handspun videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he got a lathe after Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the game plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess these guys, does Mothership
also have some pretty incredible high
[SPEAKER_01]: precision tools that are kind of like
their must?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few people have mentioned that they have
access to these really high precision
[SPEAKER_01]: tools, which right off the bat shows why
they would.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of why Ruhr stood out back in
the day, just because it was 100,000 euro
[SPEAKER_01]: lathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very expensive lathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost like a level of precision
that is not going to be exhibited in most
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes that are blown.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin from Ruhr will be coming out here
in the next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to having a visit
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been waiting to see him out here for oh,
15 plus years, maybe almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been friends a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always had a relationship with Ruhr,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of my first, I used to hit
their pieces a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I still do have my Ruhr
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to hit them a lot before glass
turned into what it turned into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's so many aspects of it I find
that it's hard to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God I know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so safe with the banger on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally hit it with a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: This piece could also hold the XXL banger
well, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would look more appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one looks a little kind of like
shrunken head style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, that's not even it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, hey, I don't even have to try
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like way bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's hot, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just torched it up pretty good from all
angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quartz well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does tend to hold that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly how that's going to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big whole thumb in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a big person can fit that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that amount of surface
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that there could be some,
there's still so many unknown factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know what they like and they're
convinced of what they like through
[SPEAKER_01]: different discoveries of temperature and
low temp and higher temp and this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're all experiencing them through
different variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, at this point, it hasn't really
been like, in my opinion, properly
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the point where, you know, wouldn't it
be cool to just have a list?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh yeah, like for quartz,
these are the temperatures and these are
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, like a proper explanation
of like, well, I noticed the taste change
[SPEAKER_01]: from candy to more of a spicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the enid comes in though,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dial it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the names of the terpenes and
knowing when those terpenes, like which
[SPEAKER_01]: ones are the most volatile, meaning which
ones do you taste first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw someone put up a list on Instagram a
couple weeks ago and it had a list of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and their temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, hey, just so everyone
can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's good information out there
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't seem to be available
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would sure like to see it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even right now, I'm sure people will
go and search for that picture that you
[SPEAKER_01]: saw on Instagram and they'll be like,
a toast sandwich?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not a toast sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your head at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldens all bared out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldens all bared out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I just hit last?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the Stacla.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, did you hit the 12 year one?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I hit another one right after
that though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was the Stacla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I took the banger out of the
Stacla.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the Marsau.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last hit really was quite wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should try a triple threat.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple threat number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your triple threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put too much of this stuff
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely the one that, well,
they all, the combination, the synergy of
[SPEAKER_01]: the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's serious, a cannabinoid profile
Stacla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stacking right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't flip ships, but we do stack
profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that for a t-shirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to bring my water outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think when we were eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to fill up?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then I'm drinking the rest out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice glass of water while puffing dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the first rosin dab I did just
gripped me too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one takes a hold of you too,
trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, where am I going to hit it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did you dip it in dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to hit it out of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's Marsau sitting right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did go very nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know because I'm hitting it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to hit nice glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even nicer to hit a bunch of nice
glass in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back to my one weekly piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just visiting out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, living in Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I came to know Aaron Colbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living in Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just moved out here from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the first dudes that was
super welcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm in Kelowna every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit you guys up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come by the studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend owns a winery just in West Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty close to the bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right behind the gas station actually
on the way down to the bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that little gas station off to the
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just right above there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to breed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's playing around with grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty cool for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: K-Town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has he ever thought about coming back now
that there's so much money?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he just came back out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow him at Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: One word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's well involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's grapefruit and sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's spice of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spice of life seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple threat.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that six comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was kind of spaced out for about a
minute or two after I took that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Oliver is going to be like,
wow, he's just spaced out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am spaced out to a degree, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the whole thing all lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what I own, but that's my favorite
piece maybe in the theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I love what I own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard not to love Marcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really not only pioneered a big chunk
