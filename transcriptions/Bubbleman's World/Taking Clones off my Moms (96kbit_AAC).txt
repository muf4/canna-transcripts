[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome on this fresh Sunday after
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church to my little grow that I got
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got my three little plants going
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you the healthiest of the three
is the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've given it one little pinch so
far since Johnny B brought it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in darn near perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believed when I first got it and then I
noticed the tiniest tiniest little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew, which I clipped off and I
gave the plants a little bit of a hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxide soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this one is the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow nice and stocky and nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then all finally, I guess I'll show you
the Barb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's the smallest of the three,
but she's catching up and just started to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't pinched her yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed the other two, the minute I
pinched them, the growth on them was
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan leaves widened up and everything
got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it really over the last
just two nights did some, some excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I am doing right now is I had some
devastation to my moms while I was away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did manage to keep a lot of them alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm going to do today is I'm
going to be cloning those moms,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the healthy revenge to plant matter
that I've been able to grow back after
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of bugs basically and extreme
dehydration brought them back to a good
[SPEAKER_01]: enough on the tips to get some decent
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted to do is kind of take
you guys through my botanic hair cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through it one time before,
but I figured, you know what, I'll show
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People seem to like this on bubble man's
world and I don't show enough about my
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd show this up and it's
real straightforward and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 48 plant botanic hair unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got about a five gallon reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a small little pump, a utility
pump in the bottom here that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: aerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've also got a aeration stone
that's all been hooked up and lined up and
[SPEAKER_01]: plugged in and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used the botanic hair products that they
sent me, which is Aqua shield,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've broken down and they've got the
total nitrogen at point zero two percent
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia called nitrogen and available
phosphates and soluble pot hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the breakdown there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also use power clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, you know, basically a product
I'm not even too sure of potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrates, ammonium nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a liquid advanced liquid
formula for rapid robust roots from
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not promoting it over anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying it's what I have on hand
and it's what I'm going to give a shot to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It very well may not even be a hundred
percent organic as I read the nitrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're just for my clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last time I used both these
products, it worked incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use them in a lower amounts than what
they ask for on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottle suggests using 15 mls of
this particular one per four liters of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one suggests a forty five to
sixty five mls per into one per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also four gallons, four liters of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did about half to a third of those
numbers and I've got it all right here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm basically just going to take this
guy sitting over here gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to bring this water level up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's still the pump is
completely covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably use maybe another half gallon or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have that pH to six point three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my pH pen right here,
a blue lab pH pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important when you're doing
anything with cannabis and feeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and seedlings that you just keep in
mind that the water, the pH of the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural pH of the water, that comes
out of many people's taps is very high,
[SPEAKER_01]: upwards of seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put in organic, synthetic or
organic nitrates like manures,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to bring the pH way down,
down sometimes to two, three and four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to A, have a pH meter so
you can read your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course it's important to
usually have like a pH up, which is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to get your levels up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use pH down because I just use
food and my food brings the pH down from
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I bring it back up with the pH
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got those two guys in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's aerating very nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put a little bit more water
in here and we will get to the next step,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will, I'll be bringing up the clones
to show how quick and easy we can just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mark them down, the names of
them and get them each into a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do that next.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're back with a little bit more water
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get that level up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have a covering the entire
pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make sure that the levels are
up high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's basically that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the top down here all cleaned up
to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to go downstairs and we're going to grab
[SPEAKER_01]: those clones and I'm going to show you
another preventative means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, these clones are still
growing on sickly plants that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out of health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've trimmed down much of the sickness in
order to get rid of any types of bugs that
[SPEAKER_01]: are around and anything that might still
be on there as far as an egg will be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting dipped before it goes into the
cloner and I'll be also giving them minor
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays with the clone be gone or sorry,
bug be gone that I've got as a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is much like a soapy mixture that
breaks down the outer layer of the bug and
[SPEAKER_01]: it passes away due to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I guess we'll head on down and
grab those clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right guys, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now down in the garage with some of
the hurting plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that was actually very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I wish I could show it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one actually just started producing
resin in its stress when it was not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting water and it was, it was all
bugged out, which I'm quite amazed that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't even see bug eggs or any activity of
bugs, but I guess I have been trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with them for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a Northern light from Dr.
Atomic and I guess we're going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: few cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've done is I've managed to take a
little bit of these sticky tacks and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: take a variety of these, put them all
around this and tape them up so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just write on there NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this sort of thing, making sure that
you do not assume that you can remember
[SPEAKER_01]: because trust me, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote NL dock on that one and we'll
start cutting some cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice double right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nice single right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: One NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this little guy down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very short, but make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get another one that's even longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many NLs do we really need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we need a nice fifth one and
I think I see him right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get these, sorry, fourth one,
not fifth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get these wrapped and tapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wrap those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick the tape on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we've got our little bundle of
Northern lights clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk got cut way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because I just had to get rid of a
lot of her material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's, she's hurting boys, but that's
okay because we're going to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we take care of business and we bring her
right back to the healthiest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of sweet skunk cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: One right there.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking these like it just don't matter
because it just don't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may very well get rid of these plants
after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, and one, two,
three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, I might grow them out and pass
them on to well-deserving people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what, uh, I guess two,
it's not a bad idea to strip them and
[SPEAKER_01]: strip them right down to the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make it easier to do the
clones anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in an easy position right now for
stripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four sweet skunk cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our sweet skunk cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Northern lights,
the sweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medi Kush was very, very, very,
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fed it some Medi one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it a couple of days of bug rehab,
a couple of cures of the bug, bug be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, man, the Medi Kush is a
strong plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, uh, it really came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very small clones on here,
but I'm going to attempt to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to attempt to at least get one,
which is going to be this big,
[SPEAKER_01]: long one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, uh, see what that does for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take this long guy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go with one Medi Kush
because the plant is so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John's already promised me to bring me
a nice healthy one, but this, this is more
[SPEAKER_01]: just a thing where you have to know that
you can bring your, your babies back when
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been, uh, when they've been
assaulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my plants literally got assaulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this last trip, they really took a
beating.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk, Medi Kush, Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mom I got from Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that we,
we keep her alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a few of these and see what we got
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the clone of the Astro Boy smells
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take the two of the Astro Boy,
two healthiest clones off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take one Ortega, which was in
full bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the most hurting and they're
fully bloomed out and man, do they smell
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to make sure these make it
into the cloner as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's some sticky icky right there.
Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: That juice all over my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just greased out, greased out
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two Ortegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be the easiest to discover
because, well, because they're in full
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little tray of clones, four,
one, two, four, and two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring these up to the cloner, get them
labeled, get them put in, turn the cloner
[SPEAKER_01]: on and that'll be the end of this video
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more thing we're going to do before
we get right to putting the clones in is
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is safer soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Omri listed as organic materials
for the review Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the product right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically just a variety of
soaps, a mix of different soaps that
[SPEAKER_01]: attack aphid buds, mealy bugs,
spider mites, whitely soft brown,
[SPEAKER_01]: fissilids, rose or pear slugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole variety of these bugs are attacked
through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I normally do is I mix 10 MLs per
500 MLs of water and I spray it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've got such small clones,
it makes sense that we dip them and we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that 100% of anything, whether it's
an agribug, if it still exists on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, on these plants, it's going to be
exposed to this soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs are broken down even faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs broken down a little slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a thousand MLs of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through a thousand MLs of water into the,
into the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we just need to drop two 10 mils.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 15 ML.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put in 15 and then a light five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give that a good stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to put on this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've gone and cleaned this whole thing
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got bleached the whole nine yards from
the last time I had anything in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cleaned everything to what I would
consider a very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one extra little guy right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll get the clones
and I'll bring them over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go in, actually before I do
that, we'll make sure that we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did this last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I have any tape nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can lay them down for now though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start with sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, another thing that I really
liked about the botanic care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really easy to label the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start with sweet skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just put that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our first row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why don't we just get right to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to papa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I even brought the
scissors back up because those will also
[SPEAKER_01]: come in handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to cut down the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, I like to cut them down,
especially when they're bigger leaves on a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the excess, so I will dump these into
the soapy mixture and I will dump them all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way up to the stock, the whole stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want them to just leap and get
this guy into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one, one little sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once she builds her strength, I did just
give them a little bit of a major soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to cut, we cut some of
these down, get rid of some of these big
[SPEAKER_01]: fan leaves that are, that are looping
this, making it dip all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a lot of those out,
dip it all the way down to the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go right into the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunks are hardy little plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grow healthy from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they're a little bit droopy from
the, from the excessive amount of soap
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm putting on, on them, but I'm
taking no chances whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm making sure that these things are
properly rooted without any bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we take these precautions,
particularly when they just had bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe a month ago or three weeks
ago, probably, well, even two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sweet skunk in the, in the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: These will be exciting to see these guys
start to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, always nice to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one last sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cut that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that big guy and that big guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut these leaves down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already super floppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to get even more floppy
when I dip them in this soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a beating of their, of their
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty violent on this bug taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why we're going to bring it
right down to the base because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hold it up and allow it to stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see how easy that is with the
cloner?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally just stripping the clones
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not requiring any rooting gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's inside the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can start doing right away,
which I haven't done yet is plug in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts shooting up the mist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make some noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear that sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a sound that you want to make
sure that you always have on when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: playing around with your corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you want to lift this up and you
don't want the water to be spraying all
[SPEAKER_01]: over, what's going to inevitably happen is
you're going to go over to the plug and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to unplug the unit and you're
going to do your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I implore you, do not forget to plug
that thing back in because it's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in the ass if you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will die fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start limping and not doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what we've got next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go for NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doc Atomic, of course, if you guys have
been watching Bubble Man's World
[SPEAKER_01]: Tournament at the time, you may have seen
Doc Atomic come by and drop off his
[SPEAKER_01]: infamous Northern Light strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, were we happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole community, of course,
because we share our strains with all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really was a wonderful thing
that he did for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that many Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we don't get any of these mixed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the NLs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nice fat little clones,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth sites are so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we'll cut that guy down to a
reasonable size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way, the whole stalk and plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, throw him into the little cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to get him standing up nice and
straight for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have a good inch plus to two
inches of stalk on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure your stalk's down
low, really in the midst of all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: water and the mixture that's blowing
around down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be key factor in your
clones cloning out nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we just cleaned the bottom
of this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got sites growing every quarter of an
inch, which is one more reason why we just
[SPEAKER_01]: love this dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really impressive little cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut, cut, cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost want to give it that little
blow just so it can release all of its
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves from being stuck together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see that, it just feels like this
shouldn't be like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these ones are a little shorter than I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're barely an inch, but they will
still grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will still root.
[SPEAKER_01]: These rooting botanic hair and the units
much like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're really all very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I've seen that one unit is
doing it so much better than the others,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these things really make cloning easy,
particularly sometimes for people that
[SPEAKER_01]: find it really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try an arrow corner for the first
time, and as long as you listen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: simple mathematics, the simple recipe,
which is make sure you have the right pH
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure you don't under water or
over water, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: These simple things, you follow them and
you can't believe the great success that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have and how beautiful the cuts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no doubt that these cuts right
here that we're cutting right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're loading into the trimmer,
into the cloner, are going to be of the
[SPEAKER_01]: utmost quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have no doubt of it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the interesting thing about
all this, and I should tell this part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the story, is that the moral of this story
is that I really just want to show myself
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone that I'm able to bring these
plants back to life that were near killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be able to do that,
but the bottom line is I'm not forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that because what I did in the
beginning, which was smarter, was I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: these clones away to a variety of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 15 to 20 different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the times I shared them
was on camera with Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from Remo and D420, and Johnny B,
and True, a genetics Phil, and a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of many other people from Flav421,
and many, many other people I have shared
[SPEAKER_01]: these strains with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why right now as I speak,
as I'm cutting these and keeping these
[SPEAKER_01]: alive, I have my friends that have already
cut clones for me on all the varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that I lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've already got them in the middle
of getting rooted, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give them and bring them to me as gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one or two plants, that's all I
require.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get one or two back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B's already hooked me up with Astro
Boy, Afghani, and Barbara Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is how it goes when you do
it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you share your genetics, you're going
to be a lot happier in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly if you happen to lose a
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never lose a strain when you share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You share that genetic, and it's not going
to be lost to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to maintain it
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we've got two Astro Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small little cuts, so we'll cut them
down as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most important part, make sure that
they're... I mean, honestly, this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: a good idea to do anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why wouldn't you want to prevent
bugs on all levels from your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't have them, this is a
great preventative, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting cuts from different people and you
don't know, you know, if you can trust the
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts that you're getting, they might seem
like they're great one day, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: next day you might just have this huge
influx of bugs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to be able to set up a
proper quarantine for yourself so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can receive plants, even that have bugs,
but then make sure that you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: something about it to the point where you
can quarantine the plants, keep them away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the rest of your garden, and make
sure you get rid of those bugs often.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I look at it is, never
underestimate these little bastards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will never stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to not underestimate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to fight them aggressively,
and if you do that, products like Bug Be
[SPEAKER_01]: Gone, Safer's, these organic products can
be used without worry, and if you don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you get yourself in a situation
where things are such a mess, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're in a situation that you're
going to be forced to try, to have to use
[SPEAKER_01]: some terrible chemical substance that I
would just personally rather start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spray deadly chemicals all
over my plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this is a Medi Kush,
the one Medi Kush that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a nice,
healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though John has offered to bring it
back, I love the idea of keeping it alive
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last but not least, we've got the big
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got these Ortegas, and these are
going to need to be cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a lot of bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally, I'd say this thing is
like easily three or four weeks into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, which is, I mean, that's pretty
big into flower for a cut, and so I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure this one gets soaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure there's no bugs hiding
out in this particular cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it all soapy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put him in the far end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: One Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean these the best that I can,
removing any leaves that have the
[SPEAKER_01]: discoloration or burnt tips on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pull those out from the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is for sure going to re-veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a miracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really that difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is just time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends up being one of those things where
if you take a clone like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: please don't anticipate that it's going to
be ready with the rest of your clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be the runt.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are more just an experiment for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that true genetics Phil would
give me this Ortega back if I asked for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but when someone gives you a clone,
do your best to keep that thing alive
[SPEAKER_01]: before you just go back and ask them for
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the least that you can do when
someone has shared such a special thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A roll of sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A roll of Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: A roll of Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One single Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right at the far end we have the Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ortega blooming right out under 18
hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how she reacts to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I normally do is actually I would
spray the Ortega at the inside of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my little half gallon sprayer
here that I'll pour a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we can do this ghetto fashion way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No funnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just catching a little bit of spill in the
bottom.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take that and pour it right back
into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us the perfect amount of
moisture that's on the inside of this lid
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will crack that baby on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always like to check immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I open these three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately water's coming out so I know
it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give these guys a little bit of a
moisture on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much because they've got that soap
on there and I don't want to wash it all
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll literally put the top on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got our clones ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's working perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you guys for watching
this little segment of Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it didn't show that many plants but
there's got to be something that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is as simple as it gets if you're
using a power cloner or a botanic hair or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of these type of cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World
and why don't we finish it off with a bon
[SPEAKER_01]: rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bon repa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll hit the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really enjoying it a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can't get that camera to come
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a bad little workout getting those
clones cut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to tell you the way it feels
when you look over there and you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got 13 new plants that I didn't
have literally an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 13 new plants that are about to
burst into life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should come root around 7 to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could root as early as 4 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't happen very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm real excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one rep for watching and we'll see you
guys soon on Bubble Man's World.
Bye.
