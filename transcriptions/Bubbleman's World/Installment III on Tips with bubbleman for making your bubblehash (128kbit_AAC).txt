[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are with part three of the tip
installment for water hash or ice water
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tips with Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I'm trying to give you guys
some tips for getting through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: without overthinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really one of the biggest places people
have problems is the place that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be helping you with today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the proper drying of the water
extracted hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two schools of thought when it
comes to the drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone agrees that we powderize
basically the people that are considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the experts, I guess, which is somewhat
laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just go out and do the experiments,
if you just go and make the water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize after a while that if you're
not using a desiccant, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: wicking out the moisture from the water
hash, you're going to be left with a
[SPEAKER_00]: process where your hash looks really great
for a while and then it does this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where it butters out and it no longer
holds its form and no longer is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of starts crumbling and falling
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is resin degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wax membrane is being degradated by
the solvent use of the water because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out for longer than it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breaking that head down and
eventually you're left with this sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: less than product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear people say, I used to be so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we can avoid this is following one of
the two schools of thought, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your stainless steel strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take your fresh bubble patty when
it's right in the pressing screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the quality, this is where it
becomes a bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to gently dab some of the water
out of that bubble patty, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water I say because leaving some of the
water present will allow you to put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the strainer and with the back of a spoon,
you can gently push it through the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and what happens is it falls out as
a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't make the mistake on allowing
this powder to pool up on the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is as you're pushing
gently with the spoon, rubbing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the screen between the hash and
the spoon and it's falling, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moving it over your thick cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you are cringing out there
right now and you think it's an old school
[SPEAKER_00]: method but the cardboard is a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to use cardboard,
my good buddy KK, he puts it on a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: and then under the screen he packs paper
towels and those paper towels wick the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture out of the bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot just put the bubble,
the water hash, ice wax, solventless,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just put this on a parchment
paper or on a piece of glass or on a plate
[SPEAKER_00]: because that will not wick the moisture
out and air drying is not going to be good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough unless you're in an extremely dry,
dry place and even still the resin will
[SPEAKER_00]: bond itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you powder it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more exposure to surface area,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cardboard will wick more moisture out
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one school of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second school of thought is a
microplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a V-syndicate card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your average microplane but I
couldn't find mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might have left it at Remo's the
last time I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little card with holes in it
and you can literally freeze the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to allow some of the
moisture to come out before you freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of allowing the resin
patty to sit for a short period of time on
[SPEAKER_00]: some paper towel or on towel below the
screen that it's sitting on so you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting fibers in your hash and it can
wick that moisture out and at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: when it gets to a certain point you can
freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freezing will remove more moisture but
it will get it ready for microplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take those frozen patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really high quality resin I
suggest breaking off small pieces of the
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen patty like a gram at a time and
microplaning them and allowing as it falls
[SPEAKER_00]: out, allowing it to fall spread thin on
the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always use plenty of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use little pieces that are this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use giant pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit them into trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to use cardboard you can
use 4x4 screens like these ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these metal frame screens that
sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can basically get them built into
frames that they sit above one another and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can basically put the hash on the top
and then underneath you can put the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel as a desiccant to wick the moisture
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are our two schools of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our microplane and our stainless steel
siever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever way you're going about doing it
you'll learn the way and it's best for you
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately by making a mistake here and
there but hopefully these tips can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you get your bubble broken into powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fine powder spread very thin on a
thick cardboard or using a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: desiccant like paper towel that's stuffed
under the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be in direct contact to really
allow gravity to pull that water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone to so much trouble in the
growing of this cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the variables to get it to the point
where the resin is mature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome head is thinned and the
profile inside is abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've extracted the resin and we've
done the right job on using all the bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolating the heads into their micron
size increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last most important thing and
I urge all of you to really learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry your water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish it off with a little
dab of the 5 year cured I've got right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a quick little dab a doodle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the D nail right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alright here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great taste on that 5 year cure and you
can never keep hash for this long without
[SPEAKER_00]: drying it first properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never last for 5 years and taste
this good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one more reason to dry your
hash properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the tips have helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you soon on Bubble Man's World.
