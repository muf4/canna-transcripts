[SPEAKER_00]: hey guys bubble man here just about to
take a rip here on the sublimator from
[SPEAKER_00]: Enrico this is an amazing incredible new
device that I just recently got turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: to and aside from the fact that it's a
gasification process sublimation turning
[SPEAKER_00]: the solid into a gas without going through
a liquid I can't say enough about how it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects the hit how wonderful it tastes
even though this is a plastic tube and I
[SPEAKER_00]: never smoke out of plastic tubes although
I suspect I'll get myself the wand working
[SPEAKER_00]: with just a glass ball in the near future
but for now I'll show it's as simple as
[SPEAKER_00]: loading up a little bowl or a big one for
that matter some watermelon foam out
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that in your mouth and dropping
this into the chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty incredible size vapor hit it
dissipates very fast in the air the taste
[SPEAKER_00]: is unparalleled particularly once you
start playing around with the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it to that perfect heat
temperature that was a dry hit through a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic tube I'm not even coughing the
size of the vapor molecules the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks them down allows it to get so deep
into your lungs everyone has said it once
[SPEAKER_00]: they've exhaled it it's this incredible
permeation and the terpenes in your mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: and in your throat really quite a good
little unit I'm sure there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: left here
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway that's the sublimator hope you
enjoyed we're gonna have more videos of it
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up soon and myself the bubble bag
booth and sublimator will be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: treating yourself expo from May 24th to
26th so hopefully we'll see you there
