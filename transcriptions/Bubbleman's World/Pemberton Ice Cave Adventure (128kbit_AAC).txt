[SPEAKER_22]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world

[SPEAKER_22]: I'm doing something Well, I'm partially
doing something that I've been talking
[SPEAKER_22]: about for a long time bringing you all
with me I'm finally getting up to the
[SPEAKER_22]: Pemberton ice caps to go visit some of the
epic fucking ice caves up there beautiful
[SPEAKER_22]: beautiful ice caves really majestic and
and and deeply deeply Spiritual places
[SPEAKER_22]: very quiet and unique places a place that
you won't spend a lot of your life in And
[SPEAKER_22]: so the short time that you do get to spend
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's always very much appreciated
particularly by me I just did my wake and
[SPEAKER_22]: bake video my 13th episode and took about
oh I'd say three or four rips of this
[SPEAKER_22]: particular rosin some Congo from 120
micron bubble Very strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_22]: Very very tasty So I'm gonna have one more
rip just with you guys, but I thought I'd
[SPEAKER_22]: do a short little interlude sort of intro
to this video for the day I'm not gonna do
[SPEAKER_22]: the regular, you know Take the camera and
set it up in my vehicle so you can kind of
[SPEAKER_22]: drive up the road with me Probably we'll
just start in the parking lot pulling the
[SPEAKER_22]: sleds off a lot of it's gonna be first
person at least getting to the The spots
[SPEAKER_22]: will be first person on my GoPro and then
I'll have my camera as well Just to film a
[SPEAKER_22]: little bit of the ice caves.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's mostly what I'm looking to do.
[SPEAKER_22]: Just film some nice action.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh There we go getting little little
messages about my stripe account kind Of
[SPEAKER_22]: felt like I just wanted to make sure that
wasn't a fraud Email, but it's not so it's
[SPEAKER_22]: all very good news.
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy 420 Day after 420 to everyone.

[SPEAKER_22]: Vancouver Which is going to be its own
video so you can watch that on my channel
[SPEAKER_22]: as well And it was pretty good pretty good

myself t40 t4 20k And Johnny B and of
[SPEAKER_22]: course Jody Emory was there and marijuana

off without a hitch It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was great even saw Raekwon from the
from the Wu Tang clan at one point in time
[SPEAKER_22]: walking around and puffing big blunts So

[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm good for this, you know,
I just don't want to go ripping down into
[SPEAKER_22]: the cave, of course No, you got to know
that you can get up
[SPEAKER_22]: What about over there I see people have
gone over that way because it's a hole it
[SPEAKER_22]: looks yeah, it could be a peace but Well,
maybe we're not going in the ice cave Look
[SPEAKER_22]: at that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we're to the next ice cave if I can
get my sled started because it stopped
[SPEAKER_22]: working when we got here
My 5d wasn't getting so
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of easy to come down sideways Oh
[SPEAKER_22]: My god is that ever a beautiful image This
guy is so blue behind her it doesn't look
[SPEAKER_22]: real really
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, we made it guys I'm here in the
original ice cave the first ice cave that
[SPEAKER_22]: I was ever brought to on the Pemberton ice
caps and it is absolutely fucking cool
[SPEAKER_22]: goes down in there Ryan's down there
Ricarda's over here and that was our
[SPEAKER_22]: entrance to climb down into the cave and
We've got this pretty beautiful ice behind
[SPEAKER_22]: us.
[SPEAKER_22]: It'd be nice to come in and run a batch of
bubble hash in here I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a nice ice got the client up here
didn't bring water down from my From my
[SPEAKER_22]: sled and it was quite a walk to get down
here with all my equipment so we're just
[SPEAKER_22]: gonna hit it as is and Oh, I guess you
know what I'll do the timer within my head
[SPEAKER_22]: Time it in my head
[SPEAKER_22]: Be great it's good to know, you know
[SPEAKER_22]: Little bit cold out so I'll heat it up a
little bit more than usual Then you got
[SPEAKER_22]: the timer all right click it give it a go
Well, that's okay, we'll do it with the
[SPEAKER_22]: wrist tech sometimes iPhone timers do that
you go to hit it and it just goes zero
[SPEAKER_22]: zero zero It doesn't really engage that
wasn't bad five seconds late All right,
[SPEAKER_22]: so we'll take the first hit using the
flashlight to carb the It's the only thing
[SPEAKER_22]: I have that's not like plastic,
you know Exactly give thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I Think we're just gonna hit this here
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do it.
Perfect Congo
[SPEAKER_22]: for the win man was that delicious
Delicious mildly chased up the banger,
[SPEAKER_22]: but not too bad

boat, you know, you got a rosin press In

[SPEAKER_22]: pull me right in And let me show you where
we're at guys
[SPEAKER_22]: Jesus That's ridiculous Really We can walk
right through This is an absolutely
[SPEAKER_22]: stunning ice cave This is one of the
nicest caves I've ever been to That is
[SPEAKER_22]: fucking crazy Holy
[SPEAKER_22]: shit This is unbelievable Yeah,
[SPEAKER_22]: just how beautiful this wall looks right
there It's fucking crazy You don't want to
[SPEAKER_19]: stay under that part too long?
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I didn't want to stay under there for
much time at all Even that's walking on
[SPEAKER_22]: the creek too When you're in the middle
Wow,
[SPEAKER_22]: so I'm right inside a cave now This is
absolutely spectacular I think this is
[SPEAKER_22]: where I would love To make some water hash
Some bubble hash You can really see these
[SPEAKER_22]: spots too People have climbed way into
them And you can go And keep going down
[SPEAKER_22]: Into the entrance I'm not going to but
Pretty cool That's a cool little tunnel
[SPEAKER_22]: that goes for a while
[SPEAKER_22]: Beautiful In and out So, bubble man in the
ice cave Like I told you I would be God is
[SPEAKER_22]: this fucking killer So ridiculous I want
to take pictures I want to make video I
[SPEAKER_22]: want to do all these different things But
I'm gonna have to take my time And do one
[SPEAKER_22]: at a time
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see quite a ways into both of them
This is kind of neat I think I came in
[SPEAKER_22]: that way Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_22]: Rolled in on the belly?
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, there was no snow there a couple
weeks ago Oh, jeez Happens fast,
[SPEAKER_22]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_22]: Looks great with the light shining in I
[SPEAKER_22]: can't even explain to you guys How
ridiculous this thing is Let's see if I
[SPEAKER_22]: can turn Oh, you don't even need the light
on here See the ice?
[SPEAKER_22]: How trippy it is?
[SPEAKER_19]: Super, super trippy shit Okay
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just climbed through this tiny little
porthole And got to I guess what I would
[SPEAKER_22]: call A pretty epic location Very limited
with my height Let me get to a spot here
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can show you where I'm at Ice cave
that way Exit Outside that way And then
[SPEAKER_22]: Looks like A substantial distance around
this corner Can be taken But I won't be
[SPEAKER_22]: doing that So you see sometimes these
networks go forever Obviously it makes
[SPEAKER_22]: sense to be very careful When you're in
these zones Particularly this time of year
[SPEAKER_22]: The melt is occurring You can hear it
happening You don't want to put yourself
[SPEAKER_22]: in a situation That's more dangerous than
it needs to be So be careful out there But
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah Absolutely stunning Stunning Head in
here for a little bit Just to show you
[SPEAKER_22]: guys what's going on Old man's world
Getting you out there to the ice cave
[SPEAKER_22]: First time This is what cannabis is all
about to me Using it as a medicine And
[SPEAKER_22]: allowing myself to be inspired And to be
touched By nature In these zones You know,
[SPEAKER_22]: glass ice wall in front of me That's like
I can see two, three feet right into it
[SPEAKER_22]: Right above me as well It's just beautiful
So I'm glad to be bringing you guys here
[SPEAKER_22]: in 4K I'm going to go see if my friends
want to come over here for the sesh Or if
[SPEAKER_22]: they want to have the sesh over there But
we are going to have a sesh real quick
[SPEAKER_22]: here Alright, we're in the ice cave
everybody This is the ice cave sesh The
[SPEAKER_22]: one you've all been waiting for I did kind
of lose my carb cap Flash light,
[SPEAKER_22]: it's not even mine But I'm sure it's in my
bag somewhere Am I ready what?
[SPEAKER_18]: For your appearance?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, here let me move out of the way And
you can make your appearance Alright You
[SPEAKER_08]: ready?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep That's hilarious Alright, so this is
our shelf that we can stand on without
[SPEAKER_22]: cutting our heads off And maybe someone
can hold this I'll get on the timer again
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, excellent, your card is on the timer
I've got shards of this, smell this card
[SPEAKER_02]: You always have fragrant stuff,
that's for sure Yeah, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_22]: fragrant Sometimes Sometimes it's going to
be fragrant Clean this off a little bit,
[SPEAKER_22]: have a little bit of stuff that we don't
want on there So we are like literally,
[SPEAKER_22]: what would you guys say from just the
parking lot?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at least 60, I'd say 60,
maybe even 75 kilometers from the parking
[SPEAKER_02]: lot In a straight line, we've traveled
further than that though Right How cool is
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Incredible Where we are standing here,
the ice is at least 15,000 years old Wow
[SPEAKER_02]: 15,000 or more Wow Pretty cool I just need
a little chunk back of my whiskey No,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know why?
[SPEAKER_18]: Because actually there could be bacteria
in this water I know, I know, I know Of
[SPEAKER_12]: what?
[SPEAKER_18]: Bacteria Oh yeah We had so many times to
be frozen in this ice And you never know
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, Riccardo with the schooling We got
all the bubble bag colors Red and blue and
[SPEAKER_12]: green and yellow Maybe a little black You
got that timer?
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to turn it on now,
perfect I was a little worried about the
[SPEAKER_22]: torch, it was not, well it wasn't turning
on Oh yeah Lots of things seem to be doing
[SPEAKER_22]: that today Yeah, I wish I had that
flashlight, carving this would be super
[SPEAKER_22]: key But, well, it is what it is You know
the quartz, if it's too hot If it's too
[SPEAKER_22]: hot on top it will be no bueno,
the plastic would melt to it I'll just
[SPEAKER_22]: take a big airy hit in the ice cave What's
wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_22]: What are we at?
[SPEAKER_22]: 30 It's still pretty hot It does make me
want to find that flashlight though I
[SPEAKER_22]: remember putting it tight with my video
camera and my camera Maria's 43 Alright,
[SPEAKER_18]: let's do it How cool
[SPEAKER_18]: is that?
[SPEAKER_18]: It worked Just chilling you in the cave
Wow, that didn't work too bad Don't
[SPEAKER_18]: forget, it's much chiller than that
Booyah, there's so many more to pick up I
[SPEAKER_22]: can throw my carb cap down after my rip
Alright, so, you want to hold that?
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure I'll hold this I'll find this I'm
going to do our cleanliness thing,
[SPEAKER_20]: because cleanliness is godliness The best
we can anyway This is my travel jazz
[SPEAKER_22]: banner, so it's okay if I get some jazz
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, I'll actually hold that I think
there's a real order to this And I think
[SPEAKER_22]: putting the hash on Before you leave is
key Yep, I think so Otherwise,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, you may crumble and the gong may
fall over or your torch or anything's
[SPEAKER_18]: possible You're just not ready for it And
then you missed your dab and you wasted
[SPEAKER_22]: all that money And I hate butane as it is
It's pretty much my least favorite thing
[SPEAKER_22]: in this experience It's not a bad sound
when your dab makes the sound of broken
[SPEAKER_22]: glass I wasn't sure when it was going to
happen I wasn't sure when we were going to
[SPEAKER_22]: get out here I mean, I knew you guys would
get out I wasn't sure when I was going to
[SPEAKER_18]: get out here I was going to make you guys
get out of bed a lot Don't be working too
[SPEAKER_12]: much, can you believe it?
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want to pick up a nice flat
piece of ice for your carb cap Nice flat
[SPEAKER_18]: piece That's not very interesting A little
bit bigger than here, that one might work
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, that one was nice, thank you
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would be a full 50 seconds on
that one I heated it up good and put all
[SPEAKER_18]: the black out Ah,
[SPEAKER_20]: what a beautiful place to take bong reps
It's unparalleled Right?
[SPEAKER_22]: Excellent We've got people coming out of
page from all angles around us
[SPEAKER_22]: That is indeed funny The whole experience
has been epic Some of those open areas
[SPEAKER_22]: where we were sledding I was just like
It's so mind blowing It's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_22]: only thing I really hear is Like just
constantly It's like that part in the
[SPEAKER_22]: movie where everything is amazing with the
sun shining through It's almost like
[SPEAKER_22]: there's supposed to be an orchestra
traveling beside you Just playing epic
[SPEAKER_02]: music Yeah, I know for real It's so
amazing The views as you're coming down,
[SPEAKER_22]: it's just like They can bring you to tears
Like if you really thought about it It's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty vast up here A little one for Ry
guy It's a little bit bigger than here,
[SPEAKER_22]: but it'll be fine Remember, I got to get
us back Put it this way, if you don't get
[SPEAKER_22]: back, we're not getting back But we're
pretty good to go Hey, you still got me,
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a total That's right I just never
leave him here If he didn't get back,
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't get back Same Well,
it's pretty nice here, I think we're
[SPEAKER_02]: moving in You tripped out to see a bear
and a bear which seems so close I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think bears live in this stuff They're
sleeping They're sleeping way lower But
[SPEAKER_18]: they go on the ice, I don't know And you
know what, those guys have apparently a
[SPEAKER_18]: dead duck in their teepee Oh really?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know Who's teepee is that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Rory Bushfield That's Rory's point?
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of felt like it might have been
his That's cool I don't know, I've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: the name a couple of times I've met Rory a
couple of times I heard that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of people living in a teepee
somewhere around here And now I've seen
[SPEAKER_22]: the teepee Rory was married to Sarah
That's kind of when I met him I did a
[SPEAKER_22]: thing with Blake Jorgensen, a class
[SPEAKER_22]: And Rory was one of the riders that Blake
had hired to be all around He can do
[SPEAKER_22]: mountain biking, he can do this,
he can do that That's how I met him And
[SPEAKER_22]: then when Sarah passed away I went to her
thing as well up on Whistler in the super
[SPEAKER_22]: pipe there
[SPEAKER_22]: Blow it out, blow it out That was a proper
carving right there That was a proper
[SPEAKER_22]: carving The reason I said blow it out,
blow it out, blow it out is Ryan doesn't
[SPEAKER_22]: need to hold that in for any amount of
time Okay, that's it, we did it,
[SPEAKER_22]: we had an amazing session Thank you both
to Ryan and Ricarda for bringing me here
[SPEAKER_22]: and getting me here and getting all of you
here Thank you Because you guys wouldn't
[SPEAKER_22]: be here with us and I suspect there's
going to be some thousands of you that get
[SPEAKER_22]: to see this so Enjoy the beauty,
yeah, we're going to shred for the rest of
[SPEAKER_22]: the day We might pull the pipe out again
but we'll see
[SPEAKER_22]: Just getting back to the middle is going
to be
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, I think so I would never guess that's
great Because actually This is the way we
have to go
This is super trippy
Super trippy Whenever
[SPEAKER_19]: I see rocks I'm happy because they give a
perfect amount of grip Spectacular
[SPEAKER_19]: Spectacular Definitely

zone and I thought I'd give you guys a
[SPEAKER_22]: little peek at where we are pretty epic
[SPEAKER_22]: Got it going on here, yes we are recording
You can hear people blasting around,
[SPEAKER_22]: there's an ice cave over there Lots of
slumped little avalaches And just
[SPEAKER_22]: beautiful beautiful epicness This is of
course the Pemberton backcountry Just a
[SPEAKER_22]: little bit north of Whistler for those of
you wondering Definitely not something you
[SPEAKER_22]: want to just drive out here and go into
without any Guides or people that can you
[SPEAKER_22]: know protect and help save your life But
it is definitely a beautiful place if you
[SPEAKER_22]: can put it all together and get it all
right So you have a crew of people willing
[SPEAKER_22]: to take you out here Figured I'd share
