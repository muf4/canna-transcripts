[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World,
and welcome to this week's episode of Puff
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday, which, uh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting sunglasses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is as nice as summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it, Summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The atomical haze next to you flowering
says no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, no, it sure feels like summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, uh, we waited for a while to film
because there was all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_00]: noises going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't it funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: A helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: First it was a chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had the planer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was the planer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had the chop saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the chop saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had my son going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're cool with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just decided we'd rather film
something, uh, which really will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: consist of me and Johnny sitting here
puffing on our own motherships.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's got the straight fab with the IDAB
drop down and the silicon carbide nail
[SPEAKER_00]: from D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the, uh, Faberge egg for
mothership as well as the straight fab,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the puking bee, the puking bee,
um, quartz crystal bolt and D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start this off in the red?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, I got some different,
nice sift here though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always down for some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't, oh, there's the
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how certain people might get it
in their heads and on a beautiful day like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, the best thing to do would probably
be to light up your leaf blower or light
[SPEAKER_00]: up your lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go out and hammer your nail gun into
the wall a couple thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get your planer out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get your chainsaw out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just run the boat motor for a couple
of hours straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, filter the gas out of the
engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me laugh so hard when you said
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it seems like when the sun comes out,
a few people decide they want to ruin it
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody else for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can see the view, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a most epic of views.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very few neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly sparse, but because it's so
quiet that really any little noise you
[SPEAKER_00]: make, let alone a big noise is going to be
fairly heard by the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for instance, I'm sure right now there
are people hearing our episode of Puff
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday while they just walk by on the
street or whether they're out on their
[SPEAKER_00]: decks across, you know, next door or
across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to actually be the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be the first bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm taking it past the first
bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I actually cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny stepping up his game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might've heard me in Hash Church the
other day saying, John, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step up your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so close that last little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it seems to make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I grow my own residence and I put
all the effort into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't I be cleaning it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which cause I was just like, that's
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, I'm thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice your thumb was on the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't notice for the first few,
few hits I took, but that thing had a carb
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw that beautiful little car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I really like about it is it
fits on the silicone carbide, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: monster nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how other caps fit in it,
but inevitably that just gets the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cap kind of nasty dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a few things that I'm nervous
about other people using it on this pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be as much, but this piece,
where it's right here, let if it fell,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just hit the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit since, uh, since seeing
Brett Maverick's broken egg on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just knowing that glass breaks,
seeing glass break over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really take precious care as much as I,
you know, I clean these things every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as often as I clean them, I still take
very precious care to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: their, uh, their safety is secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a little D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: OJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best part of all this is it's
simultaneous diving today, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are one of the few people that require
the bong more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's nice to just be able to offer
you your own bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your hash and your dabber and your
dabinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that melted like water as I pulled the
pipe and dripped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry you didn't get to see it guys,
but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was bigger than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to have a grape after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how big that riff was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carb cap comes in handy for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some trippy wipes to clean the dabbers
if they get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure come in handy, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sure come in handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember coughing a lot last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck was a little sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess coughing can cause you a
little pain when you've got a sore back
[SPEAKER_00]: and a sore neck and you're all messed up
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else is going on in Johnny B's
world these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using your LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in my world?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm building that hot tub.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I'm really, really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you back on hot yoga?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still taking a break?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a little bit of yoga,
but I can't actually go to the studio and
[SPEAKER_02]: do a lot of the neck exercises right now,
which is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's both my health and stuff,
but I'm not stopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always locking the standing leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about your health and stuff like
that, so paying a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amino acids, natural supplements,
eating properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, making epic 420 pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, staying on top of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well have a little hit of the
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's looking proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's just such a beautiful,
relaxing, hot Wednesday.
I'm relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thinking about the new growing season
that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the outdoors we want
to start doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just a few of the plans to see
how they're going to ... Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: that outdoor resident, I would really,
really, really like to take a better look
[SPEAKER_02]: on this year's crop that I've never paid
attention to, which is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: stock and just what the difference is
between the indoor and outdoor stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: because something was brought up with the
inside LED light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that the stock in the center was
more healthier with the LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was thicker and heavier, which actually
even looked healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't already checked out
Hash Church, obviously check out those
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 92 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: 19 was awesome on the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 episodes so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 22 was all ... Dude, I'm telling
you, they've all got gems in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one's got a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably like 40 hours of them,
or maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 80 hours of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have pieces of paper written
with the Hash Church on the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have times of people talking to go
back and reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure there's a few people out
there doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you've got to do, because
there's so much good information being
[SPEAKER_02]: passed on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to not watch Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure you guys all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, loving this fab bag, I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of missed the drop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really enjoying the drop down on it,
but I think one that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller is in order for the fab bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a really good size for the
straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that's a little bit smaller for the
fab bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it'll come down the pipeline here
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how this looks like silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the right shade of the light,
it literally looks like pieces of silver
[SPEAKER_00]: are on the rim of the ...
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you though, the Barb is
special resin, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I not tell you that from day one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I have it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take some macro photos, and I'll do a
nice little close-up video with it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, because in the sunlight,
it just looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that look beautiful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hit this NYCD?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just hit the NYCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit this a few seconds after you hit
one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you don't have to back-to-back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the only thing I would say with this
nail is kind of as you're using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just lightly, any little minimal
amounts of carbon, little residuals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are left, I just lightly scrape off,
and then I usually pick up the bong,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hold it over the edge.
Give it a blow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but with my eyes closed,
because, wow, getting that in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it in my eye one time, and I'll tell
you, it was not a good plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Jamaica on my last trip,
and I blew the silicone carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, shit went right in my eye,
and it wasn't until the next day that I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a, you never want to muck
up your eye when you're out traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, you never want to muck out
your eye anywhere, but doing it while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out and about in a different
country is freaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, though, how it's buttered
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I was barely able to put that into a
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was barely able to press that into a
solid piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have absorbed some moisture
from the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the problem even with the
Medi here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I opened it up and it clumped right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's another one that I went and
spent a couple of hours on, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I had to step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you, what a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a difference when you get those
screens on, and without them, you cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: get what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's talking about the Dry Sift Quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that may have missed the
boat and don't know about it, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: check these out at bubblebag.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on the left side and look under Dry
Sift Tools, and it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, for me, every time,
I get lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing the first bounce, and I
thought it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was bringing new resin to clean
for me and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was talking to Horatio,
who was bringing me some really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just a matter of sitting
down and after spending so much love and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it, and this time I decided to Dry
Sift it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last time I was fresh frozen and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was talking about, you know,
the Dry Sift for me, I was always carding
[SPEAKER_02]: for hours, and that's why I got away from
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with just the temperatures,
the humidities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperatures I got paid a big attention
to, and I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get the temperatures down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the humidities down cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've now taken it to get those humidities
down to 30% lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes your job easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, hands down, the resin is
coming out perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the curing at those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to give it your Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how quick that came?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised she still has something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, and she smells so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to really explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a smell that I don't recognize
every time I smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready for something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our planer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the planer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the planer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all sorts of different sounds
here on Bubbly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pretty much say next time,
that was just the first bounce of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaican, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until we have like a kilo of
this so we can clean it down to like 100
[SPEAKER_00]: grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been puffing all this all the last
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my resin I've been cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got that and it just like smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wait until it's grown with the
tropical sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as much as we want to try right
now, we know that our lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: insufficient in producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's going to be hard to create
a light that can compete with that giant
[SPEAKER_00]: glowing orb in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I salute all of you that are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, wow, sun-grown resin
is going to be something that I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to in the future of all
these different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple more grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a grape, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had a grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaican outdoor-grown resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know where it's going to be at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole light spectrum and the
difference between the indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've been trying to achieve for
the last 12 or 13 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light bulbs is outdoor spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the sun, there's many,
many countries in the world will be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to become contenders for growing a unique
cannabinoid profile, a unique terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're only looking at getting to
those fresh heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's quite exciting, actually,
to see the route that it's all about to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, pretty excited to be heading
back to Jamaica, going back there next
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have been invited by Ras
Bobby, Bobby Dredd, to go check out this
[SPEAKER_00]: little cup event that he's been doing in
Negril for the last 12 or 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty chill, smaller thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real rootsy and amazing people
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're super stoked to check that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to Google that up,
I wish I had the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to Negril, I don't know if
you'd call it a cannabis cup, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a high times thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just look it up here real quick,
and we can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, yeah, it's something that... When
is the next cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Spain is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona is on 20, 21, 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having a secret cup, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see this cup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure what the backslash is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for it to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm quicker than my technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pondens.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers all over Jamaica take part in
marijuana exhibition displaying the finest
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stepping High Festival, March 7th and 8th,
2015, Negril, Jamaica, put on by Ras Bobby
[SPEAKER_00]: from IAMedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I-Y-A-H.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been doing this since 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to come check us out,
I'm going to be down there with Tony and I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe Don from DNA helping do some
judging and being on a panel to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are going to be around down in
Jamaica, come check us out at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out pondens.com for
information potentially on how you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: in touch with some tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, might as well give them a shout
out for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the link in the comment section
so you don't have to Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it even easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I forget the simplicity of
YouTube sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our planer and our chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double, double, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get a triple?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we get these bombs going?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Puff Wednesday and really all we
got today is that we want to puff with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving the Medi for last, but right
now, this Barbara that I, once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was the crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone goes, what do you mean by
crushing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I get it like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really, really, really low
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of like crushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you get that cough,
I think at the beginning of the song,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a nice rip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's, you got it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time, every time you cough,
I sing in that song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the puff puff pass cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the puff puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set off by my cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you even try to plan such a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard getting off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, I just realized now you'll
be able to turn it inside and just go up
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, the little middle hole thing
there and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny's no no noob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you, it sure is an
epically beautiful day for February,
[SPEAKER_00]: what 16th or something.
17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we call deep winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally the coldest time of the
year here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it must be 13 or 14 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no snow on the local mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came over today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they closed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's no snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must be closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent has to be closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grows mountain has got no snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the whole runway going all the way
up to the peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whistler still has snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember 10 years ago when I was skiing
all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go wild next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in my forties now, so let's step that
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years ago, when I was 20 years ago when
I was skiing, we were skiing to the April
[SPEAKER_02]: 30th when they're supposed to close and
then we'd stay open for the two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's still snow on the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference is- When you hear a
chainsaw or a planer, please, take a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a game we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, could be kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already taken a fair amount of rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always down for some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't hit this barb yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to chain smoke rips if you can
and the beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, God, it is, it's really warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even cold in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually, that one, that,
that might be the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one might be the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I cleaned that this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to take a rip of it and
find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I did an extra clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was like- House of the Great
Gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of the Great Chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of the Great Wood Plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of the Helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of the backing up of the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being called out here with the sound
of the chainsaw.
No,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the Afghani,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real creamy and melted like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to cough like a maniac too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water melting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's always much easier when you
control the variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hash makers that they get their
material given to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are hash makers that either
A, grow their material or have their,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are in control of, in control of
growing their material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, talking with some different hash
makers recently, I find that the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to grow their own on a large
enough scale that they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: produce decent amounts of resin have
really, they seem to shine a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: above the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people that are using trim
and whatnot to make their hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to compete with a guy who's
growing dank bud and then using that bud
[SPEAKER_00]: to make his hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say the growers, they have the
holy grail of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the first bounce, and now that
you, I mean, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're buying bud and you're doing
it, I'm sorry, you're just not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what the growers can achieve.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the epic, it hangs, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in control of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in control of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I control that whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bite, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going off.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to continue on with our day
puffing bowls like mad fiends as we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoying some of the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may or may not see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always kind of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could end up on a boat driving around
the house sound looking for killer whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do, we'll bring you guys along.
If not, see you later for another Puff
Wednesday.
Puffing mad, talking to you.
Climbing out.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Puffing mad.
Puffing mad.
