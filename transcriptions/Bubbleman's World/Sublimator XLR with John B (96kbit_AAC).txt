[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bulbman's World
Once again, John B has come over for a
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful visit and brought me He's
brought me my new sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got the XTR I guess this is like
the sublimator 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's got the removable handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cord comes off Of the actual unit
which I thought was really pretty cool And
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like an old like pretty much like
your band equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the two pin simple click it's got
a little little box here for Dialing in
[SPEAKER_02]: your controller a little heat heat dialer
and then it's got the the same old
[SPEAKER_02]: original bowl this is pretty much The
design that he's had since the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's got the little atomizer On the
inside and it's got the straight pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has sped it up or sped it up He's
tightened it up a little bit my old
[SPEAKER_02]: original one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have here When this part gets heated up,
it started getting loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So We've got the new one, which is nice
and tight fits good into the mothership
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't loose or anything and then the
Sublimator just fits right on top So it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a good idea to type tape your little
sublimator dial box down because the cord
[SPEAKER_02]: is fairly sharp And if you're moving it
around it can cause a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: problems, but just taping that down will
eliminate that And they do not an
[SPEAKER_03]: extension who was saying there yesterday
was talking to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay extension You can actually yeah,
I could see some people wanting to be
[SPEAKER_03]: extended So if they want an extension that
it can be actually here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just drop a little screen in there
We'll see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that fell pretty much to
perfection Strain 101 and we'll just put
[SPEAKER_02]: that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the 101 This is the 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm looking forward to hitting the
101.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is day 101 The sublimator is up to
temperature if you want to slap some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that 101 101 days John bloomed this plant
for basically Special special We're
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to hit some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I've actually hit
her I've been just hitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, that's just really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is nice Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm definitely stoked on that Okay,
so I'm just going to Pack a bowl and here
[SPEAKER_02]: you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exciting Sublimating through this
mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh My gosh was that tasty that's why I was
just a light light Perfect vapor rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I so wanted to hit this on the sublimator
and be just dying to try Got a chance to
[SPEAKER_03]: try with Enrico yesterday and I was like,
I gotta get to Mars Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really glad you came this is that the
taste is just amazing I Mean, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: even describe such a thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so Almost peppery not like Not like
black pepper but like peppers mmm,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's so tasty That's his third rip Tom
that so you know that last one is got all
[SPEAKER_03]: that TAC now It's gonna do a little big
hit which is always my favorite first set
[SPEAKER_03]: third burn for me Depending on the person
we get lots of smoke now So we don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: rid of that beautiful taste in the
beginning and and now he's getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: full What I found was that the first Two
rips were perfect taste But the herb was
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I mean as as it should be it was a
little bit moist still because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to bone it out I would suspect that
or I would suggest that when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting a vaporizer a sublimator The ideal
situation is to throw a little bit of herb
[SPEAKER_02]: in your bubble box Or outside of the jar
and it doesn't need to be dried for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time Sometimes it just seems
like half an hour or 20 minutes out at
[SPEAKER_02]: room temperature makes the herb just the
perfect Dryness for getting that third hit
[SPEAKER_03]: in the first hit along with those terp
hits I Couldn't believe that actually that
[SPEAKER_02]: was John came over one day and was like
hey, we're gonna vape some fresh herb and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just kind of like Wasn't really
feeling it in my mind and then we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: hits and it was Just kind of unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow the flavors once again Just
an amazing flavor with the sublimator And
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see with this new one you can
actually Absolutely, we're gonna get to
[SPEAKER_03]: that There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember talking with him in the
beginning and I was always sticking dry
[SPEAKER_03]: sift in the holes Boy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me clear that for you Very tasty nice
to bring herb back to my palate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I love hash And even when I say
herb, we're really only vaporizing the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin off the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a sense, this is no different than
extracting hash Go Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, I think the sublimators got into
a nice temperature Now it's given nice
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice deep vapor hits the one thing you
know about a sublimator when it's working
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred percent properly is that It's
gonna give you a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much unlike any other herb
vaporizer on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that for dampers the closest You
know and out of a clean mothership pipe
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like that is
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no other option really
that is the option for I can't be hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: a volcano and I can't be You know upper
dampers big and glass and gnarly and I
[SPEAKER_02]: like hitting out of my own piece and
that's one thing that both Sublimator and
[SPEAKER_02]: D now allow for me to do I don't want to
have to buy some special piece that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: With the vaporizer I want it to fit on my
pipe that I'm used to hitting them that I
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy hitting so Anyway, yeah Pretty cool
new product from Enrico and the people at
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator the XTR check them out at I
guess they're at sublimator comm And their
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator sublimator is their Instagram
accounts They've got a or no, sorry their
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube account check them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google sublimator and find all
these accounts and we'll have them at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the Show here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know kind of stoked to well,
maybe we should do some dabs Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: should we get it up one notch You think
all the way up now, would you like to try
[SPEAKER_03]: this one red fresh frozen that we did
because I took that next to 35 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can notch the flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it Definitely just thinking
about because we're I'm liking your
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts John.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is this was the the tops all the
bottoms and I actually kept growing the
[SPEAKER_03]: strain for another 30 days When I took
that down on day 75, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 36 days in total extra cuz gave me the day
101 which was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make sure we show you a little bit of
this too So I think what I'll do for this
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're gonna dab I'm going to
prepare it And that's where the oil slick
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in I've got my whole table covered
in the oil slick here What you've seen on
[SPEAKER_03]: other videos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'm just kind of pushing the
corner over With a little bit of pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: from my finger I'm just kind of trying to
dab a little bit of this product up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, sir
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give it a nice little wafting
Gathering together like Like goop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what to say right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looking at going wow just turned into
brown sugar Yeah, that's what I was just
[SPEAKER_03]: like wow if he acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see if we can't Oh,
no, we'll just right along that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not a whole thing at all It's
just like there's it's like anywhere on
[SPEAKER_03]: that I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love so much about it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like hey, that's that's that's
really convenient There's no hole anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually just pour it on that was
definitely something I was worried about
[SPEAKER_03]: here No, no just right on that edge Watch
a full bowl all the way around that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually It's no residue Oh, dude,
I'm stoked for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice that was that was a cool
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah Something else Why don't I get
you one of those that was like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, why would anyone even use the
supplement?
[SPEAKER_01]: To vaporize if you could just do that You
know or to herb to vape herb as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: hash that was like times ten All right,
this shit is just bubbling up like crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the skillet That's gonna make a
nice photo you want to actually hit huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Okay, I'm gonna stand up let me
clean you're gonna put down Give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: little clean Comes with a nice little
cleaning tool kind of see how it is
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I well you need it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I Like it because I don't dab with
it and I don't want to clean with my
[SPEAKER_02]: skillet tool anytime you're ready
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool design he's tapered in the
nail and Yeah, basically where the holes
[SPEAKER_02]: are tapered the nail in in that whole
ridge Didn't want to leave you hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: there But yeah, very cool little design
he's tapered the ridge in that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: circular piece around the nail You can dab
on so Probably what I'll be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also found when I had my sublimator last
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed putting Hash in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that I got a different tasting hit
as opposed to when I put it right onto the
[SPEAKER_03]: titanium Wow that I'm just getting ripped
after rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like holding in there almost like
it's got a choke on mm-hmm Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, it's like very nice And once again,
we always want to be careful with the unit
[SPEAKER_02]: that's Yeah, it's a large piece of hot
metal and because it has the handle that
[SPEAKER_02]: is attached To a cord.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important that you just always
respect your sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a piece That should be
passed around as much as you go to it if
[SPEAKER_02]: you get comfortable You always use two
hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be confident in just holding
one hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to secure this and It's also
nice to be able to pull it out when you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to clear the bowl and whatnot So
ideally you'd have a nice upright bong if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to use the one that
sublimator supplies with a very large base
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know Not any angle in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bowl should be pointing straight up in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all just my opinions,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say an opinion I think it was a
research design when we had the other one
[SPEAKER_03]: there and we put it on an angle It was
very easily a little bit more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know what has to be up and down
for sure just on the safe and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually also a little cage around it So
you can't burn yourself if you want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that Yeah, and then if it fell out or
dropped it would be not a worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's also Either way you could say a
million things about the design and things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would want to improve about it
Enrico's come a long way the bottom line
[SPEAKER_02]: is since the day I first hit this thing
It's pretty much one of the tastiest rips
[SPEAKER_02]: That you'll get and you can do it with
herb oil or hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do them all simultaneously or
altogether that's simultaneously and And
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making sublimate at the same time
We're actually producing oil So what do we
[SPEAKER_03]: got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some this is your hash your fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is your fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get a nice little hit there
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the sublimator minutes the
second hit is smokier than most firsts
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching everybody John and
ball men coming at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to you soon You You You
