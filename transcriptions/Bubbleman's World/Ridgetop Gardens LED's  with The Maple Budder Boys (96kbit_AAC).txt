[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Bowelman's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Neil Galante in Montreal,
Quebec from the Maple Butter crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are at his R&D facility here where
he's doing a bunch of different sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments using different nutrients and
different lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess today he's going to walk us
through a little bit of what he's been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, what he is doing, and we're going
to do macro photographs, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: full video, and you've got one room in
Bloom as well, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, yeah, well two rooms in Bloom,
one's in the first week of Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go check out under HPS,
and then we have a veggie room under
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceramic Metal Highlights, and we have an
LED room under Flowering right now at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of Flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm glad I brought multiple pairs of
Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got my HPS around my neck,
I got my LEDs on my face, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually bring Metal Highlight ones,
but I'm sure we'll be able to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a good amount of these
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, for those of you that aren't
aware, and I'm sure most of you are aware,
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple Butter's been producing artisan
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They produce incredible quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did meet Neil through a mutual friend of
ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, right away we really clicked it
off because Neil and John, his partner,
[SPEAKER_03]: are really all about quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: They produce incredible quality resin,
really well grown cannabis, and it's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't have to brag about it,
they don't have to puff out their chests
[SPEAKER_03]: when I saw their Nug for the first time,
and I saw their Hash and Rosin,
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew right away that these guys were on
point, which is kind of why I'm here
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well yeah, thanks for the intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had you come out here today because
we've been doing tests for an LED company
[SPEAKER_01]: based out of Montreal, and we've really
surpassed, I think, all expectations with
[SPEAKER_01]: these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used a room that we usually would have
had 12 double-endeds using about 12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: watts in a room with 510 tons of AC,
and we basically changed that to 6,000
[SPEAKER_01]: watts of LEDs, so about half the wattage,
and we're using about a third of the AC
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity that we were using before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are huge numbers for those of you
that run, operate larger facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not mean as much to a small
facility, but when you're getting into a
[SPEAKER_03]: much larger facility, those are very
substantial numbers to be able to cut your
[SPEAKER_03]: wattage in half, and even the lights must
be a little bit more comfortable to be
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're definitely not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get that burn in your neck from
the HPS and things like that when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in your rooms for long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the buds don't get any burn from
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty much stick the bud directly
under the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see light stress because there is
intensity, but you won't see any burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pistols will still be very white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't burn at all, so it's kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I was like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know LED is definitely going to be
something for the future and that we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to look into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just not sure in what companies to
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are basically replacing,
let's say, because I run with four by
[SPEAKER_01]: eight tables, so let's say 2,000 watts
under a four by eight of double-endeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll replace it with 3,000 watts of
LEDs to basically go and get the same heat
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios in the room, so you don't have to
change your tonnage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to change, but you're not
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using way more amperage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were using 10 amps before under two
lights, now you're using 13, 14 amps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It defies the purpose of the LED and what
we're trying to create here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this because we want to go
micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been our plan all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that the regulations were going to
come out eventually, and they finally did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a really clean facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed with the SOP that you guys
have incorporated here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been through the entire facility so
far, and it's just very clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very professionally done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have the schmocks and the booties
and the hair nets and the gloves and
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much everything that just needs to
be on point for a proper facility when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be growing microbials
and fungi and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure that things are
growing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had those problems in the past,
and it's things that we know, moving on
[SPEAKER_01]: into the future, we're going to have to
continue to really be on point because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be stricter when we're going
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go micro, so we need to
adapt ourselves now before we get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get to that micro stage,
it's not going to be something new for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those SOPs will already be our standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been looking at the LED lights,
I suspect, for a while now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been around for five plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few little ones here and there,
tried a few little tests without much
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitch, he's had the same LEDs for about
seven years, and he's been doing quite
[SPEAKER_01]: well with his.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what really gave me the ... I really
wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's going to be the most
efficient way of growing eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can increase the resin production,
which is for me more importantly than
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing the vegetative yield,
although one could argue that the two
[SPEAKER_03]: coincide with one another, that when you
do increase vegetative yield, generally
[SPEAKER_03]: you should get greater surface area and
get more resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that sometimes pumping with CO2,
you'll get less THC at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often we've seen rooms where we had no
CO2, we'd get less of a yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: but much more resin content on our plants
than sometimes with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we do very mild use of CO2
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, maybe 1,000, 1,200 BPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not pumping the rooms to 1,800.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because you guys are trichome
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trichome farmers are focused a little bit
differently than vegetative, that
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition-based model of ... When I say
that, I'm not really calling that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying it's where we were stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were segregated into this mentality of
how much can I get and how fast can I get
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now as things become a lot looser,
a lot more legal, a lot more mainstream,
[SPEAKER_03]: and man, has it become mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an incredible thing how mainstream
cannabis is slowly becoming amongst all
[SPEAKER_03]: the rest of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last two years, it's unbelievable
how it's become a lot more ... I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be ...
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying that in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's still very conservative
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still breaking the boundaries every
year, and it's getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, there's still people that are
deniers, especially here in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the College of Medicines that only
see cannabis good for about four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: different... They'll eat all those words.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will eat all those words.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that the bubble bags are the bridge
between us right now, in the background,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't take those out because you were
coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to maybe run a batch,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to doing some macro
photographs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely looking forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this kind of will be, in a sense,
a part one video, because we really want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to show you not just what it
looks like in photographs and in video,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also the actual numbers versus what
they would normally get.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be able to give you the vegetative
weight of the room that we're going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: photograph and video, and then we'll also
be able to give you the resin content,
[SPEAKER_03]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid and terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have everything tested,
so we have all the different rooms are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically going to have different ... Not
the different rooms, but the different
[SPEAKER_01]: tables all have different spectrums of
lighting underneath them, so we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to really see if they have different
terpene development under different
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to have analyzed
to really see which light is the key,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're still in testing,
and we're still trying to follow up the
[SPEAKER_01]: right model to be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going more towards a hybrid model,
so a little bit of white and deep red
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that it's the best mix because you
can get stronger plants under those
[SPEAKER_01]: whites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fall over as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get those hollow stems like you
do under those deep reds or HPSs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to build the right recipe,
and I think we've gotten pretty close.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are growing exclusively with
canna nutrients currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we are doing canna
nutrients and soil balance pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil balance pro, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you might remember soil balance
pro from Hash Church when he came on and
[SPEAKER_03]: started talking about the different
beneficial bacterias for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, interesting concept of
collecting these from all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: assembling this real big recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant's healthy, and it works really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like canna nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two years, we've pretty much
tried every single nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've stuck to canna now just because
we're doing more testing on lighting at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment, so we kind of want to have the
same base that we know what we're working
with.
Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be changing too many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if it just becomes too many different
variables, like you said, then you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: really claim anything at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty much running on canna right
now, very base.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't feed very high, so 800,
900 PPMs, and that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm looking forward to walking
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have some workers in the
background working, I guess, trimming down
[SPEAKER_03]: the canopy on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pruning in the HPS room
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten pretty thick, so they're doing
a little pruning today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just walk in the facility and I'll
show you guys around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bring the camera lens for the HPS
room, but I do have my Method 7s,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'll end up taking off my wide angle
lens and just putting my Method 7s in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of my camera so they can get that
nice, clean light rather than that orange
[SPEAKER_03]: hue that would inevitably come through on
the camera, which is really just a very
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful way of showing just how effective
the Method 7 glasses are when you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That orange light can really cause
headaches and discomfort over long periods
[SPEAKER_03]: of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just see when I come in with the
camera, I'll keep it orange, and then I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: put the glasses over top of the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure many of you have seen the
Instagram shots on Method 7's account,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's definitely why you'll see
everyone in the room wearing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a game changer when it comes to
growing in comfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really love to work with Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great guys, and the glasses are
great, so it's the next level stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go for a little tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take us in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Protection UV obligatoire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That says UV protection is...
[SPEAKER_01]: Essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for lights anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some extra UV lights at the end
of the flowering session that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's get Method 7 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three rooms of the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about 300 square feet rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have six four by eight tables on each
that are on rollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is under these double-ended
lights, which everybody seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing under at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first experience with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're a little intense for the
type of farming that I usually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you definitely feel the heat on
your neck in here and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the AC works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, plants are doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what cultivar do we have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all where's my bike at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a full run of bike in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a weekend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is about five days in,
so they're just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bikes, they pop at usually seven to
eight days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed under the LED lights,
which I was very surprised, is they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually started popping at about five to
six days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually got heads out a little bit
faster, and also the plants were not
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed from the transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from ceramic metal highlights to
LEDs, and they didn't get that transition
[SPEAKER_01]: shock where these got a little bit at the
beginning of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming back at the moment,
but that's what I really... I can notice
[SPEAKER_01]: the differences between the double-ended
or the LEDs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all our rooms, we also have these
little antenna things.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are basically monitoring our light
intensity, our CO2 levels, our humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, temperature levels at different
heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have light canopy, we have plant
canopy, and we also do bottom canopy at
[SPEAKER_01]: the table so that we really get the
humidity readings and the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: readings inside of the plant canopy,
not just on the ambient exterior
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what program are you using for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using a service called DataCan,
and it's somebody at Robin's.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of ours that's programming it,
and it does really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a few LPs right now to
introduce this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got it all on a laptop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our CO2 emitters hooked on to
the laptop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we've got all of the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: When lights turn on, CO2 turns on and up
to our readings in our plant canopies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can have the different
readings from the different tables as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're collecting all your data,
but more importantly, you're able to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at it and read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In real time, anywhere you are outside of
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get an email if ever my CO2 tank is dead
or something like that, temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put different alerts for different
peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 80% humidity and things like that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get them on my cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, look, it's not, you know,
we still hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing any feeding systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, which that's something
we're going to look into eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely like working with COCO
in all our rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we go in there pretty much every
two days to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are very clean underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to prune them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important to keep these plants clean
underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any type of little breakage really becomes
a vector for contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some things like we do super cropping
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'll have some elbows on our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit like the Soma technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of, instead of, you know,
cutting our, plucking our heads,
[SPEAKER_01]: we basically just do a super crop,
an elbow on our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a few more heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, these go through about three or
four super cropping weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's a nice comfortable room to
be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the ease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you guys are collecting your
data points, you know, not only for the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that it becomes important to be able
to, you know, when you're not feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable or you've got that intuitive
feeling, like you want to know what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great way to be able to go on the
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: You showed it to us yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make a little video of it later
where we can show them exactly all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different graphs and how well it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, and now we're seeing like it's
all this, the peaks and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in a room like this, we have five
tons of AC, 12,000 Watts of double ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works good together, but we're
definitely not efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, we're using five tons to
fill this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the other room, we're having
more spikes at the moment on our data
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have, I still have a five ton
AC there and I've been dropping it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trying to use it as low,
as less possible we can, but we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe two tons out of the five and we're
still getting a lot of spikes in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just too big for the room
that we're running at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LEDs burn at about 45 degrees Celsius,
whereas these burn at 700.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to filter out as many of those
spikes as possible and really have a nice,
[SPEAKER_03]: even graph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the other thing is also to be
careful because at first I kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: lost in these data graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you, you just start looking at
it and you start tweaking everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: your room and then everything starts
moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you have to get lost to be
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started working a lot with the
VPD as well with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, wouldn't you say the most valuable
lessons you've ever learned from growing
[SPEAKER_03]: was making mistakes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had our fair share of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why you're a great grower
because the best growers, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: are the ones that have made the most
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's hard for some people to wrap
their heads around, you know, but it works
[SPEAKER_03]: for photography, for instruments,
for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the more errors you make,
the more understanding you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we did, you know, this is our
third crop in this facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our first one was a bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried about 12 different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had tested some, there was a few that
weren't tested and then one ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: hermene at week three, right underneath
the top colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see it pollinated and you know,
fucked us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, we turned around and we,
you know, we made sure not to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: mistake again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The canopy looks very healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle row looks a little, you know,
a little intense under the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sides look a little bit better,
I find, at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to have a little bit of tweaking
to do, but definitely looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going down there, Mitch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping things healthy?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a nice breeze in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure it'll be nice top fat colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've helped a little bit out with the
water filtration system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water, recipes, you know, we're all a good
team of buddies here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to get better quality
trichomes, better quality resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: better quality vaping, dabbing,
and reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean, clean, that's what we're aiming
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: This room, what he's doing here is a lot
of R&D and like he says, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're learning from your mistakes,
but it's how fast you learn from them and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much you can learn through different
angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just all building a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the challenge is every room is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right now we're growing room,
we're building light, we're building the
[SPEAKER_01]: sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're constantly adjusting ourselves
and, you know, learning more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's what our
fuss is, and that's fuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, learning about all the
different types of lighting and taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: right decisions while we're going to go
micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we've held out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't wanted to go LP because to be
quite honest, we'd like to be able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, smoke a joint in our facility,
maybe not in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we do like a little bit of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, bioassay, in my opinion,
is an extremely important factor that
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be getting lost in the LP system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Canada is not really allowing for
the importance of, I mean, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: gas chromatograph and all these sorts of
tests are important, but what's more
[SPEAKER_03]: important?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're building beer, when you're
building, when you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's hugely important to be able to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is at the end of the day, the computer can
tell you a bunch of things, but why don't
[SPEAKER_01]: all the vineyards have these machines
testing for terpenes because it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: palette.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely something to lobby health
Canada for in the sense that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe not everyone at the facility is
sitting back and puffing tough all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, but having a cannabis sommelier,
having a professional, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: trained olfactory specialist come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're going to have to,
because especially with the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be allowed to buy from
micros now, you know, testing is one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but, you know, like you can still
have punk weed that passes through
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is going to be, is how are
you going to determine the price of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that you're going to pay your,
you know, what does it bring you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you want to have micro dabs,
point one dab, just to see where it brings
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the vibe?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your bio essay?
[SPEAKER_02]: What positivity does it bring you?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it make your eyes water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that Peter Tosh and Bob Marley,
all those rastas in the seventies,
[SPEAKER_02]: they said, we're meditating, meditation,
that's spirituality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's missing in today's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about how big the buds are,
how fast it's flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do you get per light?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the subtle nuances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those little steps make a big
difference when you ignore them along the
[SPEAKER_03]: way, compared to when you focus on them
along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's really the difference between
the people who are growing, I guess what
[SPEAKER_03]: the black market would call quads versus
the people that are growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the doubles, the dubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bad word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is there's so much of
that going around that the prices are
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping, but people that are still
growing quality are still getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people need to realize is
put the effort in and you'll get what you
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve for your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when people know what
you're growing, know the way you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you know, people ask for it by
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why the micro industry
is going to have such an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can bring a lot of those street
brands to the legal market, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's nothing more than we wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of why I've used my brand
and my name, which has kind of been
[SPEAKER_03]: synonymous with quality over the last 20
years, teaching people about quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: where I've always gravitated towards guys
like you that are also on the,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I kind of can give this sort of,
you know, full melt certification to
[SPEAKER_03]: certain groups of people that I know are
growing resin that can actually produce
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, melty hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing 10, 12 week strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing the regular eight week
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at trichrome development
before we're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, you know, we're not just
thinking at the next paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I need money like
everybody else, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want, you know, to do something of a
higher quality than the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air sign, harvesting, so you're guarding
by the moon like between like the
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild dynamics, wild groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, Nitsa's talking to us about it
and, you know, he's trying to spin a good
[SPEAKER_02]: vibe through his plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why when you smoke meal stuff,
I mean, butter, you don't have all this
[SPEAKER_02]: racy feeling because the cannabinoids had
time to express itself within the
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're separating and you're
consuming it, you have that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times I've smoked somebody else's
mother's milk in life?
[SPEAKER_02]: And fat, heart race, low blood sugar
drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even throbbing in my ankle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the heavy metals of the nutrients
or the lead in the water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the underdeveloped trichromes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, harvesting early,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pet hair in the garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the grower who's stressed and only
thinking about money?
[SPEAKER_02]: The intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely something to be said
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The LPs aren't really focused on that
right now, but I think it's the importance
[SPEAKER_03]: in having groups like you guys,
in a sense, become LPs or become micro
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and processors to sort of,
I think that'll be the missing link that
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll really be able to show these LPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're not doing everything
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing an incredibly clean crop is
important, but there's other little
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects that if you remove from the
process, you won't end up with the same
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great airflow in here you guys have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got a nice bit,
you said you had a five ton in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your can of filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got our can of filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the outtakes and on the intakes
because the municipality wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that whenever the power went out,
that the whole neighborhood didn't smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got licensed by our municipality to
do what we're doing here.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, they see that,
you know, we want to go ahead with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be part of the micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working with municipalities that
want to work with people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, want to bring this new business
to their town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's, uh, let's go check out
another room.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are in one of your,
I guess, cloning mother veg rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bedroom running under a CMH
ceramic metal highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're using three 15 double three 15,
but we're actually just using one at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: One per one per hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see one's turned off in each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try giving them both, but, uh,
use a lot less lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those lights very hot as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to do a flowering with
them probably soon enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of our next runs, um, just got
more that are coming in soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to change it up here in a
little bit in here in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the blindings, probably bring it to
LEDs because, uh, we really liked the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that the, uh, the LEDs have done the
bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, most likely going to change
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is basically our bedroom where we
keep our mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take our cuttings here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so right now we have a bunch of,
where's my bike, some piper, some
[SPEAKER_01]: headbanger and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few genetics that we're trying out in
the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have coffee and, uh, we did four
years around with just the trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still the testing phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our next round of,
uh, mother's milk that we have here going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all milk or there's some bikes too?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all labeled differently,
but there are all milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bad choice in labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't take them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I saw a couple of WMVs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a hundred milks, a hundred milks
where we'll take a 90 of the best ones to
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant to our flower groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where they start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on tables, nice and easy to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the much larger tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are five by 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two of these in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty easy to, uh, to work around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the handle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little steering wheel there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always just used the, my hip.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well let's go check out the final room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, uh, the led room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are in the led room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, John Neal's partner is here with us as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just going to talk a little bit
about the difference between, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the HPS and the led that they've seen so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, welcome to our led room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as you can see, it's doing quite well
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these are the panels we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 200 watt panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a mixed spectrum on this line
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a row of whites and then the
deep red and then the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is definitely the row that we're
preferring at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a row of all whites,
the one that you're seeing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are usually more used under,
uh, for vegging, but, uh, we did a test to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the flowering under them and we saw the
same type of results as you see under,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, metal highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't stretch as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bit shorter than the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other plants, but the bud structure is
a little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the test is really going to be on the
different, the terpene productions and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're going to be able to do all
the different tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have basically six tables here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three tables of where's my bike,
three tables of mother's milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're all growing under different
spectrums of leds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have a slightly
different result under each table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you tell us a little bit about the
company that you're working with,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you came, to put these led lights in
your room over other ones and what was
[SPEAKER_03]: really the turning point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a lot of, uh, it's a big
investment to do R and D for other
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we'd seen quite a few companies
go around and, um, I basically spoke to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, uh, the two engineers that
designed, uh, the lights and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: together and they were talking and what,
what they were telling was made a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were basically going to try to
replicate what, you know, a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb did with half the, the, the wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they said that they had found,
they said that the formula, the right
[SPEAKER_01]: formula to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they sound pretty convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them a try and right away,
you know, we saw great results from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw, like I was saying before,
the, the buds actually started developing
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit quicker, a day or two quicker
than I was used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the light transition from ceramic
metal highlights, to the led room was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no stress whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants were always happy and healthy
under the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like they can even almost grow into
the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see light stress, but you won't see
any temperature like, uh, affecting the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the trichromes or the pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll still stay white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is also that these
burn at about 45 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as opposed to 750 from a double ended
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge difference in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using a third DAC we would have
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, usually we'd use a five ton
AC in a room this size with 12,000 Watts
[SPEAKER_01]: of double ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're, we're using about two tons
max, a ton and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mother milk you guys have been
growing for not as long as the bike,
[SPEAKER_03]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we've had it for about the same amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just haven't really, uh, developed it
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, we've grown it a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't as popular as the bike,
so we didn't give it as much, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, uh, it's really got a nice
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super unique compared to a lot of
things that are out on the market right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got subtle nuances, whereas most
things are either based off of a cush
[SPEAKER_03]: profiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's got the density.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got really nice structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wonder, I guess when you're
doing R and D for a different light,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're used to HPS, what you're
really looking for is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, an increase in either your,
ideally both your resin and your
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative yield production.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bikes look huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, uh, you know, and, but normal
huge, I mean, this is usually like under
[SPEAKER_01]: the deep rest is more what you'd see under
an HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of the same characteristics
where you'll have those, those hollow
[SPEAKER_01]: stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see now at the end of flowering,
the plants are having a hard time holding
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're not as, as girthy as the,
the whites would be or the metal
[SPEAKER_01]: highlights would be, but the, the bud
structure is, is very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have some cool is in the back
there that are way bigger than your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so we're definitely seeing the
different traits from the different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of lightings that are very similar with
what we would find on the market or
[SPEAKER_01]: greater.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was, what was the name of this
led company again?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is era group at the moment or ERA
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're not out on the market at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be shortly, I believe on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few LPs that are also looking at
these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we're just basically waiting on
the numbers that are going to come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: this room to see the ground, the gram per
wattage that we're going to, we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get gram per wattage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the per square or the resin
yields afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our percentage, you know, the bike
we're used to getting a high 20s,
[SPEAKER_01]: high 20% yields and rosin and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're definitely going to like to see
if we can still maintain the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hugely valuable data, uh,
not only for the led companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for growers as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you can use half the ampage,
uh, if you can create less heat,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you can use less, um, air conditioning,
these are all just sustainable concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like all the stress that puts on
machinery, like you're, you're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting, you know, you're fighting heat
all the time in your double ended rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we've turned everything off in this
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in here talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not getting hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not getting a burn on our necks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the micro moles are very low compared
to, to what you'd see on W on double
[SPEAKER_01]: ended, you know, we're at three 80,
400.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're very low, but yet, you know,
we're getting great results.
[SPEAKER_03]: The resin production looks on point too,
to my naked eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten my macro lens under there
yet, but it definitely looks on point in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sense that the resin is growing up to
the teeth, uh, to the tips of the sugar
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves, some of the fan leaves themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're covered almost to the edges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother's milk is, is way like the
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan leaves are growing like full
visible trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the heads with the naked eye
trichome goodness and a wonderful aromatic
[SPEAKER_03]: smell in this room between these two
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, once again, you've got how many
lights total for how many Watts in this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular room?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, if we take one table,
we run five lights of 200 Watts under one,
[SPEAKER_01]: one table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're running a thousand Watts under a
four by eight table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have six of those in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have six of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're running 6,000 Watts in this room
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to the other room that runs at
12,000 12,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is your first grow with these
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you've got, I like how you've got
a whole row of the reds, a row of the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're also going to look,
so when we go for testing, we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: two, like six at the same time,
we're going to have six different like
[SPEAKER_01]: tables to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to send everything out to
get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the, the trichrome, not the
trichome, but the turkey productions on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on each light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also testing another light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a little UV that we're adding
only at the last four hours of the day for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last four weeks of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only trying it on one little section
for now, but we're developing a hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: model of light that will have like the UV
included inside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I just want to stick my face in
these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little mouth water and standing at
this level, seeing the size of these colas
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get in and photograph some of
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how I'm going to do it,
but I'll definitely figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: These lower buds will be no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones that are at the mixed spectrum,
the good definition of it, the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging on the end is the red that was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just developed really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, all in all, before you harvest,
before you make hash, just, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: your sort of intuitive feelings,
you guys are both pretty happy with what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, very impressed with the switch from,
uh, being HPS growers and then going into
[SPEAKER_00]: this led market where we're going to be a
little bit more conscious of the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we want to go to the
microwave like we've been saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really, we really do
believe that in the micro, it's all going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be about efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to be, have a very
small footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's all going to be about being
efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the amount of lights that
you've saved here, it's like, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: literally have panels on the side walls
and still be using less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what we're looking at adding
things like through the canopy and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having little lights that are mounted
on tripods that go in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopies and, uh, you know, without UVs
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, we're, we're looking at a bunch
of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, uh, have plenty of ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I really can't wait to get the macro
lens under here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you guys for walking us through
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, this, uh, maybe next up
will be a little macro photography and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do some, uh, nice closeup footage
with the video camera so people can really
[SPEAKER_03]: get an idea of what's going on in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You
[SPEAKER_03]: want to hit some foam out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt.
They
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't joking when they said the room is
really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lights are giving off very little heat
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the room has really well conditioned
air.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, for only using two tons of
a five ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got about six to eight fans in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh six.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the hugest room, but,
uh, they're definitely doing a good job in
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're growing great looking cannabis
so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously once I've helped make some hash
out of it and we've squished a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, that'll be the true test.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, overall I'm quite impressed with
this led room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, you know, the led lights look
somewhat dated, but, uh, to me looks mean
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing when it comes to the actual
production of the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're actually pulling off,
if they're focused on the engineering of
[SPEAKER_03]: the lights and the spectrum, that to me is
a lot more important than trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: something look fancy for a grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a great looking canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they've got the lights really
packed in nicely and obviously using a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: less ampage is, uh, going to be something
that growers are looking more forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to lower that heat,
make the room more comfortable to work in
[SPEAKER_03]: and be using, you know, less wattage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a win-win to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to get my macro lens out and
do some photography now and see,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, if we can't get some great resin
photos of the mother's milk as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: the, uh, whereas my bike's at flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're doing next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try, try, try, try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
Hey,
hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, uh, Stefan, uh, to pay for top
gardens group who has, uh, these guys have
[SPEAKER_03]: been the engineers behind the led lights
that the maple butter boys are growing in
[SPEAKER_03]: this R and D room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also got Neil from maple butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, thank you for being here today,
Stefan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, only had the last 24 hours
or so to sort of be, uh, in and around
[SPEAKER_03]: these lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to say, even just from turning
off all the fans and all the AC about 10
[SPEAKER_03]: or 15 minutes ago and kind of getting
caught up talking outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we came in, it was a real joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: To not just be smacked with that HPS heat
and, uh, lighting spectrum that tends to
[SPEAKER_03]: give me migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'll start with a quick
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, give us a little bit about your
background, a little bit about how you got
[SPEAKER_03]: into led lighting and, and maybe how it
translated into cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, again, thanks for having me and I
want to thank Neil and John for the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we, uh, my team that is have been,
uh, in the led lighting business for the
[SPEAKER_07]: better part of about 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we started off, uh, way back when we
called the white space and, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: that space has evolved dramatically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we say white space is general
lighting, uh, that space has evolved
[SPEAKER_07]: dramatically over that period of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we, uh, for all intended purpose
have been focusing our time and energy for
[SPEAKER_07]: the last eight years in the older culture
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what we brought to bear was,
uh, essentially what I call a
[SPEAKER_07]: collaboration between, um, experts in the
led business, uh, ourselves, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: universities, and also commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what we wanted to do is make sure that
we did not, uh, develop products sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: in a vacuum and ultimately take,
uh, feedback from people in multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: different, uh, industries in order to,
uh, uh, develop a product line of the
[SPEAKER_07]: older culture fixtures that, uh,
we, we think, uh, will deliver on the
[SPEAKER_07]: promise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we see here essentially
with the help of, uh, Neil and John,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, who have been growing under our led
lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we definitely see a first and the
results are very happy with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll certainly let Neil talk about
this, uh, his feedback or his,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, experience so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we've been in this for how many weeks
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're in the ninth week right now of
flowering and, uh, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: from day one, you know, it was definitely
a little bit of a leap of faith,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Stefan had the right points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we, we dropped the wattage
in the room drastically, uh, like a half
[SPEAKER_01]: what we would have usually had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we changed a little bit our ways
of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like upped our temperatures a little
bit and started playing a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: with the BPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we really started getting,
uh, you know, really nice results from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no, uh, stress from transition
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: From vegging to, uh, to flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, no, overall a really nice,
uh, great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the bikes look absolutely
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say that the mother milks don't,
but just from the perspective of these
[SPEAKER_03]: giant, you know, arm sized buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I years ago would have never thought
that that was possible under led lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm quite certain that, you know,
not too many years ago, you could have
[SPEAKER_03]: grown these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking the led lights out, put the HPSs
underneath and just told people,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, this is an HPS garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can't do this with led.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could literally trick people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buds are huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, obviously vegetative
yield is huge to all sorts of growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, uh, it's the resin content and
these things seem to be on point for how
[SPEAKER_03]: sticky they are, how much the room smells,
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profile is definitely a really nice cause
we have, we don't see any heat straining.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no heat stress on the plants
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these burn at 45 degrees Celsius,
I believe, uh, with no AC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, uh, literally there's no real
risk of, of, of damaging or crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with these, we were using a third the
AC capacity and a half the wattage in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's, it's, it's really a good,
great gain of, uh, efficiency in growing
[SPEAKER_01]: under these lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what were some of the key things to
find for the development of these
[SPEAKER_03]: particular lights, the shape and the
sizes, the strips, the lights use,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what, what were some key things that
led you to create this particular design
[SPEAKER_03]: with the white and the red?
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, we, we've been at this for,
for about eight years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that we,
we've been constantly looking at,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, as you pointed out is, uh,
you would have never thought this possible
[SPEAKER_07]: a few years back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And indeed it was not really possible
because the technology was not there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not ready for prime time,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's been a big evolution in the
led industry, especially for the culture
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of, uh, combining different types
of technologies and different colors for
[SPEAKER_07]: longevity, but also for light output.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially in the, uh, or culture
business in terms of micro-mo production
[SPEAKER_07]: for the plants that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we looked at that, we wanted to
take a different approach because again,
[SPEAKER_07]: through our experience and, and feedback
that we've received, um, typically under
[SPEAKER_07]: HBS, you have that one point source or one
light source that emits a lot of infrared
[SPEAKER_07]: energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of light essentially with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we wanted to have a more of a
distributed approach, more of a canopy
[SPEAKER_07]: approach, essentially giving the ability
as Neil pointed out that you could
[SPEAKER_07]: actually take your lights and bring them
down as close to as possible to the
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, our lights will go as low as,
you know, no, no space whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you let the plants grow into,
uh, into, uh, the lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the feedback that we've received
and through our own experience also over
[SPEAKER_07]: time is we understood one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go back in time with, uh,
in the white space, moving parts or
[SPEAKER_07]: mechanical parts was essentially looked at
a, uh, looked at or pawn as a failure
[SPEAKER_07]: mechanism over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why what you see with these
lights, the rugged, uh, that was the
[SPEAKER_07]: intent for growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're waterproof.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no fans.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, as Neil pointed out is over
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: These lights will not go very high in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've been designed that way to
maintain a certain level of temperatures
[SPEAKER_07]: that in this space, you feel very
comfortable, very well in working under
[SPEAKER_07]: the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the other thing too is we took
percussion in terms of our IP in the
[SPEAKER_07]: distributed fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you asked about the two different,
um, uh, products that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one that's called super grow,
which is more of this white, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: whitish with a very special spectrum
distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other one is more of a distributed
with a little bit more red or what we call
[SPEAKER_07]: deep red, which facilitates growth from,
from, uh, experiences and also tests that
[SPEAKER_07]: we've, we've ran.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also in the process of introducing
these are 200 Watts, uh, fixtures and
[SPEAKER_07]: people sometimes a surprise saying,
well, 200 Watts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a combination.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to replace a thousand watt,
you'll go with 600 Watts, essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, there's economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that here, we went 500
correct, but we're going to go a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more under the new hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as Neil pointed out, we have a hybrid
model, uh, that's going to be released
[SPEAKER_07]: here very shortly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a combination of both from a special
distribution, but also at in the,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the wattage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're moving from 200 to 300 Watts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the idea is that you combine two,
which essentially becomes a four by four
[SPEAKER_07]: grid, essentially to replace a thousand
Watts, uh, give or take.
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you tell us a little bit about the
differences between the plastics that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, shielding both the white and the red?
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed one is opaque and one is clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's very good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the one that's clear, it's because of
the spectral distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because it's all white of the same
color, recipe, so to speak, you don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: to necessarily diffuse the light because
the light that's submitted is uniform
[SPEAKER_07]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the other one, if we'd open it up,
you'd see that we have different LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are white, some are red.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order not to have what we call
shadow on the plan because of the two
[SPEAKER_07]: LEDs, we've designed a diffuser that
diffuses the light spectrum completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So give you a very uniform across the
entire fixture, a uniform light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's holding it pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not, I'm not completely
understanding all the science behind
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked into it a little bit over the
years from metal highlight to HPS to LED,
[SPEAKER_03]: but obviously there's a substantial
difference between the red and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and the white.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and what you would see, again,
if you go back to HPS, there's different
[SPEAKER_07]: spikes.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the light distribution or
spectral distribution, there are certain
[SPEAKER_07]: spikes of what we call light emitting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So essentially the, the, the frequency at
which, you know, different colors are
[SPEAKER_07]: being emitted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, in this case, what we wanted to do is
ensure again, um, that we have a uniform
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution and a spectral distribution
that, um, provides either more deep red in
[SPEAKER_07]: the case of the, uh, uh, fixture,
what we call the mega bloom and a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit less in this case of the super grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it all depends on the grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we keep on saying that we would never
do this without the growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously the growers know how to grow
their crop very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here to facilitate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here to help, uh, in a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the, these growers know how to grow
their crops really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to photograph a lot of different
grows and do videos and a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's really, really well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the way they've taken, you know,
almost, I mean, obviously it's ACNPR it's
[SPEAKER_03]: legal, but it's also, I still use the term
where you've kind of go, you're going from
[SPEAKER_03]: that black market to that legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys have done an incredible
jump in producing like a really
[SPEAKER_03]: professional room.
[SPEAKER_03]: For you to be able to hang these,
uh, these LED lights in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing, I have to say,
to watch both of you stand under the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights, like less than six inches and not
be sweating and hot and uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would not be possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the point I want to make is we,
again, we definitely want to thank Neil
[SPEAKER_07]: and John because we've done a number of
these installations so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, we always typically put them at
the top of the list of what we call
[SPEAKER_07]: attention to details and, and what Neil
mentioned, before is there's a little
[SPEAKER_07]: paradigm shift when you go from HPS to
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's critical for people to
understand is that you need to monitor,
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously the environment and growers know
that, but you need to do it differently
[SPEAKER_07]: under LEDs to some extent, increase the
temperature, manage humidity a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it results there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, especially because when you have
someone like Neil and John able to show
[SPEAKER_03]: the proof of concept of the lights,
then when people fail themselves and blame
[SPEAKER_03]: the lights, you're able to say,
well, we know that this is, is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and most people, it's very much a
human trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do it with my product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I, you know, I made some bubble and I
put it in the bags and it just didn't come
[SPEAKER_03]: out nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, that's not the bags
fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the grower who did that
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the proof of concept to be able
to show, you know, the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really, I mean, these are some
serious nuggets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the, the bikes look to me like
an old school, late eighties, early
[SPEAKER_03]: nineties, cannabis cultivar, just the
formation of the buds, this big and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got over here, the sort of newer
sort of calyx stacked Fox tail mother's
[SPEAKER_03]: milk, which is just a, I mean,
they both look exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and they're going to have weight,
you know, they're dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing with, with LEDs,
you know, is, is you'll get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, it looks like it's big, but then
when you dry them, you don't get that
[SPEAKER_01]: dense weight where these definitely look
dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to stake everything falling and
no, it was a, it's a nice, it's a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's the future for ERA lighting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys looking to fill up some LPs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you looking to do like additional
lighting in greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what all of the above, I would say at
this point in time, we have a number of
[SPEAKER_07]: installations on their way.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea was all along to prove a point,
which is, as you pointed out, this works.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of bad press in the
industry about LEDs and that the market is
[SPEAKER_07]: very open right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's multiple different entrance,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's going to allow the industry
to evolve.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we wanted to do is very, we're very
close and we want to continue that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very closely with growers because
they know how to grow their plants best.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, like I said, we're here to
facilitate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next steps really are working with
LPs.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a big push for micro LPs in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a presence both in Canada and
the U S and we're, we have big plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah, it's absolutely impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you guys have done here altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lights look great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the way they really create a full
canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no real breaks or spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lights just fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the efficiency also comes in,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every square inch is full,
is really filled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you get your efficiency,
you know, having a small high powered
[SPEAKER_01]: unit, you know, has to dissipate not as
pen food, not as good as a job as this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just as important for the small time
growers as it is for the large time
[SPEAKER_03]: grower, obviously for the small time
grower who doesn't have a lot of room and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of space and air circulation is
always a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to bring the temperature down
this much is very substantial,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, using half the wattage,
using half the AC, reducing your footprint
[SPEAKER_03]: by such a large amount is, is it's a game
changer really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm really looking like I'm going
to have an equal, equal crop as I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have under HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you said that because this
will definitely be a two part video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how we'll do the second part,
but I definitely want to get the numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: from you in respect to the vegetative
yields versus the normal vegetative yields
[SPEAKER_03]: grown under HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, from the bubble man's
perspective, most importantly,
[SPEAKER_03]: the resin content, the cannabinoid and
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great that it's two cultivars that
you've been growing for some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bike is tried and true.
[SPEAKER_03]: When done properly, you know, the bike can
produce 20 percent plus returns on,
[SPEAKER_03]: on rosin and other oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hit up to 32.7 on the friend of ours
on the HO.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it'll be great to see that we'll do
a second part video, even if I have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys filming some squishes and maybe
some water hash making, we definitely want
[SPEAKER_03]: to show the resin content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I'll be photographing the
grow still with my macro lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during this video, you guys will also
be seeing what the resin looks like grown
[SPEAKER_03]: under these LED lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just a pleasure to be in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, Stefan, for sharing some
time with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely think that in the future,
it would be great to do a hash church
[SPEAKER_03]: episode on maybe the future of growing,
where we get the tissue culture guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we get the LED light guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys come in, have John and Neil
come in, the growers have some extractors
[SPEAKER_03]: come in and just talk about this from all
the different perspectives of growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think I think it's it's a big
game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've obviously we've all been hearing
about LED lights for a long time and
[SPEAKER_03]: people have been, you know, just as
excited as I am now five years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The results weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this to me looks like the results are
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the medicine.
The medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the medicine.
