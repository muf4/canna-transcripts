[SPEAKER_07]: all right look at that boom boom boom
welcome everybody by everybody it's
[SPEAKER_07]: probably a small group as today is a very
spur-of-the-moment last-minute hash church
[SPEAKER_07]: episode 16 of hash church 2.0 I'm pretty
darn excited to be here I'm not gonna lie
[SPEAKER_07]: let me just close this down real quick
turn that off boom boom boom I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: send out the link to the few people and by
few people I mean very few people that
[SPEAKER_07]: have said they're gonna come in today I am
sending the link out to a lot more than
[SPEAKER_07]: four but I kind of got about four or five
people that said yeah yeah yeah we can we
[SPEAKER_07]: can do it so very excited to just to see
you guys all it's been it's been a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit of time since we've last gotten
together and it's been incredible how much
[SPEAKER_07]: news has occurred in the cannabis world
community since the last hash church and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's really what kind of got me this
morning as I woke up a little bit earlier
[SPEAKER_07]: than usual and had some extra time I
thought man it'd be nice to just hear from
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple of people I wanted to hear from
that yeah he's on a cruise ship with
[SPEAKER_07]: shitty internet so we won't be hearing
from him but there's fucking Johnny B
[SPEAKER_10]: what's up guys dude how are you doing
brother fantastic it's minus like 40
[SPEAKER_10]: outside it's ridiculous oh my god I know
good old Edmonton good old Edmonton I just
[SPEAKER_10]: had to cut my hash right at the window
it's perfect really like it's so cold I
[SPEAKER_10]: put it on the on the counter right here
and it was like buttering up so I just put
[SPEAKER_10]: it right on the windowsill and my pipe
like literally is like so cold too like
[SPEAKER_10]: everything is just like it was perfect I
wish I could make some sift in the
[SPEAKER_07]: bathroom here at the hotel beautiful well
good to see your smiling face brother it's
[SPEAKER_07]: been it's been a while since we did a hash
church hasn't it you know what everybody's
[SPEAKER_10]: busy and it's like wow I'm just here in
Edmonton and it's like there's an event
[SPEAKER_10]: next weekend you've been flying out people
this industry is moving so quickly like
[SPEAKER_10]: shit since October when was the last time
we did you know what surprisingly I guess
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't done many videos on my YouTube
channel period so when I went back it was
[SPEAKER_07]: only like six videos back but it was the
one with Alex Rogers from the promoting
[SPEAKER_07]: the ICBC that we were gonna be doing in
Spain on March 14th in Barcelona are you
[SPEAKER_07]: coming to Barcelona um I can't make it
this year oh shit well that's okay brother
[SPEAKER_07]: you're fun you're flying all over the
place all the time so you can only make I
[SPEAKER_09]: mean I've been slowing down on the fly
lately yeah you'd be flying all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: place yeah I went and flew to Calgary
recently and met with this brewery that
[SPEAKER_07]: has an interest in cannabinoids and
terpened infused beverages so that was
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of fun I went there with my team at
embark I don't even know how many people
[SPEAKER_07]: even know about embark to be honest I have
I talked about embark much my latest
[SPEAKER_10]: project I don't think you've actually
really talked about it at all I mean
[SPEAKER_10]: people in the industry like ourselves and
your friends know what's going on and what
[SPEAKER_10]: you're doing but really no one knows
what's going on with embark what what
[SPEAKER_10]: we've talked about over the years and and
and where you're going with what you're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing I think it's fantastic I'm so stoked
and proud of what what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry and what you're doing with the
industry you got to tell people what's
[SPEAKER_07]: going on yeah yeah for sure well I've got
Mike West coming in here later so he'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to to talk about a little bit about
that as well but yeah embark has been
[SPEAKER_07]: moving forward of course this is a new
company that I've helped found just in the
[SPEAKER_07]: last six to seven months actually and got
great team of people super stoked on them
[SPEAKER_07]: really professional and high caliber which
I've truly it's my first time experiencing
[SPEAKER_07]: in the in the cannabis industry working
with a team of this caliber and so we're
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty excited about it obviously it's an
extraction lab we've got a facility here
[SPEAKER_07]: in Delta BC that we're going to be doing
40,000 square feet of extraction and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: it when I say extraction it's not just
bubble man extraction it's much bigger
[SPEAKER_07]: than me obviously I'm very focused on
solvent-less extraction I love the rosin I
[SPEAKER_07]: love the full mount water hash I love the
what did I say full mount water hash Jesus
[SPEAKER_07]: oh god damn that smells good when I get
back but also dry sift and you know that
[SPEAKER_07]: the solvent-less processes but then at the
same time we've got we've got a great team
[SPEAKER_07]: including Mike West who's really going to
be focused on the CO2 the hydrocarbon the
[SPEAKER_07]: cryo ethanol which my partner Anthony from
Colorado will be will be actively involved
[SPEAKER_07]: in so we're really putting this this
really cool team together kind of before
[SPEAKER_07]: the laws are even really allowing it so
we've done a lot of due diligence in the
[SPEAKER_07]: last six months we're funded for phase one
we're simultaneously actually while we're
[SPEAKER_07]: building out the building that already
exists so it's a rebuild kind of you know
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just going to be doing you know
building specific things in each room that
[SPEAKER_07]: already exists simultaneously we've now
taken on a project in Woodstock Ontario
[SPEAKER_07]: where we're actually going to build it up
from the ground up so this this could be
[SPEAKER_07]: 40,000 50,000 60,000 upwards of 80,000
square feet of extraction it's going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting on three acres that our partners
already own and it's going to have some
[SPEAKER_07]: serious capabilities if embark in Delta
can do 3.6 to 4 million pounds per year of
[SPEAKER_07]: processing we're hoping on getting double
that out of the Woodstock facility so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: it's something very serious when you're
talking millions of pounds of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: being being extracted into traditional
hashes into oh there's Mike now what's
[SPEAKER_04]: going on brother good morning Johnny how
are you guys I was just talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: embark and breaking down all the different
types of processes that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: rocking on and the facility in Woodstock
and the facility in Delta and was talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about you in regards to kind of you know
being in charge of our co2 and our
[SPEAKER_07]: hydrocarbon division and helping with our
cryo ethanol and post-production of
[SPEAKER_07]: isolates and boom you came right in we're
just talking about dreams we've been
[SPEAKER_10]: talking about for years it's happening
it's cool yeah I mean yeah it's funny
[SPEAKER_07]: because hash church really hey Sabo how's
it going brother hey good morning good
[SPEAKER_07]: morning how's everyone doing dude as a
father of three I appreciate you taking
[SPEAKER_07]: time out from your family even if it's 20
minutes we really do appreciate it that
[SPEAKER_07]: you came by and hung out on a hash church
with us hey you know it you know it hey
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a good morning out here I wanted to
see some old friends consume some cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: before taking the kids to go swimming and
here we are dude you are an inspiration to
[SPEAKER_07]: me one of the I mean in many ways of
course all of you guys are but the one way
[SPEAKER_07]: that you really inspire me is that you and
I've kind of not jealous not envious
[SPEAKER_07]: inspired by the conversation that you
started about parenting kids and cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an extremely mature topic
that you've that you've taken on and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: just a topic that more and more people
parents of kids who are cannabis users
[SPEAKER_07]: whether recreational whether preventative
whether medicinal I think it's an
[SPEAKER_07]: important conversation to have and I'm
definitely wanting to plan a hash church
[SPEAKER_07]: in the future when you have more time to
get into that conversation because I've
[SPEAKER_07]: watched you have it with a multitude of
people now and it's it's time is now for
[SPEAKER_07]: that conversation brother so hats off to
you thank you if I was wearing a hat I
[SPEAKER_06]: would take it off myself and you know I
felt like it was just one of the last
[SPEAKER_06]: places or not one of the last places but
you know it was something that I could
[SPEAKER_06]: speak from my own true experience with it
and you know having kids that are right
[SPEAKER_06]: now four and eight years old and just
going to elementary school and dealing
[SPEAKER_06]: with the PPA and other parents you know
what I realized is there was just so much
[SPEAKER_06]: misinformation out there and this was
really an opportunity to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: educate people and you know it's not like
I was cramming it down the throat they
[SPEAKER_06]: were just looking for new information on
cannabis the different ways that we could
[SPEAKER_06]: utilize it and what's the best way to talk
about it with our children it's super
[SPEAKER_07]: important and you just nailed it right
there that's where the conversation starts
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's two ways as a father to go
through this there's the way of this
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation makes my wife very
uncomfortable so I'm just going to avoid
[SPEAKER_07]: it completely or I'm gonna talk about this
I'm gonna let people know that I'm not
[SPEAKER_07]: their worry I'm not a worry for them I'm
not trying to take their young kids behind
[SPEAKER_07]: the school and get them high this is like
you know this is a different thing
[SPEAKER_07]: completely and and and I think that it's
as important for a recreational user as it
[SPEAKER_07]: is for a medicinal user of course in the
last 15 to 20 years we've given a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of you know we've accepted medical
users more than we've accepted
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational users you know it's like oh
okay it's a medicine okay well then you
[SPEAKER_07]: know that's different but we're getting to
a point now where it's like well you know
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is a preventative medicine which
really makes recreational use preventative
[SPEAKER_07]: and so there's also a value in using it
recreational and preventatively one does
[SPEAKER_07]: not have to wait to get sick one does not
have to wait to be endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_07]: deficient before kind of taking taking you
know taking responsibility into your own
[SPEAKER_07]: hands so I just think it's a great
conversation and I'm definitely super
[SPEAKER_07]: stoked to get into it more maybe we could
have a panel of all parents you know when
[SPEAKER_07]: we have that conversation and just really
go deep into and I'm sure if we had you
[SPEAKER_07]: know a variety of parents as well from the
super deeply like full-blown you know like
[SPEAKER_07]: earth mother regenerative farming like
organics right up to the professional you
[SPEAKER_07]: know you know person that has a career
person that has you know that's not in
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis whatsoever but how did how did
those two people perceive differently
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe and just you know get into the
conversation because it is very important
[SPEAKER_07]: side note shout out to Lost Gardens for
the absolute fire fire melt this is some
[SPEAKER_07]: 5.5 to 6 star and I just had to say thank
you to Sean from Lost Gardens you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: puffing on today oh I muted you Mike I
muted everyone when Sabo was talking so I
[SPEAKER_07]: see what you're showing I just don't hear
what you're showing what's going on phbn
[SPEAKER_07]: nice group of people in the chat room
right now usually it shows me how many
[SPEAKER_07]: people are in the chat room but I can't
actually see that right now yeah that's so
[SPEAKER_07]: strange usually it'll it'll show us like
us there's a certain amount of people in
[SPEAKER_07]: the room oh there's 277 people watching
well that's not too shabby that's a decent
[SPEAKER_10]: amount of folks watching so I got some
really nice stuff here called slime for
[SPEAKER_10]: that I just got hooked up with you and I'm
coming back to smoke this with you because
[SPEAKER_10]: this is some epic rosin did that come from
Saskatchewan yes it did I know where that
[SPEAKER_10]: came from exactly how do you like my
skills Johnny B I already knew that's why
[SPEAKER_10]: I pulled it I was like wait a second here
I because this is for us to smoke and I
[SPEAKER_07]: already know listen the only reason I know
that that's from Saskatchewan cuz you have
[SPEAKER_07]: the same little container don't you
[SPEAKER_07]: so I have hundreds of these containers but
only one guy sends them with parchment in
[SPEAKER_07]: the lid shout out to this guy too man
there's mine mine was full melt hash not
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin yeah but I got some for you I clean
that up it still smells like grape I got
[SPEAKER_10]: some wedding cake and 90 you for you that
he gave me to give to you so we can puff
[SPEAKER_07]: down by the way sitting at my house
wonderful man I love this community I got
[SPEAKER_10]: waiting to like hook it up because we
haven't been able to see each other you
[SPEAKER_07]: know what I mean so yeah well that's
that's what happens right I feel bad flab
[SPEAKER_07]: 421 who's always been the most kind and
generous friend he's he'll get something
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful and he'll want to share it with
me and then we won't see each other for
[SPEAKER_07]: like two months and I'll see him and I'll
be like please tell me you don't still
[SPEAKER_07]: have that and he'll pull it out and be
like of course I have it brother we save
[SPEAKER_10]: it we're smoking this and I have that hash
too and you know so that's the best part
[SPEAKER_10]: of what we do in this industry and the
people the community is we do we save that
[SPEAKER_10]: epic and even even my girl says you know
we smoke the swag at home but you take the
[SPEAKER_10]: epic buds and you give them away to your
friends but that's we want to show our
[SPEAKER_10]: epic we want to show our best and we take
our best with us wherever we go and the
[SPEAKER_10]: first thing we want to do is like here
check this out man beautiful hey I want to
[SPEAKER_07]: hear from sable one last time because I
know he has to bounce really soon can you
[SPEAKER_07]: tell us a little bit about your new
product your new vaporizer the hanu labs
[SPEAKER_06]: oh yeah absolutely absolutely thank you
and did I sent some uh hardware up your
[SPEAKER_06]: way has it arrived yet marcus oh okay
sorry so rude of me to ask you a question
[SPEAKER_06]: while you were taking a dab so this is
basically our new device it's the hanu
[SPEAKER_06]: hanu stone vape exhale is still in
existence it's just I guess it's growing
[SPEAKER_06]: up it's going through puberty and hanu
labs and essentially what we wanted to do
[SPEAKER_06]: was we started off with the desktop
vaporizer to learn the science and physics
[SPEAKER_06]: behind vaporization and sublimating the
cannabinoid from a solid into a gas and
[SPEAKER_06]: then we wanted to apply it into a very
easy to use portable and this is the
[SPEAKER_06]: device it actually is all magnetic base
and we have a red congo oil in here right
[SPEAKER_06]: now red congo is a great lan ray sativa
strain I consumed it right before I
[SPEAKER_06]: competed in jiu-jitsu tournament yesterday
nice little shiner and got neat in the
[SPEAKER_06]: face and well this is why 42 year olds
don't compete with 22 year olds but
[SPEAKER_06]: luckily I'm okay I'm still lying in bed my
kids actually just brought me breakfast
[SPEAKER_06]: thank you so much because they know daddy
can't move today so I am very much
[SPEAKER_06]: utilizing this as a recovery tool but
essentially this was I had a really cool
[SPEAKER_06]: tactile sensation in your hand so that if
you couldn't consume it you could still
[SPEAKER_06]: rub it like a worry stone and maybe just
relieve some anxiety without even having
[SPEAKER_06]: to consume it and we also made it
asymmetrical in shape you know I live in
[SPEAKER_06]: San Francisco which is the home of
technology and even here I think we're
[SPEAKER_06]: sick of technology people are meditating
more camping more hiking more so we just
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted something that would be
asymmetrical that would remind someone of
[SPEAKER_06]: the imperfections of nature or maybe the
perfect imperfections of nature and the
[SPEAKER_06]: last thing was to really make sure that it
didn't just look cool and feel good but
[SPEAKER_06]: that when you put it to your mouth and you
inhaled it those would supersede the first
[SPEAKER_06]: two user experiences and we all know how
much you know effort the extractors put
[SPEAKER_06]: into creating all the oils today the live
rosin the shatters the the diamonds the
[SPEAKER_06]: sauces so what we did was when we created
all our own version of our atomizer most
[SPEAKER_06]: of the atomizers you know are really small
and the oil will sit on top of like the
[SPEAKER_06]: ceramic disc or the nichrome wire and what
we ended up doing was creating what we
[SPEAKER_06]: call a ceramic sponge so just like sponges
have nooks and crannies to absorb more
[SPEAKER_06]: water by having all these nooks and
crannies and the porous ceramic we have
[SPEAKER_06]: roughly three times the surface area as
your traditional vape pen which allows us
[SPEAKER_06]: to use lower temperatures to give you
better flavor and larger clouds so
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully we hit the mark but hopefully
you get yours in a few days and you can
[SPEAKER_07]: let me know if we hit the mark oh i
already know you hit the mark bro trust me
[SPEAKER_07]: on that one i know because i've been
anxiously at first when you're like oh i'm
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna send you one of these i was like
okay whatever that's cool and then as i
[SPEAKER_07]: started seeing people's experiences with
them i was kind of like wow like i really
[SPEAKER_07]: need to get one of those like this is
crazy and then it got worse and worse and
[SPEAKER_07]: worse to the point where now my mouth
waters when i see it so i just at least
[SPEAKER_07]: have to try it and you know for me there
is a lot in what you said at the towards
[SPEAKER_07]: the end by the way welcome to colin over
on the east coast i don't know if he's in
[SPEAKER_07]: new york or massachusetts what's up colin
what up guys what i was gonna say was and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a big long conversation and we've had
a little bit of that conversation before
[SPEAKER_07]: for me there is a real difference in the
preservation of terpene profiles through
[SPEAKER_07]: any type of vaporizer or dab rig and that
almost always is in regards to how the
[SPEAKER_07]: material that you're hitting off of holds
and releases heat and so that's why
[SPEAKER_07]: sapphire doesn't taste the same as quartz
and quartz doesn't say taste the same as
[SPEAKER_07]: titanium all when you do them all at the
exact same temperature which i've done
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't taste the same with the exact
same material and i was actually hitting a
[SPEAKER_07]: vaporizer the other drip the other day and
i don't think i have it here it was it was
[SPEAKER_07]: very much like uh gary's uh from uh from
uh oh shit with this the omicron is
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about the torch yeah yeah but i
was actually pleasantly surprised at how
[SPEAKER_07]: much that preserved the taste because i've
been dabbing off of um i think i'm hitting
[SPEAKER_07]: silicon carbide right now um and i've been
dabbing off of it for about a week to two
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks this hash and i ended up putting a
little bit in that torch and i was just
[SPEAKER_07]: very surprised at how different the tastes
were and i think that that's something
[SPEAKER_07]: that you know vaporization companies
should focus on much the same way when i
[SPEAKER_07]: spoke with terimo years ago about his
nutrient company that he was thinking of
[SPEAKER_07]: starting was to focus on the productions
of the phenols and the hydrocarbons within
[SPEAKER_07]: the trichome head like if you want to
manipulate something with your food learn
[SPEAKER_07]: to manipulate the actual production of the
building blocks of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes versus the mechanisms that
produce and create more vegetative yields
[SPEAKER_07]: of plant matter and so i see vaporizers
and and food like that's the focus if you
[SPEAKER_07]: have a food company in my opinion you know
like figure out a way to produce more
[SPEAKER_07]: medicinal components you know of a higher
quality of a higher expression vaporized
[SPEAKER_07]: companies vaporization companies is to
preserve the profile so when you when you
[SPEAKER_07]: hit it the taste is just so good and i i
i'd hate to say it because i love dab rigs
[SPEAKER_07]: but i think the nicest tasting hits that
i've had come from handheld vaporizers for
[SPEAKER_07]: preservation of taste but yeah i mean i
prefer yeah i believe that too mark and
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm really because of of just the way it
heats and i and as you talk about that
[SPEAKER_10]: because i've been doing a lot of dabbing
with the torch and then before i was on
[SPEAKER_10]: the email and use the pens a lot and as
you're talking about that the pens give it
[SPEAKER_10]: that nice smooth i like the taste here
it's right on par yeah absolutely yeah i
[SPEAKER_03]: i'll agree i i was using the the torch
yesterday and the omnicron as well and um
[SPEAKER_03]: you know they just give you a different
flavor profile altogether but the the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that i've been talking to a lot of
manufacturers about is the the reheating
[SPEAKER_03]: and the the heating of of you know oils in
a in a half gram to a gram um it's you
[SPEAKER_03]: know that heating and reheating really
causes you know a lot of strain on on the
[SPEAKER_03]: material and and over time um so when we
get you know you get a nice little dab in
[SPEAKER_03]: there on the torch or the omnicron it's
just unbelievably great you know so um if
[SPEAKER_03]: we can get closer to that with having oil
let's say we take solvent less and we put
[SPEAKER_03]: it into a cart it's that heating and
reheating and that material that same
[SPEAKER_03]: material staying in that element that
really causes it to degrade and really
[SPEAKER_03]: lose its its its flavor profile you just
don't have you don't get that with the
[SPEAKER_07]: omnicron dude that that leads me to my
vape exhale which is the only unit i have
[SPEAKER_07]: ever been able to take pure terpene rips
out of without it just being horribly
[SPEAKER_07]: destructive on my throat there's no other
unit that i've ever been able to hit pure
[SPEAKER_07]: turps off of like that one i mean i did a
whole fucking terpene gauntlet i can't
[SPEAKER_07]: remember who i did it with maybe brett
from uh you were there too sable we did
[SPEAKER_06]: one we did one as well i think we did like
a nine terpene gauntlet okay because i
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely have a 14 as well and it might
have even been deformed 420k i can't
[SPEAKER_07]: remember but that's that's that's saying a
lot and that is i always mix the two up
[SPEAKER_06]: convection conduction yeah induction
induction yeah and you know i i've i've
[SPEAKER_06]: always been a fan of convection over
conduction but as time has gone on you
[SPEAKER_06]: know i i've seen that there it's how you
execute the methodology that matters most
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know i played around with so many
different temperature types so many
[SPEAKER_06]: different surface areas you know one thing
that i was
[SPEAKER_10]: different kinds that you could find and
ultimately you know you'll arrive at stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm talking about terpenes and inside of
containers because of the way they're
[SPEAKER_10]: pre-packaging here in canada with
containers and stuff like that and looking
[SPEAKER_10]: at active water content and terpenes and
how they're in containers and looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: their moisture content sure that's
something we focus on heavily is trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: retain all that moisture content because
once that's lost your terpenes go with it
[SPEAKER_10]: man let me see i mean i would like to do a
um hash church on this mark uh about
[SPEAKER_10]: moisture content active water content and
relative humidity because it's quite a
[SPEAKER_10]: thing and fascinating that i've been
researching for the last little bit and
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a lot to talk about and i don't
have time today because i got to catch a
[SPEAKER_10]: plane and i like to kind of get deep into
it about it but there's there's all these
[SPEAKER_10]: little factors with legalization we're
looking at and how they're actually
[SPEAKER_10]: distributing uh all of this right now you
know what i mean like it's yeah i've been
[SPEAKER_10]: watching your posts yeah i'm testing stuff
at like 29 active water now active water
[SPEAKER_10]: content and bread crumbs is 30 pasta is 50
so there's got to be a standard there's
[SPEAKER_10]: more i want to talk about so i'm just kind
of kind of like this right it also well
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes back to the man you like now
we're talking about like gmp stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing right and we're like as
artists and as as cultivators you um you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of uh you know we have all these new
steps we have to pay attention to because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not just going in the packs and then
being quickly sold it's now being you know
[SPEAKER_03]: the packages are now going to be
individuals into grams eighths halves and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot one month three months six
months when it was packaged all this
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly it's totally man it's totally
different ball game so we've got to really
[SPEAKER_07]: think about it like that yeah damn did we
ever complexify this shit remember i got a
[SPEAKER_07]: bag of weed you need a bag of weed here
take this bag of weed yeah you know but
[SPEAKER_03]: wow it's something that is dear to my
heart because i want to make sure that as
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what we see behind the scenes is
not what most people see when they go to
[SPEAKER_03]: the dispensary um they they see a very
different experience and i you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: getting closer to that experience that we
are so fond of and making sure that that
[SPEAKER_03]: quality is upheld all the way through to
the first time they open it you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's major you know it's partly why for
instance here look this is induction
[SPEAKER_03]: sealed here and this is something i've
been playing with for months um for rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's really important to me is
because when these things get packed you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a lot of people are disappointed in
rosin because it's it gets to them all
[SPEAKER_03]: caked out and dry and not what they want
hey guys i don't mean to interrupt but i
[SPEAKER_06]: gotta go take my kids i just wanted to say
one last thing i'm big fans of everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: here medtainer is my favorite way to bring
all my flour around and thank you for
[SPEAKER_06]: doing what you're doing with that ceiling
because that last thing you said i've
[SPEAKER_06]: heard so many people say that about their
rosin and i'm so glad you came up with
[SPEAKER_06]: that i just wanted to make sure i got that
out before i left peace man appreciate
[SPEAKER_07]: that man we love you thanks save oh always
go ahead johnny i said what you just
[SPEAKER_10]: talked about seals and stuff like that was
the biggest thing is the type of seals and
[SPEAKER_10]: all these containers and how the ceiling
was all across the board and i've bought
[SPEAKER_10]: every lp cube that i can actually purchase
spent a couple thousand just to look at
[SPEAKER_10]: containers and packaging not even smoking
it i really needed to know what they're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing and it's and this is a big big part
that we're talking about is actually is
[SPEAKER_10]: these lids and these seals and and how
they're actually shipping this stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: how dry it is and yeah it's yeah i mean
all the lps out there listening you're
[SPEAKER_10]: welcome he's like hey what are you guys
doing i'm like you guys act of water is
[SPEAKER_10]: like pathetic man like come on like what
are you guys doing and and they're just
[SPEAKER_10]: not getting it and health canada has to
get involved too and they are down in the
[SPEAKER_10]: united states there's some more stuff we
want to talk about what they're doing in
[SPEAKER_10]: the united states and in canada health
canada was in meetings a couple months ago
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're starting to set a standard
between 55 to 65 act of water what i'm
[SPEAKER_10]: hearing we're finally gonna get standard
at some point right across the board
[SPEAKER_10]: because when we start controlling that
you're gonna start controlling terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: everything yeah listen if there's anything
you need you know you want to bounce ideas
[SPEAKER_03]: off of you know reach out to marcus and
you know so you know what it's just like
[SPEAKER_10]: this this next step for for yeah yeah
moisture content's huge you know all of
[SPEAKER_03]: our material really relies on that and you
know like you're kind of pointing out we
[SPEAKER_03]: you know we're industrializing an
ornamental crop and it really is something
[SPEAKER_10]: they look at act of water and you know
what i mean so it's really that a a w that
[SPEAKER_10]: we got to really start paying attention to
and did you want to explain the
[SPEAKER_07]: differences to everyone or did you already
i'm pretty no i haven't um i was going to
[SPEAKER_10]: talk more about that but relative humidity
in the air act of water is what's inside
[SPEAKER_10]: of a container so if there's a certain
amount of water or moisture content inside
[SPEAKER_10]: of a bud once you see what the act of
water is how it rehydrates and goes back
[SPEAKER_10]: and forth and there's certain steps of
where it's got to be it can't be above
[SPEAKER_10]: like 30 moisture content that's gonna be
above 65 relative humidity which will
[SPEAKER_10]: cause mold which act of water content
comes into play and i've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: testing that's why i want to talk more
about it like you know i'm learning i'm
[SPEAKER_10]: learning with other people are teaching me
this because i really want to know and
[SPEAKER_10]: they know that i have a voice that we're
using in order to educate everybody on
[SPEAKER_10]: this so i love to bounce more ideas off of
some people and really bring this to light
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk more about it yeah so let me ask
you so in terms of um testing you know has
[SPEAKER_03]: there been any um any long-term tests put
together um that kind of outline the
[SPEAKER_03]: relative humidity and microbes that are
that or really be active well lita has
[SPEAKER_10]: done a lot of heavy research on this those
are the those are the people i'm working
[SPEAKER_10]: with and um they're the ones that really
got a lot of deep research that they're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing with their company i'm doing my own
little stuff you know just finding
[SPEAKER_10]: research or finding what's going on with
it talking more about it and that's why i
[SPEAKER_10]: want to bring it to light because i need
to learn more i know my little port here
[SPEAKER_10]: you know what i mean and yep let's just
kind of let's educate keep it going yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: try to keep learning from each other yeah
i mean there's right and that's that's
[SPEAKER_03]: part of why we've been exploring induction
sealing and in new ways to pack and and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what i mean it's like not
touching it you know like it all goes down
[SPEAKER_03]: to how you harvest and how you dry and how
that cures and hey if you're touching it
[SPEAKER_03]: so many times you know i i'm so much
thought you're so detailed about what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing that it gets so obsessive you
know because you just care so much i'm
[SPEAKER_10]: sitting in my room with an active water
meter testing as it comes down all the way
[SPEAKER_10]: through and then i i was really interested
it's pretty cool about it and i screwed up
[SPEAKER_10]: and i left my lights out of my d i went
back in and i had dried all my tops down
[SPEAKER_10]: to like 50 uh rh in the room so i test the
act of water 40 41 now tell you about i
[SPEAKER_10]: always crop at 64 rh in my room relative
humidity on several strains straight
[SPEAKER_10]: across the board was 52 so then i brought
my humidity up to 70 relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_10]: all of my weed was 58 to 61 hear what i'm
saying yep and then what do you actually
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in so i've been looking at at you
know the storage aspect of it that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: a big part of it as well and what are you
looking at so which part so you know i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not dealing you know i'm dealing with like
240 pounds a week you know every 12 days
[SPEAKER_03]: you know there's like a new problem you
know so it's like you know we we look at
[SPEAKER_03]: those you know we look at it in terms of
like how you know we've got to keep this
[SPEAKER_10]: is we've got to keep this at under 64 you
got active water relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_10]: this is all with this is what we got to
talk about more like you said i got to
[SPEAKER_03]: catch a plane and i really want to get
into but hey that was awesome i mean it
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i mean these little it's funny like
small problems become very complex really
[SPEAKER_10]: quickly especially with the amount we're
dealing with in volume with these lp's
[SPEAKER_10]: you're doing with storing how they're
storing it yeah it's going all these and
[SPEAKER_10]: you know what i'm all with them because
i'm seeing these big videos these big
[SPEAKER_10]: productions i said i'm like i'm drooling
like wow look at this but how are they
[SPEAKER_10]: able to start like what mark's doing with
m bark see these are the next big steps
[SPEAKER_10]: all these extracts and how to store these
cannabinoids for future reference and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what's so awesome the way you guys
are also doing and looking at all these
[SPEAKER_10]: different extractions because flower is
not one thing but now we're stepping into
[SPEAKER_10]: the next field which is going to be
extraction it's going to be those edibles
[SPEAKER_10]: how are they storing those edibles how are
they you know this is all stuff they're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to have to really take a look at
before they legalize this here coming up
[SPEAKER_07]: on october of 2019 and and you know john
it's why i've always said that embarks
[SPEAKER_07]: part of embarks real value will be the um
the data that it collects 100 you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to be incredibly like just
priceless data you know like what would we
[SPEAKER_07]: pay for it right now if it came up for
sale if it existed and we could just buy
[SPEAKER_03]: it what would we pay for it that's part of
what we're doing in the states to market
[SPEAKER_03]: so like you know on the flip side you know
down here happy valley is really focusing
[SPEAKER_03]: on keeping our ethos forward you know like
not forgetting that we've got quality
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine to uphold not just a you know you
know manufacturing situation to to run um
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and it depends on who you want to
be in the market too you know there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of lps that might just be fine with
that you know yeah so yeah well you're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna have your like with anything in the
industry yeah you have your low grade
[SPEAKER_10]: you're gonna have your high rating have
people who set standards all across the
[SPEAKER_10]: board yeah donaldson you're gonna have
your your keg and you're gonna have your
[SPEAKER_10]: five star yeah we want to be on the five
star we're all five star we're all in that
[SPEAKER_10]: in that playing field that's what we want
that's what we focus on and that's what we
[SPEAKER_10]: want to see because hey you know what you
know grown one's fantastic and great but
[SPEAKER_10]: you know it consumes a lot of of my own
time and i like to see better quality hit
[SPEAKER_10]: the market so when i am in need i can
actually go and actually get something
[SPEAKER_10]: that is truly quality that i that i'm
gonna be able to consume that's gonna help
[SPEAKER_07]: me with my pain exactly because let's be
honest life's too short to be smoking swag
[SPEAKER_10]: camera no doubt no mids i'm setting a
lineup of these guys opening up clubs and
[SPEAKER_10]: i'm having you know you know humidity
control packs and stuff i'm trying to get
[SPEAKER_10]: people who've ever tried you never tried
cannabis before to get a true experience
[SPEAKER_10]: and not buy something that is dry or or
not done properly and stuff like that you
[SPEAKER_07]: know what i mean so i know it's a terrible
representation of what cannabis can be and
[SPEAKER_07]: i don't really think it's the faults
necessarily of lp it's like the government
[SPEAKER_07]: and the rules that they've placed on these
companies are like i'd like to see anyone
[SPEAKER_07]: try like they everyone fights for like we
should all be allowed to try it's like all
[SPEAKER_07]: right like you know that's a lot of
bankrupt people yeah you know that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: i see in the states right now is like
everybody just want you know especially at
[SPEAKER_03]: this whole the cbd you know craze right
now it's um it's actually pretty dangerous
[SPEAKER_03]: for the longevity of the of the industry
when you got stuff like that happening say
[SPEAKER_07]: it down d420k dude what's going on man
we've been waiting for that for an hour
[SPEAKER_07]: and 34 minutes no yeah no just 34 minutes
34 minutes and i put my right on well my
[SPEAKER_08]: bomb's ripping ready to go is everyone
else's yeah fucking headband rosin very
[SPEAKER_08]: nice creamy fucking wow wow we're gonna do
some glu some og cus some headband you got
[SPEAKER_08]: a got a few strains up here we're working
with right now that seemed to be pressing
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty greasy it's nice going in hard whoa
that was it i can still hear that in my
[SPEAKER_07]: headphones you know what last minute hash
church today but i'm very stoked to uh
[SPEAKER_07]: just have gotten some conversation in got
some peeps to come in some of the og's
[SPEAKER_07]: johnny and and d and and mike west and
having colin share what he's doing you
[SPEAKER_07]: know you never even mentioned which i
think is great colin it's hilarious you
[SPEAKER_07]: keep calling your company and your group
we but you haven't even mentioned the name
[SPEAKER_03]: of the actual company yeah so so we're
yeah so i guess that's a good thing i i
[SPEAKER_03]: should i should really well i think it's
it's for a lot of reason we're we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: you know getting all of our our materials
together and we're you know we're
[SPEAKER_03]: finishing our facility and i just think
the timing of it all and we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: working really hard behind the scenes as
you know marcus putting together and
[SPEAKER_03]: taking great care and crafting what we're
we're you know putting together um and
[SPEAKER_03]: happy valley is the name of the company
and marcus is uh is a part of that and um
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a lot of exciting great things
happening in terms of solventless tech um
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got 27 000 square feet of canopy
coming online with uh another um 60 60 to
[SPEAKER_03]: follow in the couple years behind that uh
hopefully sooner than that but it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: focused around solventless and putting our
ethos forward and making sure that we we
[SPEAKER_03]: do our best that that good medicine is put
into the right people's hands and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really at the end of the day we're trying
to do um so everything you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about johnny man it's like yeah that's
like where my head's at for the past year
[SPEAKER_03]: is just trying to figure out how each
cultivar that we know can be done in a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain amount of square foot uh facility
can now be scaled and and that same
[SPEAKER_03]: quality can be upheld all the way through
and i think we've you know we've we're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting there you know um and and you know
people like you and and sharing in these
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations will help us get get even
closer to what we're all looking for so
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah well you know what's the best thing
about what we do is we just keep doing
[SPEAKER_10]: what we love to do yep no doubt that's it
this is true this is true but yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: we're excited man we're gonna we're
launching in mass and uh most likely in
[SPEAKER_03]: the fall this year and you know it's just
this is like accumulation of so so many
[SPEAKER_03]: years of designing facilities and then
getting to this point this place with you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's such a beautiful facility you
know we're really really lucky to have
[SPEAKER_03]: this and and it's i'm really excited to
have marcus along for the ride with this
[SPEAKER_07]: one so hell yeah dude yeah assachusetts
yeah buddy representing you know what i
[SPEAKER_07]: gotta thank the 373 people that actually
in the last minute i don't know if they
[SPEAKER_07]: get a notification they must but thank you
guys for coming and hanging out you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: must be the ogs of hash church because uh
and everybody talks about hash church
[SPEAKER_10]: sorry oh nice and that's what and and all
the ones who are logging in and the guy's
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna do a hash church it says i don't
know and then today you did a hash church
[SPEAKER_10]: so you know what all those ogs out there
we love you yeah well it's been almost
[SPEAKER_07]: four years maybe over four years since we
started this uh this sort of conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: i guess you would say and you know i felt
like when it was going really strong that
[SPEAKER_07]: there were these new contenders that were
up and up and coming but when it dropped
[SPEAKER_07]: and we stopped doing it i really didn't
feel like anything replaced you know the
[SPEAKER_07]: weekly conversations that would occur and
i don't pretend to think that every minute
[SPEAKER_07]: of these conversations were worth
recording or whatnot but definitely there
[SPEAKER_07]: were always gems within the hours that we
shared each sunday that seemed to like
[SPEAKER_07]: manifest and put form to you know part of
the industry as we know it today and i i'm
[SPEAKER_07]: not trying to say that in a in a in a
bragging type of way because i was a very
[SPEAKER_07]: small part of it there was a hundred plus
people that came on and shared their
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation here on hash church over
those years but it is incredible from like
[SPEAKER_07]: the talking about rosin presses into an
entire industry the talking about all of
[SPEAKER_07]: these different things i mean even for me
for embark you know hash church was you
[SPEAKER_07]: know where i met mike west who is going to
be a big part of embark and who has
[SPEAKER_07]: already been a big part of embark and i i
met him on hash church literally he would
[SPEAKER_07]: come into hash church in his lab running
his co2 machine in the background while we
[SPEAKER_07]: were all having discussions and then every
hour or so we'd walk over to the mike and
[SPEAKER_07]: drop some crazy large like boom i'd be
like i gotta go back to the machine for a
[SPEAKER_07]: second so that's that's how i met you mike
was through hash church so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting to see i mean obviously i knew
uh johnny b and and d420k long before hash
[SPEAKER_07]: church i've known those guys for i don't
even know how long probably is about as
[SPEAKER_10]: long as i've known colin for that matter
hanging out just like three or four of us
[SPEAKER_10]: all the time chatting because we run
around but even way before that i mean
[SPEAKER_07]: holy shit i've known you guys for a couple
of decades it's a long time it's good to
[SPEAKER_03]: have you guys no doubt mike marcus what's
that mike just being able to you know hang
[SPEAKER_04]: out and watch church while you're sitting
in the lab for hours
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah yeah for sure no that's that's i
never really thought of that but i always
[SPEAKER_07]: had people contact me and tell me oh we
put hash church on in our in our uh you
[SPEAKER_07]: know glass shop or we put hash church on
in our in our uh dispensary i was like
[SPEAKER_07]: right on that's that's great i seen it a
few times i think i even was filming one
[SPEAKER_07]: time and i went into a dispenser i think
it was my friends in my orca and hash
[SPEAKER_07]: church was on their tvs and i was kind of
i asked him i was like did you do that on
[SPEAKER_07]: purpose and he was like no not at all it
was just the timing of walking in so that
[SPEAKER_07]: was pretty cool how about signing
autographs mark how about what signing
[SPEAKER_08]: autographs signing autographs what do you
mean just getting the pictures with those
[SPEAKER_08]: people at the mall at the airport oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah listen you're a fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: movie star you can sign autographs i'm
like a lowly hash maker but my my the
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff that i did nobody came up and talked
to me about it talked to us about they
[SPEAKER_08]: come up and centered us out you guys you
bet i love what you guys are doing the
[SPEAKER_08]: hash church is just nice i want to meet my
brother and sister for the first time
[SPEAKER_07]: you're filming that right i know that was
incredible dude that was awesome that was
[SPEAKER_07]: an emotional moment i was i was i wanted
to be part of it yeah it was awesome man
[SPEAKER_08]: it was it was really cool yeah no that was
definitely coming and ripping with us on
[SPEAKER_08]: christmas right so many nice memories of
really cool moments throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: thing like when we started this it was
just literally going in and getting high
[SPEAKER_08]: together showing what we're making on the
dry sift and stuff and i could check this
[SPEAKER_08]: out and our little parts and everything it
was like it was so brand new in the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry nobody was even selling dry sift
or anything like that because it was so
[SPEAKER_08]: hard to make and so hard to acquire that
when you got what you got you kept course
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking gold man gold dust peace out
johnny b thanks for dropping knowledge
[SPEAKER_07]: today people were impressed in the chat
room they said johnny b's on fire let's
[SPEAKER_10]: talk next week love you guys and darren
you rock man that dry sift thing don't
[SPEAKER_10]: forget the back of that card talk more
about that that's how look at how the hash
[SPEAKER_10]: church started even rosin with tony
pressing gold hash and that's all grown
[SPEAKER_10]: with the curling iron and like all of
these texts yeah they all started from us
[SPEAKER_10]: screwing around on house church guys you
rock peace peace brother i wonder how many
[SPEAKER_08]: things of uh how many industries have uh
started like businesses and everything
[SPEAKER_08]: like that because of everything that's
been millions of millionaires out there
[SPEAKER_07]: man i'll tell you the interesting thing
about that is that when you share the
[SPEAKER_07]: information and conversation things blow
up but when you hold your ip to yourself
[SPEAKER_07]: as strong as you can and this is the sort
of this is that hard part of coming from
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry and getting into these larger
companies where you're like okay like
[SPEAKER_07]: there's more on like it was easy to think
that way over here because it was just a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of thousand invested but when you
have tens of millions invested it's crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: how you have to be more careful and it's
too bad because you're right like a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: the conversations that happened on here
people were able to take that information
[SPEAKER_07]: that what they heard on here and basically
you know do something serious with it
[SPEAKER_07]: execute it whether for a small personal
gain to make a pure medicine for
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves or to a you know create and
produce medicine for others or maybe they
[SPEAKER_07]: started a company and touched tens of
thousands you know selling a product like
[SPEAKER_08]: a rosin press or something yeah well i'm
doing a consulting business up here in
[SPEAKER_08]: prince george is uh it's not quite uh
launched yet but it's going to be right
[SPEAKER_08]: away where it's just everybody can grow
their four plants and all that stuff but
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a way they got to do it they got
to register they got to do all this sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of stuff to make it to make it good for
themselves but i just want to show them
[SPEAKER_08]: how i do it myself and how i process it
myself whether i'm dry sifting bubbling or
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin the flower or the bubble hash
whatever and let them have their grow
[SPEAKER_08]: their medicine and and make it as pure as
they want and i'll go in and consult for
[SPEAKER_08]: them and do it for a very reasonable price
because it's only four plants at a time
[SPEAKER_08]: and these are all all just normal humans
man not wanting to get fucking taken to
[SPEAKER_08]: the cleaners to learn how to do something
right and it's just my way it's not like
[SPEAKER_08]: late like i i you know i don't know
everything but i do have access to pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: much everything i need to know if i want
to if i need to reach out for it right
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah exactly it's good this whole internet
thing go figure information is just
[SPEAKER_07]: available at our fingertips at any given
time and the cannabis industry is no doubt
[SPEAKER_07]: blowing up with once again companies like
embark willing to set and set a new bar
[SPEAKER_07]: and we certainly won't be the last and we
certainly aren't the first to set a new
[SPEAKER_07]: bar and that's how things just keep
escalating and escalating to a point where
[SPEAKER_07]: for me i love the idea of i'll always love
the idea of of personal gross of people
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to grow their own to me that's
sacred and people should always be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: have that but the bottom line is because i
have a license to grow my own and don't
[SPEAKER_07]: have a plant in the ground it's actually a
lot of work and takes a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_07]: and focus and it's not just something you
can do in the background when you have
[SPEAKER_07]: multiple kids and five businesses and you
get pulled in 12 different directions at
[SPEAKER_07]: any given time i can't i don't have time
to grow cannabis to take care of it
[SPEAKER_07]: properly and that's that's that's the
truth for a lot of people so in that sense
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis needs to be made accessible to
all those other people who should have
[SPEAKER_07]: access to as the same as the person who
decides they want to grow it for
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves and i think what johnny b was
talking about well i know it because i
[SPEAKER_07]: used to broker cannabis myself i know what
good cannabis looks like and what bad
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis looks like and when you package
great cannabis incorrectly at the wrong
[SPEAKER_07]: time with the wrong amount of moisture for
the wrong amount of time you destroy it
[SPEAKER_07]: you absolutely fuck it up it goes from
being like a whatever they call it now it
[SPEAKER_07]: used to be a trip i guess it's a quad
quadruple a this goes down to like in my
[SPEAKER_07]: opinion a c when it just gets wet and it
just gets funky and hay-like smelling and
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't cure outright and the turps are
fucked and everything's fucked that that
[SPEAKER_07]: is not necessarily on the grower you know
unless he's also the guy that packaged it
[SPEAKER_07]: up now if you're working for a company and
you grow some great cannabis and you give
[SPEAKER_07]: it to the company and then they package it
incorrectly and you know go figure as well
[SPEAKER_07]: i think a lot of that packaging
incorrectly is not accidental i think that
[SPEAKER_07]: these that these government agencies like
health canada they seem to go out of their
[SPEAKER_07]: way to make things not as easy as they
could be i don't know why i've been
[SPEAKER_07]: dealing with them since 1994 when we
applied for a hemp license and although i
[SPEAKER_07]: will say this about health canada because
it's easy to get upset with what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing and how they're doing it they have
at least grown immensely over the course
[SPEAKER_07]: of the last 20 years since they started
doing licensing in canada it's amazing how
[SPEAKER_07]: much more and more and more and more is
available it hasn't been like an ironclad
[SPEAKER_07]: like this is what you get and this and for
the last 20 years that's all we've got
[SPEAKER_07]: we've consistently added more and more
things so i suspect it's like a damn door
[SPEAKER_07]: that will eventually burst open and the
cannabis consciousness will flood through
[SPEAKER_07]: in a way that they can finally i think
we'll laugh one day when we look back that
[SPEAKER_07]: we used to have to treat cannabis like
plutonium with you know level nine vaults
[SPEAKER_07]: with biometrics to acquire entry and like
all these other things you know that's i
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know i just think as a as a as a as
a industry we could we could commit more
[SPEAKER_07]: to better things like if you didn't have
to spend two million dollars on your vault
[SPEAKER_07]: you could donate like 500 grand to like
you know building schools somewhere you
[SPEAKER_07]: know helping with education or in some way
creating philanthropy but they just create
[SPEAKER_03]: this enormous amount of of resistance yeah
and resistance and we yeah we well the
[SPEAKER_03]: other thing is is that i see in terms of
like packaging we don't have the we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a machine we have some machines we're
very limited i don't want to say we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have machines because we do we have very
limited machines that are within our reach
[SPEAKER_03]: that actually handle the material right we
we just we don't we we have things like
[SPEAKER_03]: dog food sorters that are they're trying
to pass off as sorters for for our
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and it's just not the right way
to do it um but i understand how long it
[SPEAKER_03]: takes to pack 30 000 units that's a long
time man yeah um so there's nothing else
[SPEAKER_07]: like it though is there with these
volatile gases evaporating off the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: while moisture contents are are also
evaporating and mixing with the terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: in the air and going back into the plant
this smells amazing but it's never it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just going into my face oh yeah yeah
you're right though but yeah it's we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: get there though i think it's we're just
at the inception a lot of this and that's
[SPEAKER_07]: the infancy for sure yep yeah we're just
trying and trying a lot of great people
[SPEAKER_07]: focused on trying to make it the best that
we can make it you know and i i don't just
[SPEAKER_07]: mean like the companies i'm working with i
mean there's a ton of great people in this
[SPEAKER_07]: industry that are kind of focused on and i
think sometimes people get a little like
[SPEAKER_07]: you know kind of like oh who's this new
person or whatever doing this that and the
[SPEAKER_07]: other thing but for me i just i'm like a
kid in a candy store i'm like so excited
[SPEAKER_07]: like i saw canopy announce martha stewart
the other day for their cbd brand and i
[SPEAKER_07]: was like it just put a smile on my face i
was like and then of course other people
[SPEAKER_07]: were offended by what does martha stewart
know i'm like i don't know she just has
[SPEAKER_07]: like a distribution access to like 490
million women around the world like yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: what does martha stewart know like i i
just i thought it was cool other people
[SPEAKER_08]: they didn't think it was so cool i guess
but the steward is solid man she's gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: turn her fucking time she did her bid i
get i get booze size of it man but but
[SPEAKER_03]: you're right i mean it's canopy smart man
they came in you know you know they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not you know they're a tough one
they're they're very very aggressive
[SPEAKER_03]: company man you know hey hey regardless i
just definitely make me feel
[SPEAKER_03]: self-conscious you know i think everybody
will agree not me not me i saw that listen
[SPEAKER_03]: they make you think about now the reality
of what's happening around us and it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: large and out of control that it's it's
really puts reality spin on it i'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: honest i saw that simply as i'm gonna
supply that with cbd hey some people find
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity absolutely i totally see that
um yeah no doubt it's a it's a listen
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime there's someone's pushing a
cannabinoid i find that positive yeah i
[SPEAKER_07]: mean i don't know everybody off of martha
stewart did her bid right d she did oh
[SPEAKER_07]: that's funny i love all the different
perspectives from hash church it's hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know it's hard it's a hard thing
to watch you know i can just imagine
[SPEAKER_07]: someone who's never been on hash church
before talking about this tomorrow at work
[SPEAKER_07]: when they're like they were talking and
when that guy when that guy in the slayer
[SPEAKER_08]: shirt said she did her bid i fell off my
chair leave her alone she didn't take no
[SPEAKER_08]: one with her either she's solid yeah
exactly not a caesar solid either solid
[SPEAKER_07]: solid oh my goodness thank god for having
a hash church today i missed it i'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: honest i needed one of these oh i just had
to be done had to be done so i should
[SPEAKER_07]: mention a few things because there's all
these other things that are coming up and
[SPEAKER_07]: happening let me see if i can figure this
out actually because this is somewhat
[SPEAKER_07]: important i want i have a few
announcements to make so yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: announcements but i have to be smart how i
make the announcements i thought better
[SPEAKER_07]: than talking about it i would kind of show
it but it's on instagram so it's not quite
[SPEAKER_07]: and i don't even know if he sent it to me
oh my god did he no it's on here i wonder
[SPEAKER_07]: how i'm going to be able to maybe i can
repost it is that what i can do sorry for
[SPEAKER_07]: sounding like a 65 year old like never
been on technology before i don't know
[SPEAKER_07]: what these buttons are doing now also
sorry to all my 65 year old friends
[SPEAKER_07]: because i was a terrible stereotype oh my
goodness okay so i was going to announce
[SPEAKER_07]: the i'm going to be a judge well first
first first things first the team at
[SPEAKER_07]: embark is heading to the icbc conference
in spain march 14th so that's going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: really cool that's with alex rogers who
was on hash church the last time uh
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about it actually and so we have
uh we'll be there we i think i'm speaking
[SPEAKER_07]: on a panel and then the after party is
going to be lit it's damian marley which
[SPEAKER_07]: i'm pretty stoked about having an after
party at the w uh with damian marley in
[SPEAKER_07]: barcelona that's just going to be surreal
to say the least so hopefully anyone
[SPEAKER_07]: that's coming to spannabis will make sure
you show up a day early because spannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: which we will also be at is the 15th 16th
and 17th and that's um that's in barcelona
[SPEAKER_07]: in the hospitalette zone and it'll be the
same area that it's always been in and
[SPEAKER_07]: i'll probably be walking around and
cruising around and then also i'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be this is a full circle with hq hemp
quarters in barcelona the first uh place i
[SPEAKER_07]: ever got a membership at a great guy owns
owned by david he does a contest called
[SPEAKER_07]: masters of rosin you might have seen it
you can check it out on instagram at
[SPEAKER_07]: masters of rosin and he's got like crocket
and dna and like a whole bunch of really
[SPEAKER_07]: cool people that were judges i hadn't been
in touch with him to let him know that i
[SPEAKER_07]: was going but i did let him know i was
going a couple weeks ago and i guess
[SPEAKER_07]: jerome baker uh jason harris wasn't able
to make it so his spot dropped and so
[SPEAKER_07]: david called me and now i'm going to be a
judge in that um uh um wow what an amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: time skunk man sam although you are
reverberating right now because the next
[SPEAKER_07]: thing i'm getting to is the legends of
hash actually i like the echo legends of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash oh fuck come on i'm having fun dude
here let me let me see if i can bring it
[SPEAKER_07]: up because uh we are doing a legends of
hash this year and uh we're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: doing it with flap 421 and flux who's uh i
guess got himself a a spot in barcelona so
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to be kind of breaking that in
with the legends of hash it's always the
[SPEAKER_07]: same there's a legends of hash there's no
trophies there's no like announcements of
[SPEAKER_07]: like this that and the other thing it's
just like if you want to come and smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: some hash we'll have some people judging
there will be a small announcement that
[SPEAKER_07]: you know first second and third and why
the judges thought that but really that's
[SPEAKER_07]: the main the main thing is to come
celebrate hashish with us and uh nothing
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing uh nothing more so let me find
this picture because we finally got the
[SPEAKER_07]: the shot done and then let me go to screen
save so i can show you what it looks like
[SPEAKER_07]: all right here we go start screen share is
that all worked oh no there it goes so
[SPEAKER_07]: what do you think of that barcelona sunday
yeah mark 17 legends of hash and then i'll
[SPEAKER_07]: be uh supplying the address to the place
when you get your ticket so we're super
[SPEAKER_07]: excited about that shout out to suomi
laval uh this is one of his photos from
[SPEAKER_07]: the great book hashish it is called
hashish right skunk man sam absolutely
[SPEAKER_07]: correct hashish yeah it's kind of marcus
yeah yeah well like like i said shout out
[SPEAKER_07]: to those those folks uh screen in the hash
and shout out to suomi or whoever took i
[SPEAKER_07]: think he took all his photos as well is
that is that also correct or incorrect sam
[SPEAKER_11]: i'm not sure if he took all the photos but
i would not be surprised there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of words in the book it has a short
introduction by uh some that's true but
[SPEAKER_11]: somebody in some famous guy in england but
right well there it is the those are my
[SPEAKER_07]: announcements anyway for uh icbc spandibus
legends of hash masters of rosin i should
[SPEAKER_07]: make a legends of hash instagram but now
i've said it and some trolls already
[SPEAKER_07]: registered it so i guess i won't do that
he's gonna be like pay me for it no no
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not doing that we don't tell oh i
know another thing that i'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: mention we are going to have the good
folks at move the movement i invited
[SPEAKER_07]: darryl in today i kind of wanted him to
talk about it a little bit but i don't
[SPEAKER_07]: know if you guys saw those a couple of
interviews i did with these guys it was in
[SPEAKER_07]: a really cool building i think it was was
it the chant no it wasn't the chat it
[SPEAKER_07]: might have been the chant center i can't
remember it was a cool building on the ubc
[SPEAKER_07]: campus uh really cool round like it just
had a really great look to it and he did a
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of interviews with kirk two saw and
john conroy and and chris bennett and
[SPEAKER_07]: myself and a whole bunch of other people
so they if you check out move the movement
[SPEAKER_07]: it's um it's a really great thing that
they're doing kind of getting these great
[SPEAKER_07]: stories out of the community in a really
professional manner editing really to
[SPEAKER_07]: perfection and then and then putting it
out as a very enjoyable story they're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be coming to spain with us and
they're going to film i guess two full
[SPEAKER_07]: days with us so or with me and and the
crew and so i don't know exactly um what
[SPEAKER_07]: those two days will be but i suspect it
will for sure be the icbc conference
[SPEAKER_07]: because that'll be a whole day and then
hopefully he'll do like a section of
[SPEAKER_07]: masters of rosin because there'll be some
great footage there as well as a a portion
[SPEAKER_07]: of the legends which is going to be the
first time i know sam's probably like what
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like yeah if uh you know this will be
the first time we've actually uh allowed
[SPEAKER_07]: uh anyone to take a video but there also
won't be the same group of people that
[SPEAKER_07]: were particular about not being on video
uh over the last 20 years however if skunk
[SPEAKER_07]: man sam decides to grace us with his
presence there will not be video anywhere
[SPEAKER_07]: near where he is oh my god who's that guy
in the bella clava so how are you doing
[SPEAKER_11]: skunk man sam how are things in amsterdam
it's okay and when you come to the eu are
[SPEAKER_11]: you just going to spain are you going
anyplace else in the eu i tried to come
[SPEAKER_07]: through amsterdam and klm was all sold out
so i ended up having to go through germany
[SPEAKER_11]: so because there's no direct flights for
me you probably need your vibrations more
[SPEAKER_07]: than amsterdam to be honest well i was
kind of hoping i won't lie that i was
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be able to spend at least a day
with uh with you and yours that's what i
[SPEAKER_07]: was trying to to make happen and i
couldn't believe it personally because i
[SPEAKER_07]: booked the flight like a week and a half
ago or something and it's not for another
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of weeks i guess it's less than a
couple weeks now wow jeez time's really
[SPEAKER_11]: flying here in europe people book things
three months six months in the past jesus
[SPEAKER_07]: how do they do that how could you possibly
know where you're going to be know with
[SPEAKER_11]: their working schedule when they're going
to be on holiday everybody oh my god what
[SPEAKER_07]: a nightmare i guess that's why i've been
told to avoid certain places during
[SPEAKER_07]: certain times in like the south in the
mediterranean you know italy france spain
[SPEAKER_07]: the islands menorca mayorka ebita they
just fill up with people like you said at
[SPEAKER_07]: the all at the exact same time like it's
probably dead the day before and then
[SPEAKER_07]: literally the next day it's like at full
capacity and they're all on the roads and
[SPEAKER_11]: they're all flying they're all driving i
mean you just yeah it's not so fun no i
[SPEAKER_07]: can't deal with that i can't deal with
that well it was a last minute hash church
[SPEAKER_07]: today did you did you actually mention the
company yet colin or no yeah i did i did a
[SPEAKER_07]: while back okay because i thought i was
waiting happy valley happy valley it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: happy valley it's been we're uh yeah man
it's really exciting because we you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we spent so much time behind the scenes uh
over the past two decades that it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice to come out with an outfit that
allows us to come into the market man and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it feels really special to be able to
be a part of that and a way that we get to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do it our way and that's that's
really you know that's that's what i'm
[SPEAKER_07]: looking forward to so for sure it's
exciting big big things big things i mean
[SPEAKER_07]: i feel the same listen i've known you for
almost 20 years as well and i'm going
[SPEAKER_07]: through the exact same thing you know this
exciting time of finally having a team
[SPEAKER_07]: together that can execute a plan you know
not having to have like you know sold my
[SPEAKER_07]: soul to an lp like i avoided that and just
to create my own thing like create our own
[SPEAKER_07]: thing that's exactly that's different from
from anything else so you know definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: the the the best of lucks to uh the
embarks in the happy valleys of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis world that's for sure i'm fucking
yeah we're i think we're good we're
[SPEAKER_03]: excited to be be good stewards of the
plant and preservationists of genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that these things live on and in
a way that they get to be able to be used
[SPEAKER_03]: by by as many patients as we can and um
you know that's part of the just part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the process you know going through all the
stock and going through old stock and
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll be fun absolutely you know but yeah
so i've got to get going guys but um i
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate the time that i've spent with
you all and um i look forward to being on
[SPEAKER_07]: next time thank you for coming out dude i
appreciate it last minute as well i put
[SPEAKER_07]: the word out to about 20 folks so i was
happy to get you know five five six people
[SPEAKER_03]: come in that was great yeah sam always an
honor to be on with you i would love to
[SPEAKER_03]: ask you a million questions but uh i've
got to get going but i was going to ask
[SPEAKER_11]: you a question too about preservation of a
variety yeah please variety or a clonal
[SPEAKER_11]: variety because preservation of seed
varieties that's a lot of work you've got
[SPEAKER_11]: to reproduce it with at least 2000 uh
individual plants every every year no
[SPEAKER_03]: doubt so that's that's a great question so
it's now that i have the space to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be i'm going to get into
preservation of seed form before it was
[SPEAKER_03]: all about just preserving um specific
cultivars and phenotypes and now it's
[SPEAKER_03]: about going in and actually preserving
lines uh in a way i've never even had
[SPEAKER_03]: access to do it you know i've never really
had i've never been able to to to not only
[SPEAKER_03]: just monocrop um so this is a really
unique situation for me to be able to have
[SPEAKER_03]: um upwards to 15 000 square feet just to
preserve um and explore i've been doing it
[SPEAKER_11]: a long time and uh we we came up with the
minimum number is 2000 for a male female
[SPEAKER_03]: seed variety well that's yeah i i share
that same sentiment and i i'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn a bit more about your your
ideologies and what you've learned over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years obviously you've spent
tremendous amount of times with the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and in numerous size facilities and i
think it i can only benefit from your
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge you know so it it would be
awesome to sit down with you and talk
[SPEAKER_11]: about that and in terms of numbers what
have you seen at 2000 um then you're not
[SPEAKER_11]: preserving the genes in that variety
you're preserving some of them right so
[SPEAKER_03]: you're okay that makes a lot of sense so
you're basically at that under 2000 you're
[SPEAKER_03]: basically selective breeding or really
selective preservation or selective
[SPEAKER_11]: preservation you're not selecting the
entire gene pool of that land race variety
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly right okay that makes a lot of
sense um a lot yeah okay so in terms of a
[SPEAKER_03]: of a hybrid variety that's maybe a
polybryd polyhybrid you do you think that
[SPEAKER_03]: more seeds need to be kept because there's
more genetic variation happening uh i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: there you're not going to be keeping the
same material because you'll be keeping
[SPEAKER_11]: what f2s at threes at four i mean they
segregate out that's the way it works that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes sense and do you believe in in
preservation uh specifically preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: do you believe open pollination with many
males is is the only way to preserve for a
[SPEAKER_11]: land race absolutely it's the only way and
for uh so all you young guys out there
[SPEAKER_11]: listening in take note of this so for a
land race that's the minimum number so
[SPEAKER_03]: that makes a lot of sense because you know
today what we have is is is mostly what i
[SPEAKER_03]: would call very limited selective breeding
going on so we're very our scope is so and
[SPEAKER_03]: our lens is so narrow that when we do find
something desirable um it just makes you
[SPEAKER_03]: wonder um how many other desirable traits
are in that that same gene pool if they're
[SPEAKER_11]: actually at the space to run it if you
think about how land races are created uh
[SPEAKER_11]: people start growing cannabis in a
particular area whether that's afghanistan
[SPEAKER_11]: or thailand or burma or whatever and uh
they uh but the gene pool there is limited
[SPEAKER_11]: by it's a large population because the
farmers there will grow thousands and
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands and thousands of plants
sometimes even bigger and uh but it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: cut off from other gene flow so it it
becomes it settles down and becomes its
[SPEAKER_11]: own land race its own variety with a
unique set of genes and uh terpenic
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids and that's what you want to
preserve everything right okay so here's a
[SPEAKER_03]: question for you in terms of um of land
race varieties what i'm seeing a lot today
[SPEAKER_03]: is a lot of people are going out trekking
out there and collecting some land race
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they're furthering the line maybe
they're doing some inbreeding and then
[SPEAKER_03]: predominantly a lot of the people i've
talked to they've ran that same variety
[SPEAKER_03]: they're getting a lot of hermaphrodite
traits because they're running them in
[SPEAKER_03]: environments that they're just these the
progeny and the genetics itself are just
[SPEAKER_03]: so foreign to it itself that it just
starts to have adverse reactions to it
[SPEAKER_03]: what are your thoughts on inbreeding those
types of lines to make them readily
[SPEAKER_03]: available are we kind of damaging those
lines by doing things like that well i
[SPEAKER_11]: don't understand what you mean by
inbreeding are you mean inbreeding or
[SPEAKER_03]: hybridizing what well you're taking let's
say we find a male and a female of of the
[SPEAKER_03]: same variety and then we make more seeds
out of that okay but we narrow the scope
[SPEAKER_03]: by only having like a few different
females and maybe five or ten different
[SPEAKER_03]: females and five to twenty males that are
pollinating these things it's clearly not
[SPEAKER_11]: enough to to preserve the but you may
preserve some really nice good examples
[SPEAKER_11]: and a segment of that gene pool you might
preserve and it might be really
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting i can't say without seeing it
sure okay well that kind of answers it
[SPEAKER_03]: because i i think a lot of people are that
i've talked to outside of my personal
[SPEAKER_03]: experience are finding a lot of
hermaphrodite traits coming out because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're running them inside and in
environment under lighting that they're
[SPEAKER_11]: not used to i have not really seen uh
hermaphrodite uh being expressed by that i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean if if a variety does not have
intersex genes then usually fuck it around
[SPEAKER_11]: with it doesn't really change it i mean uh
i i've seen stuff grown under lights or
[SPEAKER_11]: grown in greenhouses and uh that or green
or outdoors in the ground then doesn't
[SPEAKER_11]: seem to really change alter the uh the uh
intersex expression particularly that i've
[SPEAKER_11]: seen now there are some there are certain
varieties like thai which are
[SPEAKER_11]: intrinsically uh intersex just because
they were grown for subsamia for hundreds
[SPEAKER_11]: if not thousands of years and uh the few
seeds that they did found were very likely
[SPEAKER_03]: caused by intersex sure i always think
it's to be honest when when i hear people
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me those things i always believe it's
their environment that's causing the
[SPEAKER_03]: problems not the not the actual genetics
um so that that kind of reaffirms well
[SPEAKER_11]: i've got i've come across varieties that
you uh no matter what kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: environmental stress you put on them it
they would not express uh any sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: intersex uh expression at all zero and it
would be interesting to take those to
[SPEAKER_11]: where you're talking about and you try to
make them turn intersect yeah well it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll be interesting you know i've i've
got a few varieties there's some iranian
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that i've i was given that i
want i'm very interested to run and um a
[SPEAKER_03]: few things from morocco and nepal that
should be really interesting and to to run
[SPEAKER_03]: in the coming months and i'm actually
really excited about them the biggest
[SPEAKER_11]: problem too is when people collect
land-raised seeds today is are they pure
[SPEAKER_11]: for example in morocco there are no pure
land races they're all gone the same thing
[SPEAKER_11]: in jamaica and uh probably in mexico and
uh any other country where lots of
[SPEAKER_11]: westerners go and take seeds to help the
locals so here's another good question in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of latin truth and so i i've
actually i share that same ideology where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like i don't i feel like at this day
and age it's almost nearly impossible to
[SPEAKER_03]: find true land race unless you really go
very very deep um and that takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: effort and not everybody's built for that
um but i think what i also technically
[SPEAKER_11]: it's illegal today because there are
genetic uh treaties worldwide that all the
[SPEAKER_11]: countries are signatory to that says you
cannot go and take genes from a country
[SPEAKER_11]: like thailand or or india or wherever and
take them back to america reproduce them
[SPEAKER_11]: and sell them for profit without sharing
with both the government and the farmers
[SPEAKER_11]: and etc etc that's all that wasn't there
when i was collecting seeds but it's there
[SPEAKER_03]: now yeah i would imagine you know when you
were avidly collecting in that in that way
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would probably come across things
that and i'm sure you probably still have
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these things that are throwing
expressions out that are just not seen
[SPEAKER_03]: today um at all um and that's that's
that's pretty exciting place to be sam and
[SPEAKER_11]: also really is all the different
cannabinoids and terrapins and different
[SPEAKER_11]: expressions of ratios and well also too
some plants are auto some plants are are
[SPEAKER_11]: all female so i mean there are wide leaves
skinny leaf early late maturing etc etc
[SPEAKER_11]: etc but i mean really it's the terpenes
with thc as a recreational user that i
[SPEAKER_03]: personally am interested in absolutely and
the the idea that you know we've come
[SPEAKER_03]: across that that a single cannabinoid is
is therapeutic is really interesting to me
[SPEAKER_03]: um do you think through the years of you
being involved in cannabinoids was there
[SPEAKER_03]: such a heavy you know did did they always
weigh so much um strength into a single
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid or is this do you feel this is
really a 20 or 21st century thing i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: recreational cannabis traditionally was
pretty much all thc ganja if you analyze
[SPEAKER_11]: it it was pretty much just thc now hashish
also had other cannabinoids because it
[SPEAKER_11]: wasn't picked for uh they didn't smoke
individual plants the way they do with
[SPEAKER_11]: ganja so you could save the seeds of the
best pretty easy you just get the most
[SPEAKER_11]: resonance with the biggest yield and the
best quality because you smoke it but with
[SPEAKER_11]: hashish they collected the most resinous
plants so sometimes it was all thc and
[SPEAKER_11]: sometimes it wasn't but since they were
smoking resin from a field not from
[SPEAKER_03]: individual plants nobody really knew right
and that's the that's the weird place that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're in now is we know so much and we
continue to learn so much that it's you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's like paired up you know it's
just opening up a whole vortex you know
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's interesting i i appreciate that
insight um in terms of like now here's
[SPEAKER_03]: another question in terms of of terpene
profile you know we you know the western
[SPEAKER_03]: world has landed on this gassy diesel-y
chemi thing um you know i've seen that in
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of afghan variety varieties and
broadleaf varieties are there any other
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties like the bang or like you know
any any like a citrile like citrile that
[SPEAKER_03]: are that express those types of traits or
is that very much um do you believe in you
[SPEAKER_03]: know just coming out of just being a
hybrid um you know in a poly hybrid or
[SPEAKER_03]: those types of in terms of land race are
those types of smells um foreign to you or
[SPEAKER_11]: they are they very familiar i i'm not sure
if it uh is because it's a hybrid in other
[SPEAKER_11]: words the diesel and that kind of stuff i
i'm not sure i i i don't have a deep
[SPEAKER_11]: background with diesel so i i can't really
speak authoritatively but one thing i can
[SPEAKER_11]: tell you is absolutely people prefer high
terpene contents their particular uh
[SPEAKER_11]: individual terpenes they enjoy might be
different for each person but absolutely
[SPEAKER_11]: it's better and traditionally it was hard
to find because cannabis by the time it
[SPEAKER_11]: arrived in america if it was an imported
product years and years ago it had uh then
[SPEAKER_11]: uh dried maybe in the sun but it had been
processed it had been shipped really long
[SPEAKER_11]: distance so it was nowhere near as terpene
rich as the varieties that we have now and
[SPEAKER_11]: uh when you smoke a really rich terpene
variety i mean there is no doubt that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: better yeah no doubt yeah in terms of hash
you know i i've heard you say since
[SPEAKER_03]: numerous times that um terpenes can be
washed away with water are there specific
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that you've noticed that hold
true to their terpene profile more than
[SPEAKER_11]: others um over the years i would think
marcus knows better than me but over here
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the ones that was known to do that
was uh what was that variety uh i forgot
[SPEAKER_11]: the name of it i'm sorry but marcus you
know a bunch of varieties that are that
[SPEAKER_11]: retain most of their terpenes when water
process there's definitely some and i'll
[SPEAKER_07]: never forget the first one i ever came
across was the renee which seemed to be
[SPEAKER_07]: some type of like like often blueberry and
renee were mistaken for one another they
[SPEAKER_07]: it was very dense and it grew these just
incredible i mean i'm talking like i'm not
[SPEAKER_07]: really even sure if i've ever smelled a
terpene profile stinkier than the original
[SPEAKER_07]: renee i mean it was it got people kicked
what's that one of the ones with uh that
[SPEAKER_11]: held up against water here i remember now
it was the uh chitral oh citral yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: that one did have a nice lemony flavor it
kept the smell after water process yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: locomotion you smelled that yeah that's a
good one that retains i mean i have a list
[SPEAKER_03]: of ones that work really well sam i was
just curious that if if you and your
[SPEAKER_03]: personal experience had had any that were
your kind of your favorites that's why i
[SPEAKER_03]: asked it but yeah i mean there's a yeah
there's a long list of how about that how
[SPEAKER_11]: about that one we made in jamaica that
time that's what was trippy about that one
[SPEAKER_11]: too was the color the color oh yeah
beautiful reddish reddish brownish goldish
[SPEAKER_07]: oh yeah no i remember it i'll never forget
that hash but yes it had a different smell
[SPEAKER_11]: it it smelled like a uh uh it wasn't you
know raw marijuana or just ganja yeah no
[SPEAKER_07]: it wasn't it was a contender let me tell
you it was a contender it was so nice to
[SPEAKER_07]: have just a big ball of it to just be like
in jamaica love and life with a big ball
[SPEAKER_11]: of melt just like this is good this is
good well what's nice about jamaica is you
[SPEAKER_11]: can buy you know a kilo of weed for 100 or
200 bucks or whatever and who cares you
[SPEAKER_11]: just grind it up and make some water hatch
yep yep that's uh i mean that's what i was
[SPEAKER_07]: doing i was even happy to be honest once i
knew i was getting the quality that i got
[SPEAKER_07]: with you that time i was happy to pay 300
bucks it's like dude here's some extra
[SPEAKER_07]: like you're doing a great job you know i'd
go visit his grow and he didn't have one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the things i always had to do in
jamaica in particular was i'd i'd go
[SPEAKER_07]: around the outer perimeters of the
property however big his property was and
[SPEAKER_07]: if i because often they you know they
don't have any way of disposing certain
[SPEAKER_07]: things and so if they were using you know
chemicals pesticides fungicides all these
[SPEAKER_07]: nasty things on their plants you could
usually find the bottles somewhere on the
[SPEAKER_07]: property and that particular guy the
doctor he never used chemicals period he
[SPEAKER_07]: was hilarious actually he thought the bugs
were there to tell him what fruit was the
[SPEAKER_07]: safest to eat so he was like he'd pick a
sugar cane and he'd be like see the worm
[SPEAKER_07]: like this one he's like no chemicals and
then he'd cut the worm section out and
[SPEAKER_07]: like squeeze the cane juice by hand into a
little kibosh for me with you know like a
[SPEAKER_07]: hint of passion fruit and a little lemon
this is like on the top of his grow that i
[SPEAKER_07]: i took pete brady there from cannabis
culture the photographer and i took raymo
[SPEAKER_07]: up there as well which uh holy smokes it
was uh quite a challenge to say the least
[SPEAKER_07]: good times in jamaica hey what's going on
pop that was cool just this dog whose dog
[SPEAKER_07]: is that dude that's that's the hash church
mascot what are you talking about it looks
[SPEAKER_07]: like yoda it did i thought he was about to
drop serious knowledge yeah he's got some
[SPEAKER_07]: serious knowledge to drop these wages he
was gonna say great hash you will make
[SPEAKER_07]: that's awesome what's up dude what's going
on right
[SPEAKER_07]: raccombs oh can you hear me all right i
can hear you just fine but your lips
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't moving there you go you look like
that's what you would sound like this is
[SPEAKER_07]: the ceo himself oh your lips moved that
time that was cool that's awesome dude
[SPEAKER_07]: right on beautiful beautiful animal cheers
guys i love dogs welcome we're just uh
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just kind of shooting the shit you
know i don't even know what our
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation was about but uh welcome i'm
sure our conversation is about to get into
[SPEAKER_07]: hash and oil glad i could be here yeah
dude for sure i'm sure most of you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: know raccombs have checked out his
instagram he's been making the big hand
[SPEAKER_07]: rolled like fucking harry potter wands of
diamonds yeah something like that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely going to be on the the the part
two of raw the past present and future of
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin because people are looking for that
advanced tech yeah a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_02]: been trying to reach out to me and uh phil
obviously you know shout out to him for
[SPEAKER_02]: being the first one to kind of put that on
the map so to speak straight up dude i'll
[SPEAKER_07]: never forget the way when he first posted
those like just in a in a before he broke
[SPEAKER_07]: them like there was a pile of them yeah i
was like what the fuck is this i was the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same way i just couldn't believe it
was like wait what's going on here i love
[SPEAKER_07]: that about the cannabis uh scene you know
something can just happen overnight where
[SPEAKER_07]: you're suddenly like it's like okay and
and you know what the the key has always
[SPEAKER_07]: been and i i always say this to people
like the key is obviously to have the
[SPEAKER_07]: passion to want to do these things but to
have the material to do it with if you you
[SPEAKER_07]: know that's how bubble bags really took
off because i was in this very unique
[SPEAKER_07]: position and had access to just a stupid
amount of of of products to to make hash
[SPEAKER_07]: with it was insane it was like to the
point where you know even when pot was
[SPEAKER_07]: still selling for like three thousand
dollars a pound my friends would come over
[SPEAKER_07]: with like two or three pounds of like
beautiful flour like this is in like you
[SPEAKER_07]: know early 2000 and and just drop it into
the 20 gallon bags and and make a batch of
[SPEAKER_07]: water hash with it and i was just like
damn dude that was like a like a nine
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand dollar batch whatever chic rose
entries smuggler in the sky said there's
[SPEAKER_11]: two kinds of folks that deal with cannabis
i love this quote those who use forklifts
[SPEAKER_07]: and those who don't yeah that you know
what that joke should always be told with
[SPEAKER_07]: a sound effect in the background beep beep
beep beep yep and what what quote was that
[SPEAKER_07]: from was that from howard marx mr nice or
who did you say said that no uh it was
[SPEAKER_07]: some hippie dog friend of mine oh really
because howard marx definitely has that in
[SPEAKER_07]: his book maybe it was from your hippie dog
friend i wouldn't be surprised he's
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely mentioning people that you knew
i would guess i knew some of those folks i
[SPEAKER_07]: figured you did i figured you did what's
that darren how are the diamonds made oh
[SPEAKER_08]: here we go yes sir yes sir man i was why
look same with those fucking worms exactly
[SPEAKER_08]: i can't believe it how do you do it buddy
i mean it's really it's really really
[SPEAKER_02]: basic i've showed it online a little bit
now i've kind of released a tech to a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain extent um i mean i'm not sure if
how phil felt about that because he was
[SPEAKER_02]: the first one who didn't really share it
probably before his own specific reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: but i just got to the point where it was
such common sense to me when i realized i
[SPEAKER_02]: was done that i just felt like i needed to
share with people it's just it's a matter
[SPEAKER_02]: of keeping the the material malleable
enough to form it in the way that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to there's no trick there's no magic
there's no hog wart shit it's just really
[SPEAKER_07]: basic hey did you share that just on a
story or in an actual post um i think i
[SPEAKER_02]: did a time lapse post or i did i did an
actual live story um which i saved and
[SPEAKER_02]: then i um i think you saved it yeah i'm
gonna be putting that on youtube here
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty soon i think i'm gonna edit it and
do it proper but um which one is it is it
[SPEAKER_02]: um i can't remember to be honest with you
have to go back but um essentially it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's just melting down your a at a
certain point to where it's not completely
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% de-carving because you got to get it
to that point to where it can liquefy and
[SPEAKER_02]: go from that chalky consistency to the
liquid consistency and then form it while
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cooling down but that's the trick
right you wait too long it'll just shatter
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the place you do it too early
it'll just stick all over to everything so
[SPEAKER_02]: all right it's uh it might be up in one of
my one of my posts on my feed um i know i
[SPEAKER_02]: did a time lapse of the melt itself but um
i did a live feed a couple weeks back i
[SPEAKER_07]: saw it it was great i just can't find it
on your thing right now yeah i'm not sure
[SPEAKER_07]: if i say there's four there's like high
times baller jars clear domes yeah i might
[SPEAKER_11]: not have posted on that part i think i
saved it to my phone so i could eventually
[SPEAKER_07]: put it up on uh youtube oh yeah okay
because i would have screenshot it and and
[SPEAKER_07]: shown it but yeah it's pretty damn cool i
mean you could give them the the quick uh
[SPEAKER_02]: breakdown yeah i mean it's pretty i mean
it are we talking about the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: separation process or just the diamond
part yeah i don't know do you do thca
[SPEAKER_08]: separation d uh no i haven't but uh i'd
love to hear the whole process with thc
[SPEAKER_08]: separation and the diamonds if you if you
want to share it brother yeah i mean i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't i don't really mind at this point i
mean if you if if everybody could look at
[SPEAKER_02]: my feed essentially i mean because the
amount of people that i follow a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people are starting to to pick up on it so
i mean everyone's going from uh covert
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts up i think he's up in michigan to
uh people on the east coast and southwest
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere start everybody's starting to
slowly pick up on the the separation
[SPEAKER_08]: process nice to see you uh do you have a
youtube channel under the same name yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: rackham's rodin okay there's not much on
there right now but there are a few videos
[SPEAKER_02]: uh mechanical separation videos will be
coming up shortly and do you have a do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a youtube brother yeah it's rackham's
rodin same thing yeah because if you do a
[SPEAKER_07]: video i can help you get a bunch of
exposure by posting it and linking it to
[SPEAKER_02]: your account yeah definitely i definitely
want to do a proper time lapse educational
[SPEAKER_02]: video and not just something of me fucking
off you know yeah totally be great i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially the the mechanical separation
process is taking perfectly good rosin and
[SPEAKER_02]: separating it into two two fractions i
mean it's when it comes down to it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really a consistency thing and a look
thing that's all there is aside from that
[SPEAKER_02]: people you give the you give a patient
more opportunity to adjust the the dose of
[SPEAKER_02]: thca or thc to its turp profile so if they
don't want as much turps you can they can
[SPEAKER_02]: you not use as much of the turp fraction
or vice versa with the with the thca
[SPEAKER_02]: fraction what is that correct yes it's
thca it hasn't converted over yet yeah i
[SPEAKER_08]: understand so go ahead so getting the
getting the you're basically taking rosin
[SPEAKER_08]: and repressing it and getting thc out of
it and then turps sauce yeah so it depends
[SPEAKER_02]: on the rodin itself so if you take a 10
gram slab of rosin and it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of shattery and snap and pull that
would work that would work so if it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't butter up the buttering up quote
unquote process is is what you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for if it doesn't do that that's that's
the conversion of the actual thca
[SPEAKER_02]: crystallizing within the rosin under my
assumption so if it doesn't if that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't happen in your rosin stays snap
and pull and shattery consistency it won't
[SPEAKER_02]: ever crash quote unquote or or separate
under the correct so it has to butter up
[SPEAKER_03]: i'd take therefore it has to have enough
terpene content for it to actually get to
[SPEAKER_08]: that stage that's what i'd say this slab
and repress it then right yep you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: use like a 25 micron or smaller screen um
only the main reason is to hold back that
[SPEAKER_02]: crystallization form of thca in the bag
and allow the turps to flow out serious
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge being dropped on the on the on
the world right now i i've been doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: for the past the fractions are what what's
allows you to really get really artful
[SPEAKER_03]: with it and i think that's that's the
exciting part about it and um you know i
[SPEAKER_03]: just checked out your instagram what
you're doing there rackham's is amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: it's beautiful so you get it darren you
get the wrapping the rosin in a like 25
[SPEAKER_07]: micron or smaller screen and then doing
this super light low temp press yep yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: they call it like a purse percy press
they've heard that used yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially want to you want to bring the
plate down um like a hand pump would be
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal because you can actually control you
know the pressure of it um a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously have pneumatics and whatnot but
i use a hand pump always have and always
[SPEAKER_02]: will uh it's just i like to feel the
pressure but when when you're initially
[SPEAKER_02]: starting your process you want to have
your plates anywhere between like 100
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees fahrenheit or possibly lower
depending on how um how viscous the rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: is um if it's more of like a crumbly wax
then you can bump up the heat a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: higher but i usually start around 100 100
fahrenheit or around what's that 40 ish 43
[SPEAKER_07]: celsius um i started on there sorry when
you said when he said this go ahead deep
[SPEAKER_11]: the terpene profiles of the cannabis or
the resin and then after you've made rosin
[SPEAKER_11]: analyzed it i'm wondering are the ratios
of monoturpenes changing do you know they
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly are i haven't had testing to
confirm that so i don't quote me on that
[SPEAKER_02]: but they very well possibly are because
you're reinjecting heat back into that
[SPEAKER_03]: this whole process so sam they they have
to be they have to be changing based on on
[SPEAKER_03]: the just on science you know i mean
monoturpenes all have a different yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: different range i just didn't want to make
any assumptions yeah yeah no no doubt no
[SPEAKER_08]: doubt how long do you press that for on
the low temp with the hand pressed so now
[SPEAKER_02]: here's the thing it all depends like
obviously within the solvent this game we
[SPEAKER_02]: have very very many variables we all know
that um with with this process it depends
[SPEAKER_02]: on how much you're pressing if you're just
pressing a couple of grams i mean the
[SPEAKER_02]: first press could easily allow you to to
be done within 40 45 minutes but if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: pressing a half zip or an ounce or or more
that's going to take you quite some time
[SPEAKER_02]: to get all the that terp fraction slowly
removed from the process so my process i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: usually doing about a half ounce or more i
use my initial press can be anywhere from
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour to 90 minutes at around 80 to 100
degrees fahrenheit wow yeah that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: the first press and i based that off of
once again phil and other people that i've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen that have made comments along the way
you know through the progression of this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole process saying that yeah my first
press is at 90 minutes you know for such
[SPEAKER_02]: and such temperature and i did the exact
same reactions like are you shitting me
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just like you're you're you're are
you timing it along the way where you give
[SPEAKER_08]: it a press like with your hand and so so
do you do so how what what's your space
[SPEAKER_08]: between your press half press full press
yeah so initially what i do is i bring the
[SPEAKER_02]: plate the top plate down to the bag and
the parchment and just make it so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: snug just no really absolutely no pressure
just enough to hold the bag there and
[SPEAKER_02]: start the start the crystallization
process or speed it up so to speak because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what's already happening when your
rosin is buttering in itself so
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially you're putting it in the press
to to force this to happen a lot sooner
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a lot of people with the new jar
tech it's pretty much what they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: they're causing their rosin to crash in a
different way a lot sooner than it would
[SPEAKER_02]: have normally just sitting out okay but
the first press is usually around like
[SPEAKER_02]: i'll start it and then around 20 minutes
to a half hour i'll uh at least nowadays
[SPEAKER_02]: i've been bumping up the pressure a little
bit obviously starts it's starting to flow
[SPEAKER_02]: things are starting to change it's
starting to sweat is what i like to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it i'll bring the pressure down a little
or up a little bit not much but like a
[SPEAKER_02]: half a pump or so just to kind of keep it
moving flowing and then i'll bump up the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature about every half hour to 45
minutes i'll bump it up a few two degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is also once again the slow
process for like if you have a rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency initially starting out that's
kind of like more of a sugary butter
[SPEAKER_02]: that's more malleable and not so crumbly
like a wax consistency if it's if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like a thick peanut butter but
still has those crystal like sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency inside the rosin that'll work
but it's going to take a lot longer
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's going to want to be forced
out of the bag which which will cause
[SPEAKER_02]: issues in the long run for your turf
fraction so then to get the end game here
[SPEAKER_02]: is to to pretty much hold back that single
connect cannabinoid in the bag as long as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and allow everything else to flow
out okay and then before i was using
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple presses i was using uh not
multiple presses but i was i was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple presses with uh multiple wraps
and things like that but now i've come to
[SPEAKER_02]: find out that i just leave it wrapped in
my single or double wrapped uh 25 micron
[SPEAKER_02]: or smaller for the whole time period some
of my presses last six to seven hours
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what i do oh wow but the
initial point you you want like very
[SPEAKER_02]: little pressure and you ramp up everything
just like if you're pressing rosin like
[SPEAKER_02]: normal but your this repress process you
want low pressure low heat and gradually
[SPEAKER_02]: ramp up over the course of obviously a
couple hours if you're pressing more than
[SPEAKER_08]: a half zip or or an ounce perfect with low
pressure low heat long time yeah you just
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty much do you prefer uh fresh frozen
material to have a higher terpene content
[SPEAKER_02]: or definitely in this process from my
experience i mean i've i've done mostly uh
[SPEAKER_02]: dry cured bud hash rosin so to speak but i
have done live rosin my recent post if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at my diamond formations they're all
from uh made from whole plant fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_02]: live rosin the turf the turf profile is
definitely a lot more in your nose so to
[SPEAKER_02]: speak with live rosin compared to hash
rosin but that's obviously because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cure point the the cure factor they're
they're not being one and marcus my my
[SPEAKER_11]: favorite rosin some of them have been made
from uh dry sifted or water sifted uh
[SPEAKER_11]: heads i'm wondering is there a way to
completely knock off all of the residue
[SPEAKER_11]: from a fresh plant that's frozen or
something i just i mean i've heard about
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the nitrogen tech where but that
grinds up every it pulverizes everything
[SPEAKER_11]: not only the uh the resin and i'm trying
to keep the the resin head intact but
[SPEAKER_11]: liberated from the frozen mass i'm just
trying to figure out a way yeah i haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: seen anything that extracts in pure form
and the problem with getting a
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminated product with like a dry ice
or a nitrogen is that you end up with this
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminated very fresh sort of you know
head that's willing to butter you know the
[SPEAKER_07]: head has got moisture in the wax membrane
it has not been dried and cured and and
[SPEAKER_07]: therefore you would really need to figure
out a way quickly i guess maybe right into
[SPEAKER_07]: a freeze dryer and then you know once all
the moisture is removed from it you could
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially do a variety of things but uh
that's seemingly creating a lot of stages
[SPEAKER_02]: to uh that has been a new thing that
people have been doing people have been
[SPEAKER_02]: putting their their fresh not fresh frozen
but fresh uncured bud bucked down into
[SPEAKER_02]: into freeze dryers and freeze drying it
yeah and they're smoking it right out
[SPEAKER_02]: right out of the freeze dryer like
instantly and instead of some of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing smoke they've done now i've been
curious about washing freeze dried uh bud
[SPEAKER_02]: i have yet to try it but i'm going to
probably experiment so you know i think
[SPEAKER_07]: this is really cool that what you're
sharing but also the conversation because
[SPEAKER_07]: you know since you've been talking there's
been at least three or four people just
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of like in the chat room who just
it's kind of like their shit doesn't stink
[SPEAKER_07]: is how they're acting and just mocking oh
six or seven oh oh oh kind of like that
[SPEAKER_07]: and in the meantime it's like you know
it's people like yourself and soil grown
[SPEAKER_07]: and people who are willing to experiment
and play around that will make the next
[SPEAKER_07]: great discoveries that these same
motherfuckers will be enjoying um in six
[SPEAKER_07]: months from now so it's just funny to see
how it plays out where you get people like
[SPEAKER_07]: just kind of mocking belittling talking
down i'm just like oh yeah it's just it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's gonna happen but let's let's
understand the point that like everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that i'm speaking here isn't isn't law you
know this is just something that i've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned along the way that works for me
i'm not trying to preach this as as like
[SPEAKER_02]: uh scripture or anything like that if
something if you can alter what i present
[SPEAKER_02]: to you in a better form in a faster form
more power and people have done that like
[SPEAKER_02]: covert for example you look up covert
extracts he was able to get his a i think
[SPEAKER_02]: converted over in less than an hour and
it's it's it's clearer than mine so he's
[SPEAKER_02]: extracting more turp more turps than than
i am and he hasn't shared his tech which i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't blame him for to a certain extent
but everything that i've learned up until
[SPEAKER_02]: this point nobody's told me i'm doing
wrong so if it seems to help somebody else
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm i'm just going to keep sharing it the
way that i've been so people need to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that that this isn't like the
be all end all way that i really love
[SPEAKER_08]: about the industry is that every time
something new is is introduced there's
[SPEAKER_08]: always i'm sit back and i think what's
next because there's always something next
[SPEAKER_08]: it was the you know the the pure dry sift
and then the and then the uh the rosinning
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff like that and now this part of
it and six seven hours i'm like i'm
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking to myself that was a big one both
both bho and water hash were made public
[SPEAKER_07]: to one another well i'm sure on a lower
level they were both made public to people
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout in a very small way but how in
1999 is when if i released water hash like
[SPEAKER_07]: to the masses it had already existed on a
smaller level but started getting it out
[SPEAKER_07]: posting it on overgrown cannabis culture
and cannabis world and all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: different forums and then the butane came
along in the same way and it just spread
[SPEAKER_07]: like wildfire and i'm telling you i i
remember being around during that time
[SPEAKER_07]: where you know not a lot of people had
good hash in 96 97 98 but i'll tell you 99
[SPEAKER_07]: 2000 2001 it was happening more and more
and more and it's been happening
[SPEAKER_07]: consistently since then more and more and
more like some people that are new to this
[SPEAKER_07]: have come in at a high level of the
industry but don't understand how only 20
[SPEAKER_07]: or so years ago there was so many less
people actually playing around and making
[SPEAKER_07]: hash and it was in that experimenting and
in that you know experience of like having
[SPEAKER_07]: material to play with and make hash and
make dry sift and create water hash and
[SPEAKER_07]: learn new ways to dry it and press it wet
and make mistakes all of those mistakes
[SPEAKER_07]: led us to where we are today so when you
think someone's doing something stupid
[SPEAKER_07]: with cannabis and you think they're making
a big mistake you would do best to thank
[SPEAKER_08]: them instead of mock them my two cents and
and right now i just wanted to tell you
[SPEAKER_08]: thank you for sharing our sharing that
with us as well awesome thanks yeah and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah from my perspective guys it's kind of
like music you know music is very fluid
[SPEAKER_03]: and and if you bring a rigidness to that
just like you bring a rigidness to science
[SPEAKER_03]: and exploration you're just you're just
gonna you're gonna be bitter all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: man it's just there's so many wonderful
things out there embrace it yeah i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the one reason that i kind of
continue with doing this uh this
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical separation process initially i
was like a lot of other people like really
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck's the point of this like
you're ruining perfectly good rockin but
[SPEAKER_02]: then i i realized that one there's a
demand for it people wanted it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: two it was starting to become really
intriguing just the whole process behind
[SPEAKER_02]: it and i felt like how i was just thinking
in my brain how can i refine this process
[SPEAKER_02]: even more like how far can we take this
that's mainly what my and my main goal was
[SPEAKER_02]: to see how far i could take it and i mean
i don't know i don't know how much farther
[SPEAKER_02]: we can take it like once you used to
separate the tta from from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids i mean how far how much
farther can you take it and another
[SPEAKER_02]: question is is can you separate other
cannabinoids at certain temperatures
[SPEAKER_03]: that's my next experiment yeah absolutely
you can and that's that's exactly what i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: saying like keep going because honestly
you know it's it's about that exploration
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to find you in that in that
place that you're standing alone and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be like holy oh my god
look at this as somebody who has smoked
[SPEAKER_11]: all of the major cannabinoids and all of
the major turkeys i can tell you what you
[SPEAKER_11]: want for recreational purposes medical is
much much broader but for recreational
[SPEAKER_11]: purposes you want the right combination of
terpenes that affects the way you want the
[SPEAKER_02]: modulation and potentiation and that's why
i like doing this separation because then
[SPEAKER_02]: you can you can change the the actual
percentage or quote-unquote the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene that you want to introduce into
your quote-unquote high before you do that
[SPEAKER_11]: just by smoking different kinds of
cannabis but yes you can do that and uh
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah i mean thc or thca if you're going to
smoke it i'm not sure there's so much
[SPEAKER_11]: difference because thca gets converted to
thc by the act of vaping it or of course
[SPEAKER_07]: it's thc and the terpenes yes well i will
be honest i did see it all you had all
[SPEAKER_07]: those major cannabinoids you had like cbg
and you had cbn and you had thca and you
[SPEAKER_07]: had you had like 10 of them or something
in little jars and you had terpenes as
[SPEAKER_07]: well and that was crazy for me because
that was like 2000 2001 and i was like man
[SPEAKER_07]: i'd never seen anything like that i was
really just like just started extracting
[SPEAKER_07]: heads with water and ice i was feeling
pretty good about that then i'm like over
[SPEAKER_07]: at sam's place going damn like the rabbit
hole goes way deeper than i thought like
[SPEAKER_07]: this is some fucking crazy shit like i
started on this little rock and then i
[SPEAKER_07]: jumped off i was like oh that's a big jump
and then sam was like here jump with me
[SPEAKER_07]: and we jumped into the grand canyon
[SPEAKER_08]: now to get the rosin that you're going to
be repressing for that length of time what
[SPEAKER_08]: do you press flour live fresh frozen
bubble hash or cured bubble hash and what
[SPEAKER_08]: did you what do you do with that is it a
long low temp press as well so you get the
[SPEAKER_08]: butter out or what's your process with
that to make the rosin you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: separating on the next press um so are you
talking about the initial rosin and the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of rosin that you that we're going to
be repressing yes and the starting
[SPEAKER_02]: material you use your choices yeah so i
mean as far as compared for a lot i've had
[SPEAKER_02]: this question a lot so flower rosin dry
sift rosin hash rosin live whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh rosin rosin doesn't matter as long
as it butters up i i tend to let my my
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin butter up on its own um you'll see a
lot of people see me do that taffy tech
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit like kind of uh whipping it and
pulling it all that is is to bring my
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin straight off the press into the same
consistency or one even consistency and
[SPEAKER_02]: then i allow it to sit a lot of people are
calling that cold cure now which is just
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving it at a room temperature cure um
with parchment tepid over it i allow it to
[SPEAKER_02]: do its own thing and convert because then
i know it's going to work properly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: press for the repress process if it
doesn't convert on its own stays battery
[SPEAKER_02]: and and clear so to speak then it won't
work and that's kind of how i gauge it
[SPEAKER_11]: also another another have you ever had a
clone the same clone where you made it
[SPEAKER_11]: frozen you made it dry sift you made it
from the bud you made it from the from the
[SPEAKER_11]: resin water syringe or whatever so that
you can try to eliminate some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: variables and understand more what's in
other words is there a specific process or
[SPEAKER_11]: is it all up to the variety why some
butters and why i think it's all based on
[SPEAKER_02]: the thca percentage or thca content
whether that's in the flower or the rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: however you want to put it it's all
determined on that in my eyes i'm not 100
[SPEAKER_02]: sure but that's just what i've noticed a
flower with a higher uh thca percentage in
[SPEAKER_02]: it will more likely guarantee you a more
buttered rosin like this in labs to assure
[SPEAKER_11]: yourself of that i have not because when
even when we use dry cannabis it's still
[SPEAKER_11]: by far more than 95 96 97 percent thca
yeah and that's a good candidate right
[SPEAKER_02]: there that once you press that into rosin
form if that rosin still contains that
[SPEAKER_02]: high thca percentage you're more likely
guaranteed that you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: separate it or with the jar tech make it
crash so like i i did a lemon tree for
[SPEAKER_11]: example cannabis products frozen dried or
whatever are in fact in the form of thca
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis i'm talking about that's what our
lab work consistently showed for years
[SPEAKER_02]: that and i agree with that definitely you
just said jar cure what's that the jar
[SPEAKER_02]: tech the jar tech is a a new process as
well a lot of the kids are getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays it's just another form of
consistency that's all it is now i do i
[SPEAKER_02]: can mention that there have been reports
of terpene percentages upping with jar
[SPEAKER_02]: with jar tech not much but a noticeable
amount if you go shout out to rosna rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: ryan ryan rosin from colorado yeah um i
think he works with the olio team i can't
[SPEAKER_02]: can't quite remember but the one that
noted showed uh actual lab results of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene percentages upping in their
percentages from the raw the rosin in its
[SPEAKER_02]: original state to the rosin after the jar
tech but that's a whole nother ball game
[SPEAKER_03]: in my eyes yeah that's the heating and
then reheating and mat heating and then
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah it's the bho tech i mean pretty much
but that's that's the tech i i enjoy that
[SPEAKER_03]: tech to be honest i i wish i knew more i
think it's i think there's something to
[SPEAKER_03]: that for a specific angle well there's
storage purposes do they last longer on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelf i mean yeah it helps with shelf
life and it also helps with cart cartridge
[SPEAKER_03]: filling man i mean if you're looking for
that end goal um and i i look at all these
[SPEAKER_03]: processes and processes like what are you
trying to do with it right like out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin press you can make you know rosin
ready to be sold at a gram but if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to put it in a cartridge or you want to
have it in a more viscous form for let's
[SPEAKER_03]: say you want to mix it with salt with
diamonds you know there it just depends on
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're trying to do and the
consistencies really help like it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: paint you know if you want to paint with a
certain uh you know consistency you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to use a thinner paint you know if
you're going to have thicker you can use
[SPEAKER_03]: oil and that's what i look at the all of
these consistencies like and i think what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're saying really falls in line with
that where you know if you're heating it
[SPEAKER_03]: at 200 or for you know 60 minutes or less
then you're you're going to hit those
[SPEAKER_03]: consistencies but it's all cult goes back
to what sam was kind of alluding to it's
[SPEAKER_03]: all cultivars specific in the way that
that kind of does like kind of works is
[SPEAKER_03]: really individual to how that was kind of
even goes back to the grow you know so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's the thing about it every time
it's the same same argument every time
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just that variable there's so many
variables all the way back to the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and even how the grower grew that plant no
doubt yeah so that's what i've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: personally is that it's like if you can
get consistency and start working with
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars that you know really deeply and
have a very deep understanding of it can
[SPEAKER_03]: be your your your canvas you know um and
then that's what that's you know that's
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting you know i wanted to uh bring up
a a quick topic back to like the fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen process i know a lot of people are
kind of having the conversations as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: uh cure points and things like that with
fresh rose and kind of the rule of thumb
[SPEAKER_02]: that i've been under the assumption of is
uh like cutting down your plants within
[SPEAKER_02]: four hours and getting them frozen within
four hours is kind of your quote-unquote
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant fresh frozen but i'm wondering
if people have been talking about amongst
[SPEAKER_02]: yourselves uh like a two a one or two or
three day low temp cure on flower and then
[SPEAKER_02]: freezing it to kind of burn off some of
those more volatile turps um even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna get burned off anyways i'm
curious what you guys think about that
[SPEAKER_02]: because i just ran a crop i just took five
plants i let them cure for about two days
[SPEAKER_02]: at 65 degree with a slightly higher or
about 60 temp uh 60 rh uh humidity and
[SPEAKER_02]: then i bucked them down and froze them i
haven't washed them yet but i'm curious to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what people think about that process
or if that's even worth it i would almost
[SPEAKER_07]: guarantee that in some cases it will be
worth it and in other cases it won't got
[SPEAKER_07]: you will find a sweet spot for certain
plants and certain genetics and depending
[SPEAKER_07]: on this insane amount of variables that i
couldn't even pretend to to list off that
[SPEAKER_07]: could that could affect that that could
you know where it's just certain cultivars
[SPEAKER_07]: the terpene profile whatever it is when
there's too much moisture when it's frozen
[SPEAKER_07]: it just has a taste that it doesn't have
when you cure it out longer because i
[SPEAKER_03]: you're muted dude you're muted buddy was i
muted the whole time no just just for a
[SPEAKER_07]: moment i was like you guys were really
kind of listening when i was anyway i said
[SPEAKER_07]: i liked where he was going with the
conversation and that i haven't done a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of sort of experimenting in that range of
like cold curing for four days versus 10
[SPEAKER_07]: days versus whatever versus freezing it
like right off the off the plant like
[SPEAKER_07]: within an hour or two um but i did do a
lot of dry material i used to make a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of dry material bubble like you know not
fresh frozen at all fresh frozen came a
[SPEAKER_07]: few years later and it's funny because the
reason i had no interest in making fresh
[SPEAKER_07]: frozen was because my hash already melted
into a liquid and dripped through the
[SPEAKER_07]: tightest of screens so it was you know
with that renee the terpene profile was so
[SPEAKER_07]: present even after water water hashing it
that it was just i mean it really was one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the main reasons that i think bubble
bags took off because i had this very
[SPEAKER_07]: unique access to this incredible cultivar
that just seemed to be made for the bags
[SPEAKER_07]: and i would consistently see and and for
me how i first got into it was i made some
[SPEAKER_07]: water hash with some isolator bags prior
to bubble bags existing about six months
[SPEAKER_07]: prior they were maybe a month old and i'm
i finally got some material from breeder
[SPEAKER_07]: steve it was the shishkeberry that washed
beautifully it was renee-esque in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sense that it just washed beautifully it
looked like caramel when it cured if you
[SPEAKER_07]: pressed it into a block it was just like a
caramel cube it was extremely extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: nice material to have access to uh but the
fresh frozen thing to me really started
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh frozen and microplaning were both
incredible ways to increase your chance of
[SPEAKER_07]: a multiple a melting product in the end
you know using something that was as fresh
[SPEAKER_07]: as possible to secure as many terpenes as
possible and shredding the head so that
[SPEAKER_07]: the oil was on the outside of the wax
membranes so when you held a flame to it
[SPEAKER_07]: you saw that little sizzle you saw that
little bit of melt and that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_07]: i thought that's what my perspective was
when i saw it first happening because here
[SPEAKER_07]: i was making stuff with very dry material
and it was so melty and so caramelly and
[SPEAKER_07]: it was basically the question i got all
the time was how do i make my hash look
[SPEAKER_07]: like yours and i was like i the grower
it's like it's all i did was isolate the
[SPEAKER_07]: heads you're using the same product to
isolate your heads it's the grower and the
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics that we need to uh that you need
to get a better relationship with so for
[SPEAKER_07]: me bubble bags were like a guiding light
along your pathway of learning about these
[SPEAKER_07]: things because it could show you when you
used material that wasn't grown properly
[SPEAKER_07]: that wasn't good enough it would show you
in the end results like oh why is my hash
[SPEAKER_07]: sandy why isn't it sticking together it's
like oh because you grew subpar pot or
[SPEAKER_07]: someone grew subpar genetics and didn't
grow it very well hey welcome welcome wade
[SPEAKER_00]: uh cheers sheroos sheroos i'm good i'm on
the i'm on hash church this morning oh i
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't think he was talking to us right
now i'll be right there guys awesome i
[SPEAKER_02]: could hear you i was like going back to
that fresh frozen though so i'm under i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: under the assumption that when we first
when we first cut down our plants those
[SPEAKER_02]: heads and i'm speaking of and thinking
about the heads in particular like the
[SPEAKER_02]: heads are really soft and and malleable in
a sense that they're they're not they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't had a chance to actually the wax
membrane build a solid coating or a
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation with the cure correct um say
that again they're like the the fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen heads compared to cured cured bud
heads the fresh frozen heads are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a lot softer the wax membrane not as
rigid as say a cured bud correct am i am i
[SPEAKER_07]: i would think that you're talking about
the cured heads the wax membrane yeah i
[SPEAKER_07]: would assume it would be harder than
softer when it was cured that it was that
[SPEAKER_07]: it would be softer when it was fresh that
it would have moisture in it and then it
[SPEAKER_11]: was you know it's absolutely true because
the same variety when it's growing on the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant sometimes the the resin almost feels
oily exactly for a week or two and it
[SPEAKER_11]: feels uh really greasy then you think
about like a grape you dry it even more
[SPEAKER_11]: and it turns in from a grape to a resin
yeah so that i bring that up because going
[SPEAKER_11]: back to the cure process what's that sound
i said then they can be worked with and
[SPEAKER_11]: handled easily when they're dry correct so
i'm trying to find that happy medium
[SPEAKER_02]: between the fresh frozen and the cures
point that's why i'm trying to do like a
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three day low temp cure because i
feel like in my head that those those
[SPEAKER_02]: resin heads the wax membrane will will
that that just a couple days will allow
[SPEAKER_02]: that to kind of solidify and also keep
that turf profile of the fresh frozen to a
[SPEAKER_11]: certain extent that's also the reason why
you want varieties when you grow them that
[SPEAKER_11]: are so damn terpene rich loud yeah because
after you've dried them and you've cured
[SPEAKER_11]: it for three months in a box it's it's
like a raisin but it's still really
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene rich inside that wax beautiful
ain't that the truth yeah i'll tell you
[SPEAKER_07]: the first time i smoked sam's hash and it
was just bone dry and it was just like i
[SPEAKER_07]: was just like how is this gonna have any
taste it was like a flavor explosion in my
[SPEAKER_07]: mouth and it was the highest i ever got in
the shortest amount of time like instantly
[SPEAKER_07]: i was just like wow like i am home this is
how the sam hers diesel is for me the sam
[SPEAKER_02]: hers diesel from a humbled cedar
organization holy shit it's i thought i
[SPEAKER_02]: originally thought it was a cantaloupe
kush it's like on the on the vine so to
[SPEAKER_02]: speak on the stock it smells like a ripe
cantaloupe and it's uh amherst sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: so i'm not sure what the cross is exactly
but that's what i have here with the two
[SPEAKER_02]: three day cure on it i've done a full two
week cure and i've done it fresh frozen so
[SPEAKER_11]: now this is my middle experiment we know
that all the processing curing and
[SPEAKER_11]: everything of course it changes the
terpene profile because oh yeah obvious
[SPEAKER_11]: easy example is think how much it changes
the last week or two before you harvest it
[SPEAKER_07]: yep it gets into that old school versus
new school and i remember i i can't
[SPEAKER_07]: remember his name now he had a seed
company it's crazy that i can't remember
[SPEAKER_07]: his name dutch no he was an american tony
what was tony's company's name sagamarta
[SPEAKER_07]: yes correct okay sagamarta so i'm puffing
with tony in amsterdam some years back
[SPEAKER_07]: i've got this like beautiful sweet skunk
like you know the herb was cured and dried
[SPEAKER_07]: for months and then the hash was cured and
dried for months and it was just this like
[SPEAKER_07]: light powder and i had it in amsterdam and
i was puffing it with everyone but i
[SPEAKER_07]: puffed it with him and he took a big hit
he blew it out and he was just like about
[SPEAKER_07]: five minutes later he just said dude what
was that and i was like oh it was some
[SPEAKER_07]: some sweet skunk dry sift and he's like
he's like man it's the first thing i've
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked in like nine days that just didn't
explode like make me cough so horribly
[SPEAKER_07]: like just razor blades in my throat and i
was like yeah like when you when you cure
[SPEAKER_07]: out those lighter terpenes those those
first batch that that are just they're
[SPEAKER_07]: just harsh which just seems to be what
nowadays the younger people are wanting
[SPEAKER_07]: they want all of it fresh frozen live
living in the plants smoking it so they're
[SPEAKER_07]: just like turning red and coughing and i'm
i've been on both sides so i i see it but
[SPEAKER_07]: i really appreciated tony seeing it and
appreciating it and saying man i'm telling
[SPEAKER_07]: you that was like the most enjoyable thing
i've smoked all week just like that's
[SPEAKER_07]: what's up some nice cured resin that
doesn't like you know it's just like
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes you just want to have a nice a
nice rep once again it's a quiver for me
[SPEAKER_07]: i'm i don't want to get sucked into one or
the other with cannabis i want to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to allow everyone within my own judgments
to just enjoy all of it to be be having
[SPEAKER_07]: fun with it you're having fun with
cannabis great you're playing around and
[SPEAKER_07]: experimenting awesome you know consume
your own experiments don't sell them on
[SPEAKER_07]: the open market but other than that i
think you know like when you're doing like
[SPEAKER_07]: chemical experiments and stuff like uh uh
Horatio used to be doing the delimiting i
[SPEAKER_07]: was always like you know like for a long
time he didn't release that stuff it was
[SPEAKER_07]: like more like yeah yeah just consume your
own experiments until you figure out the
[SPEAKER_07]: first mistakes you were making and then
once you've got that taken care of now let
[SPEAKER_07]: the general public check it out
[SPEAKER_07]: yep that's what's up fucking great
conversation today everyone couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: hours burned not too bad at all i enjoyed
it i think uh i think we'll cut it here
[SPEAKER_07]: but maybe plan oh no wade's back we got to
do some more time for wade are you hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: with us this time wade vivetta county i am
uh having trouble figuring out why my uh
[SPEAKER_00]: device won't let y'all see what i'm doing
this morning but i can talk good morning
[SPEAKER_07]: good morning we were just i was just about
to wrap up hash church you came back in
[SPEAKER_07]: and then i was like we're going again it's
like the lifeline of the show has been
[SPEAKER_07]: pumped right back in oh thank you we want
to hear from you man what have you been up
[SPEAKER_00]: to how are things going uh things are
pretty exciting here in nevada county
[SPEAKER_00]: still uh trying to figure out what to do
about the fact that governor brown vetoed
[SPEAKER_00]: the compassionate use act which has been a
real focus of our activity for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years right a ridiculous thing
it is a ridiculous thing and i uh quite
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly uh what i what i and the other
folks that are helping forest are doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: uh we haven't really stopped doing what we
were doing we just uh can't believe i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying this on a show like this but we're
being more discreet about it you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be you can't stop doing what you guys are
doing what you guys are doing is so
[SPEAKER_02]: instrumental to this industry in a whole
even if it's a small thing you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: enforced are are fucking amazing and you
guys cannot stop yeah you guys are doing
[SPEAKER_07]: the right the good it's it's the right
thing you're on the you're on the right
[SPEAKER_07]: side of it so no matter what happens to me
it's just like okay well i guess a deeper
[SPEAKER_07]: level of civil disobedience is now
required yes yes well after years of uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know breaking unjust laws to use a
phrase i'd kind of gotten used to trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out how to obey the rules and
how to go along with regulators and
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities and whatnot and it's uh it's
just been a real strong lesson that uh in
[SPEAKER_00]: the law of unintended consequences because
particularly for us put an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of work into getting 829 through
the legislature last year and then to have
[SPEAKER_00]: it vetoed like that was really messed up
but who the fuck knows such a thing like
[SPEAKER_07]: who what is that like satan just like came
up from hell and was like i'm gonna veto
[SPEAKER_00]: this bill well i'll tell you i uh business
all i can come up with all i can come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with is that uh the folks who are charged
with doing the regulations in california
[SPEAKER_00]: uh had no way to deal with the idea that
there were people out there who were
[SPEAKER_00]: giving cannabis away when um the law is
very clear uh in california at least you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't give cannabis away even personal use
cannabis you can't give it away wow so
[SPEAKER_07]: that sucks dude we can give cannabis away
up to an ounce just give it away give it
[SPEAKER_00]: away give it away now well awesome it's
not the case in california if you're going
[SPEAKER_11]: to obey all the rules anyway uh in
california you can give less than an ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: to a friend not under personal use rules
sam uh the personal use uh when mersa as
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it the marijuana it was called the
marijuana and oh i don't remember it was
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2016 when the new set of laws in
california were enacted uh they talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about personal use and one of the things
is you can grow six personal use plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for your own use but you literally can't
give them to anyone else in your family
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't give it to your family to your
uh friends nothing that's what the law
[SPEAKER_00]: says of course that's not what's happening
but uh and my totally contrary to
[SPEAKER_11]: everything else we've been doing for the
because it's their marijuana as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: they just keep their mouth shut but we're
talking about children right now are we we
[SPEAKER_00]: are talking about children and we're not
talking about people who are getting an
[SPEAKER_11]: ounce of flowers we're getting uh so
there's no need to enforce it in fact if a
[SPEAKER_00]: person just says it's their marijuana true
a lot of what's going on that's true uh
[SPEAKER_00]: but particularly in the case of cases that
i'm talking about we're not uh we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: giving anybody trimmed flowers or or bags
of bud they're getting uh oils and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations formulations where we take uh
concentrated oils and mix them into other
[SPEAKER_00]: things to make products for the for their
needs basically you know uh so anyway it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a and we had a whole you know chain of
custody a whole group of folk who were
[SPEAKER_00]: helping this to happen and uh a lot of
them are trying to get permits and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this whole funny thing going on in
the work right now around trying to what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing at a local level and i
probably shouldn't say this as well there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a thing in california law that allows
for compassion gardens but local ordinance
[SPEAKER_00]: has to include it so uh we're working on
that front right now at the local level
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the state level uh um senate bill
37 is already in the books and uh working
[SPEAKER_00]: its way through committee i think it is
senate bill 37 which would basically
[SPEAKER_00]: reestablish the compassionate use program
so that's kind of where it's at at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment forest and i are um because of all
of this craziness forest and i have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually submitted an application in
nevada city to do uh the simplest form of
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing which would allow us to do
formulations and make some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've done in the legal framework
while working with other folks who are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal framework and uh it'll probably
be the end of this year before we have
[SPEAKER_00]: license and actually actually can operate
but we've started the process is that uh
[SPEAKER_02]: the simplest form so are you speaking of
like a type six or type or type seven with
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent based type six with uh uh just
formulations no extractions at all gotcha
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be reaching out to some of the folks
that have the manufacturing licenses in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to secure some of the oils that we
need we'll be working because even in
[SPEAKER_02]: nevada county there's uh there's not too
many people even allowed to to have those
[SPEAKER_02]: under my assumption right i mean as far as
uh manufacturing licenses and whatnot oh
[SPEAKER_02]: that's totally true uh i'm really close to
you so i can't wait to link up i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in plaster county oh dude well uh
who's
[SPEAKER_00]: that little guy behind me that's beautiful
uh speaking of children yeah um please
[SPEAKER_00]: marcus uh hook us up let's uh know
absolutely he'll bring his harry potter
[SPEAKER_02]: wand over sounds great yeah there might be
things that we can help each other on to
[SPEAKER_02]: get because i want to continue or help
continue that what you guys are doing as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as possible as far as veterans and
children i mean they need as much help as
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can offer so yeah true that true
that yeah the vets that's a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that yeah i don't want to
take up everybody's time but i heard a
[SPEAKER_00]: story the other day speaking of vets that
really was infuriating and it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: example of how the california regulated
market is working uh i met a guy a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of days ago he's a 100 disability from uh
wounds received in iraq uh his wife is 90
[SPEAKER_00]: disability for the same thing uh they have
a child who is uh challenged health-wise
[SPEAKER_00]: um and they live here in nevada county
they bought property uh long story short
[SPEAKER_00]: they applied for a permit um i haven't got
all the details but one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened is uh because yeah i don't want
to let's see anyway uh their property was
[SPEAKER_00]: recently reassessed for the improvements
they had made they still haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: their permit but meantime they've had to
shut down their operations their the
[SPEAKER_00]: valuation on their home went from 300 000
to almost 500 000 which meant their
[SPEAKER_00]: property taxes went up dramatically right
over time when they're trying to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the system and basically they're
considering they're looking at having to
[SPEAKER_00]: move sell their home and move because they
can't afford the property taxes for the
[SPEAKER_00]: place that they're in and these are 100
percent and 90 disabled veterans with a
[SPEAKER_00]: health challenge child basically being run
out of the market that's the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market is working in california
and a lot of it has to do with state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation and local jurisdictions local
jurisdictions have all kind of uh choice
[SPEAKER_00]: about how they want to treat cannabis your
city and county uh regulations or
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators are like the ones you got to
jump through first correct that's
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely right you have to get your
permit locally before you can even talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: the state so yeah so that's that's
different how they're they're approaching
[SPEAKER_03]: it out west than they are out in the east
coast in some respects i mean some states
[SPEAKER_03]: we call it to check the box date and then
you have to go the local component and um
[SPEAKER_03]: the other ones are just pitting you you
know blind tests you know which are are
[SPEAKER_03]: not healthy for anybody because people
that are unfit to be operating um with
[SPEAKER_03]: intentions that have nothing to do with
patients are the ones that are winning
[SPEAKER_03]: those license so it's um it's a
double-edged sword out there you know
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely so i see some see some show and
tell happening yeah my fucking camera
[SPEAKER_02]: sucks but i'm just trying to show the
before and after of what the diamonds kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of look like oh yeah hold it more in the
middle of the frame it's it's not just
[SPEAKER_07]: your camera that sucks it's your placement
that's seriously fucking off bring it up
[SPEAKER_07]: so time out that's your wands broken or
that's like crashed in the jar that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the one broken down so this is the
original rosin yeah uh it's a whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh rosin and then this end i wish i had
a flash on here but and then this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: turf fraction mixed with the thda crystals
or diamonds everyone's product right
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful love that amber so on that same
topic to you know i think marcus you and i
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about amber color versus clear color
versus caramel color versus everything i
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's been a conversation as well
um you know do you do we do we believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that clear uh rosin is a better superior
product over um aged amberheads i mean for
[SPEAKER_07]: me i just agree that if it is when i smoke
it then it is and if it isn't when i smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: it then it isn't i don't think i could
base anything right absolutely i think
[SPEAKER_03]: that color has nothing to do with quality
um well it is oxidization of thc sure um
[SPEAKER_11]: good but that said i prefer dried and
cured uh dry so then it can be good well
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly that's can i pop in here on the
issue of color please for most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations that we use uh we want the
full extract we don't want distillate uh
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate is really good at concentrating
certain cannabinoids and whatnot and i i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to get into try and talk to you
guys about that but um and i could be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong about this but our goal mostly uh in
securing oils that we use for the kids uh
[SPEAKER_00]: we want color uh we want as much of the
original chemistry that was in that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible in the plants uh preparations
that we're offering well and there it is
[SPEAKER_07]: wade you guys are doing like serious like
real work and then generally where this
[SPEAKER_07]: light colored things come from has been
you know partially the experimentation
[SPEAKER_07]: once again which is great but also through
instagram hype where people just naturally
[SPEAKER_07]: seem to think and don't get me wrong i
give a like every time i see any type of
[SPEAKER_07]: hash whether it's light dark or in between
sometimes when i have the variety i smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: the lighter one first and other times i
smoke the darker one first but uh i think
[SPEAKER_07]: it's it's part of this cannabis thing
where in in the long in the big picture
[SPEAKER_07]: there's always division but what you guys
are doing to me is separate from all that
[SPEAKER_07]: drama and it's it's real it represents a
real thing which is improving the quality
[SPEAKER_07]: of life of young sick children which is
how do you get realer than that yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's a special moment right there
come on yeah well thank you for that and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh we've just i i throw it out there
because there is i see
[SPEAKER_00]: i hear a lot of conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: uh it's just there's i think at least part
of what's going on is there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on in the cannabis plant in
addition to cbd and thc there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on and of course the turkeys
play a huge part in it uh and because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that's what it really boils
down to because we don't know what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on what we've worked with was what's
worked in the past and what's worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past is whole plant feco as i'm told
it's called full extract cannabis oil uh
[SPEAKER_00]: has a dark color it's somewhat tarry but
it comes um when it's clean it works
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really what it boils down to man we
can we give a child who's seizing uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong preparation and it's nothing that
doesn't do anything for them given the
[SPEAKER_00]: right preparation and in 15 or 20 seconds
the seizures stop
[SPEAKER_07]: right which now what you just said is how
they work in the brain and figure or even
[SPEAKER_07]: simply put figure out a formulations where
you know you find something that works if
[SPEAKER_07]: you can break down what that is you're
giving them into components you can
[SPEAKER_07]: recreate it with the same plants doing
your own extractions making sure that the
[SPEAKER_07]: ratios are identical every time because
these children have such a a sensitivity
[SPEAKER_07]: to any variation of cannabinoid and
terpene change that you could create the
[SPEAKER_07]: same thing for them every time so now they
don't ever have to you know worry that
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe is this the week that we're going to
get medicine that didn't have that same
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah that didn't have that same profile so
i see the value and the importance of both
[SPEAKER_07]: of them personally and i just can't be
divided in that i had the conversation i
[SPEAKER_07]: think it was with cc from eden laps she's
quite a proponent of full spectrum
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine as well which i am as well i just
also simultaneously argue for the
[SPEAKER_07]: importance of monomolecular isolates and
distillates as well also what is the full
[SPEAKER_11]: spectrum because the plant the
cannabinoids are not really dark in the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant it's when they've been degraded from
oxygen or storage or heat or light that's
[SPEAKER_11]: when they become dark so i mean i'm not
saying that a little bit of cbn isn't good
[SPEAKER_11]: for some patients i'm just saying that you
know full spectrum isn't for everybody
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe you know whatever your illnesses
probably determines what it is that's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to help you out of that exactly and
it won't just be a full spectrum it'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: a version of the full spectrum that once
was versus the footprints that are now
[SPEAKER_07]: present from all of those variables and
more that sam just mentioned so that's
[SPEAKER_07]: where the value comes into play that you
know these kids they cannot be we need to
[SPEAKER_07]: do that work we need to figure out the
ratios that are right for the right people
[SPEAKER_07]: and then to be able to create them
cannabis based derived so not going
[SPEAKER_07]: outside of cannabis to recreate the
profile but creating the profile from
[SPEAKER_07]: specific distillations and isolations that
you've created that you can now take and
[SPEAKER_07]: put together and create exactly what was
over here still cannabis derived not
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking genetically modified plastic weird
you know like you can also breed a variety
[SPEAKER_11]: of cannabis for any terpene or any
cannabinoid expression and if you grow in
[SPEAKER_11]: identical conditions every time it'll be
identical right that's a good point sam
[SPEAKER_03]: and and you know i love this conversation
because it it talks about how you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we're demystifying a lot of a lot of this
opinion and data really is as we're kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of talking about it what's right for use
so individual right now that we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: even flourish in that way and to really
you know get younger minds involved and
[SPEAKER_03]: and to take it to that place you know in
the years to come but it's you know i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sam i'm sure you've seen with with working
on your path you know great clear oil bad
[SPEAKER_11]: clear oil great brown oil and bad brown
oil here pure thc to my amazement and i
[SPEAKER_11]: found this out when uh must have been in
the early 90s yeah pure thc is clear it
[SPEAKER_11]: has no color whatsoever and it has a sort
of a thick oily texture kind of like super
[SPEAKER_11]: glue if you put a big drop of it on your
tongue and you rub it around it has no
[SPEAKER_11]: smell no taste i mean whatsoever it's it i
i every cannabis product the more
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrated it was it always had at least
a really bitter peppery taste on my tongue
[SPEAKER_02]: like honey oil i see that makes sense now
pure same with thca as well that has the
[SPEAKER_02]: same like same weird distinct even though
it's not supposed to have a taste or smell
[SPEAKER_02]: when you when you ignite thca just by
itself i've noticed that you get a weird
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct like aroma in your mouth and
taste even though you're not supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like it's specific to the but
there's a difference too what you're what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're producing probably have like sam
you're talking about lab grade thca yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: there will be the difference i would
almost guarantee would be in the fact that
[SPEAKER_07]: that little bit of extra that they're
getting out in the lab of terpenes of
[SPEAKER_07]: other things like you know would probably
make that difference for sure one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things i'd like to pop in here with is i
i'm fully in favor of the the pursuit of
[SPEAKER_00]: thc and thca in its purest forms i love it
very much myself for my own use but part
[SPEAKER_00]: of what i was trying to say here is that
in the search for fractions of the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry i'm just putting it out there to
not forget about or ignore all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going on to the in the
plant that seem to have a role in health
[SPEAKER_00]: as versus psychoactivity and thc of course
has a big role in health but i think most
[SPEAKER_00]: of us seek it for the psychoactive
experience and there's nothing wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychoactive experience we all love it
very much or we wouldn't be here but there
[SPEAKER_00]: are people who actually need the cannabis
plant and as as the leading researchers in
[SPEAKER_00]: this work that are actually doing the work
i just beg you to keep track of those
[SPEAKER_00]: other folks that really need this plant
really need it and some of the compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can make let's go about finding
them and isolating them and making them
[SPEAKER_00]: available much like what marcus was saying
but for the moment where we're at is yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we mostly work with full extract oils and
so much praise to all of you and anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's listening that's done the work of
finding the right genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating them and making them
available to the people who actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really need this plant because in fact
there are many of them and um yeah i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stop at that point and uh it's
time for me to have uh take a bond rip my
[SPEAKER_07]: mother right mother that's awesome oh i
wish i wish darren was in his seat for
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's gonna have to go back and watch
that oh my god that was great anyway yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: um like i said so much respect for what
you guys have done in in helping to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant into normal relations with the
world again and uh in that normalization
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm just saying there's some people who
really do need the plant and let's not
[SPEAKER_00]: forget them so ciao for now always but i'm
on mute well well said wade as always we
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate hearing from you and look at
this we're not done yet dr mark is in the
[SPEAKER_07]: house every time man listen just give us
25 minutes straight of baller chemistry
[SPEAKER_07]: drops and we'll call it a day i'm joking
please i would love that hi mark how are
[SPEAKER_01]: you doing you're back from romeca uh yeah
yeah i was uh i was uh there earlier in
[SPEAKER_01]: the week yep yeah i was actually just in
sacramento california yesterday so oh damn
[SPEAKER_11]: it nice because that means you'll be able
to close this evening with a reggae song
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful it was good it was good to see
you guys it was a pleasure talking with
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody thank you so much i'm out cheers
colin have a good one yeah i was wondering
[SPEAKER_02]: uh i wanted to ask mark a question about
the thc a um i know i've kind of done a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of research but haven't been
able to actually talk to you know an
[SPEAKER_02]: actual person who knows what the fuck
they're talking about um as far as uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation point of thca in
particular like that temperature point
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so you know thca will decarboxylate a
room temperature but it just does it very
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly of course so it's got a you know
first first uh order rate constant which
[SPEAKER_01]: means that the um the rate of
decarboxylation accelerates linearly with
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature yeah this is all been worked
out on a very uh very couple nice papers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are out there in the literature but
you'll find that like most cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: will readily start decarboxylating like
just above the oh no we'll get them back
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get them back or anyone who's about
to answer we lost you mark oh okay i was
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna say uh so decarboxylation readily
starts occurring right around the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of boiling water right okay so
that that's 100 degrees centigrade so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're up at like about 110 or 120 you're
really going to get decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring but um it it's all a matter of
uh you know how long you have to wait
[SPEAKER_01]: right yeah so the lower the temperature
just the longer the process occurs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fully completed gotcha yeah what what i
noticed is that when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylating especially cvd um it kind
of becomes uh almost uh almost like a coke
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it'll it'll fizz like a coca cola
right you'll just see that co2 come
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbling out of solution and there's
definitely an endpoint at which it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know no longer bubbles and uh yeah and
that's your visual point right so in that
[SPEAKER_07]: case then if it don't bubble it ain't
worth the trouble is the same for the
[SPEAKER_07]: decarboxylation of cbda as it is for full
melt hashes yeah that's gonna be my next
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment is uh trying to isolate the cbd
cbda um i haven't seen too many people try
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that was obviously it's it's not too
many people make cbd rosin or solventless
[SPEAKER_02]: but i think that's gonna be my next
experiment is trying to uh isolate cbd
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin and then isolate the cbda out of
that i'm curious if it'll if it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: crystallize the same way a thda does it
tends to be a lot more sappier doesn't it
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it is a lot more sappier i think
mike's got something to say on the subject
[SPEAKER_04]: mike west yeah so dr mark we were talking
earlier about uh i guess fractional
[SPEAKER_04]: extrusion of the terpene fractions out of
rosin using repressing yeah that's cool so
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of that would tends to happen
obviously we would want when you're when
[SPEAKER_04]: extruding the terpene fraction out of the
uh rosin that was pressed the first time
[SPEAKER_04]: you're probably going to want to keep the
uh plates on the terp uh rosin press below
[SPEAKER_04]: the melting point of the thca or cbda oh
of course right and then you know is it so
[SPEAKER_04]: mark i would ask you is the difference in
temperature that great that you could
[SPEAKER_04]: actually fractionate out the cbda i know i
primarily use fractionate with chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: or just yeah i i i don't think so mike i
think again those things are going to move
[SPEAKER_01]: around the same speed and i i'm not sure
that you can fractionate in in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: thermal extrusion kind of way but it's an
interesting thought because obviously i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean these things are just they're two
different chemical species so they behave
[SPEAKER_01]: very very differently and i think like our
our theory that we long ago proposed on
[SPEAKER_01]: past church which is that there's some
sort of uh steam involvement this
[SPEAKER_01]: involvement of the moisture that's in the
material itself that has nowhere to go but
[SPEAKER_01]: out is part of the the thermodynamic
driving force for basically moving the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the plant material right just
like the same way that you know uh waters
[SPEAKER_01]: or water builds up underneath the tire
when you hydroplane and there's nowhere
[SPEAKER_01]: for the car to go but just sort of in a
longitudinal direction so yeah i i would
[SPEAKER_01]: really think that again part of that could
be a fractionation mechanism where maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: what you do is you're getting in the
leading front the more volatile component
[SPEAKER_01]: i think the difference between thc and
cbda thca and cbda is still about you know
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 or 15 degrees but you know i think that
you could potentially um maybe leave uh
[SPEAKER_01]: leave leave the thc or i'm sorry leave the
cbda behind and push the thc out you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but i i don't know that anyone's actually
done that right or just use a cbd cultivar
[SPEAKER_07]: that has almost no thc in it yeah like a
pennywise or cherry walnut or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that exactly yeah that's what i'm
trying yeah there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about how do you make those those
oils less hot because that that hotness
[SPEAKER_01]: you know again the dirty secret is as yeah
you have 0.3 percent thc or below in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant but as soon as you concentrate that
oil the thc number goes through the roof
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's a lot of people who are trying
to figure this this out chromatography
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly works because the difference in
the polarity between cbda and thca is
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient enough that you can get a
decent separation on preparative
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatography so that seems to be the way
right now i thought what we'd find is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could somehow crystallize the thca and
leave the cbda behind but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to work out too well because again
cbd prefers to crystallize in an alkene
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm sorry go ahead cbd prefers to form
crystals as opposed to thc in an alkene
[SPEAKER_01]: well cbda is also a crystalline solid but
it's less crystalline than i think thca
[SPEAKER_01]: and i think part of the reason why is
because there's a you know a rotational
[SPEAKER_01]: degree of freedom in cbda because you you
unstitched that third that third ring
[SPEAKER_01]: right it's not a tricyclic structure it's
only a a bicyclic structure and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: rotational degrees of freedom there that
again makes it a little bit more onerous
[SPEAKER_02]: to crystallize so i'm wondering at a i'm
wondering at a lower temperature if you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to make that make that crash so to
speak under mechanical separation versus
[SPEAKER_07]: like the higher temperature with thca or
thermal extrusion as mark put it yeah i
[SPEAKER_01]: like that yeah so that's the uh the
technical term for rosin formation love it
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm using it yeah new hashtag i'd be
creative markets in an application that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were writing and they didn't like the word
rosin because it sounds like resin so we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to come up with a scientific term and
what we chose was uh thermal thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: extrusion under pressure that's awesome
what oh yeah okay you know and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: showed a picture of the pure of the pure
pressure unit so i think they got it right
[SPEAKER_11]: away beautiful making rosin that's nice
i've already copyrighted but we should
[SPEAKER_02]: call it shit i want to make sure everybody
knows too with the mechanical separation
[SPEAKER_02]: at least with my process i never go above
200 degrees fahrenheit ever uh very very
[SPEAKER_02]: very rarely except for my my final cleanup
presses when there's absolutely no turps
[SPEAKER_02]: left in the in the pouch i'll do like my
final steps which i didn't happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention we're using a paper or a coffee
filter organic coffee filter wrapped
[SPEAKER_02]: around the mesh of the thca and i'll be
around 180 to 190 doing really short hard
[SPEAKER_02]: presses at that point to excrete any
leftover turps that are still present but
[SPEAKER_02]: i very rarely allow the turp fraction to
ever get close to that 150 fahrenheit or
[SPEAKER_07]: higher and you were just experimenting
seeing it get wider and wider as you
[SPEAKER_07]: pulled it out knowing that what you were
doing made sense yep the coffee filter is
[SPEAKER_02]: an indication that because i use the
organic brown coffee filters so that's an
[SPEAKER_02]: indication when you first put it in there
and you're starting your cleanup process
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be really it'll look wet quote
unquote like it'll look like it's it's had
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid on it and you remove that you
replace that and you repeat the process
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll let it'll look less wet less wet and
get to the point where there's absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing left on the coffee filter then you
let me know you've you've excluded the
[SPEAKER_02]: turps as as far as you can essentially i
brought up a good point as far as uh
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature wise and i try to make sure
that people know that you don't ever need
[SPEAKER_02]: to get over you know 200 degrees
fahrenheit ever for this process but you
[SPEAKER_08]: start at uh 100 degrees yeah and and as as
you go as the time the six hour period you
[SPEAKER_08]: take the temperatures up how much
intervals up to that temperature i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's like like i said the initial
press is uh is about every half hour i'll
[SPEAKER_02]: bump it up and i i use my my machines in
celsius um it's not in fahrenheit but i
[SPEAKER_02]: bump up those numbers from like 40 to 45
in about 90 minutes and then after that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's about every 20 to 30 minutes i bump
it up a couple degrees each time until i
[SPEAKER_02]: get to about that point that it's around
170 to 180 fahrenheit i try to never
[SPEAKER_02]: repress my rosin higher than what i
pressed it initially if that makes sense
[SPEAKER_07]: so you you rock in celsius down in cali i
bought my plates from lid extraction in
[SPEAKER_07]: canada and they fucking hilarious dude
you're like the one american you're like i
[SPEAKER_07]: know what it means i know what that
temperature is i'm still working on it i
[SPEAKER_02]: have a graph sit next to my press the
whole entire every time i use it so oh my
[SPEAKER_11]: god because that shit's confusing
different consecutive presses are yielding
[SPEAKER_02]: different terpenes well the whole the
whole purpose for the the the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: change is just to to to slowly like
initially just to allow the thca to crash
[SPEAKER_02]: or convert into crystal form and then
after that is more of a more of a flow
[SPEAKER_02]: thing the hotter the plates get the more
the oil becomes hotter and more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: flowable so to speak so that's that's the
only reason for the temperature change i'm
[SPEAKER_11]: wondering if the more volatile terpenes
are being expressed first oh yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely those are because i'm sure mark
can can uh tell us that the most volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes burn off at like seventy sixty
five Fahrenheit oh yeah yeah yeah so those
[SPEAKER_02]: are already gone by the time you're you're
done or you're you're in this process
[SPEAKER_04]: what's pressing out at that temperature is
probably monoglycerides yeah other plant
[SPEAKER_01]: oils c5 i think isoprene's in there yeah i
wouldn't be able to tell for sure right it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes two isoprenes to make one of the
terpene right so ice cream is c5 and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene is c10 and again yeah mercine and
osamine and some of those real very
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive volatile volatile model terpenes
are probably undergoing some kind of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know thermal degradation reaction but
definitely volatilizing yep probably are
[SPEAKER_02]: almost guaranteed guaranteed degradation
for sure i mean let's be real it has to
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah well i think that's what the uh
the popcorn flavor ends up coming from is
[SPEAKER_07]: it now you know what i'll say that i've
only take i remember when rosin first came
[SPEAKER_07]: out and i was like taking pictures and
sharing it people like oh yeah burnt
[SPEAKER_07]: popcorn i was just like what are these
people talking about burnt popcorn i've
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked a lot of rosin i haven't smoked any
burnt popcorn and it wasn't and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_07]: until i think it might have been that
fucking press you did accidentally darren
[SPEAKER_07]: when we did the celsius fahrenheit mistake
which was what i laughed about earlier
[SPEAKER_07]: when darren was asking about temperatures
because i'll never forget this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: thing about celsius and fahrenheit it's as
confusing as fuck so i get my press from
[SPEAKER_07]: an american company and it's in fahrenheit
so when he asks me hey what temperature
[SPEAKER_07]: are you doing that at i'm like i'm like oh
like 200 or whatever like 190 210 and so
[SPEAKER_07]: he slaps this thing into celsius and
fucking goes up to 220 well dude i almost
[SPEAKER_07]: pissed myself it was spitting rosin out
like he said it was on his shoes it was on
[SPEAKER_07]: his fucking shirt dude i'm telling you we
had a fucking good laugh about that darren
[SPEAKER_07]: although that sucked in the sense that
that was the fucking a lot of of nice
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful product that got ruined but once
again experimenting right you got to learn
[SPEAKER_07]: this shit i felt bad i was just actually
following instructions exactly totally
[SPEAKER_08]: dude my my little gopro the lens that the
holder everything was all covered in rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: like he was just my first time i did the
same shit same shit oh yeah you did that
[SPEAKER_02]: too i well my first press i bought this
shitty ass uh pid controller that ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: being like i was pressing at 200 degrees
fahrenheit but in reality the pids were
[SPEAKER_02]: were pressing almost at 300 degrees
fahrenheit and i didn't it was not saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that on on the actual readout so i had no
fucking clue and we went to go press a
[SPEAKER_02]: half a zip of hash and sure enough it just
started spitting all over the place this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the very first press and my my buddy my
who was who was going to be my partner in
[SPEAKER_02]: this literally that day said nope and then
i'm not doing this like he was over it
[SPEAKER_11]: just like you know about two two and a
half years ago i had a bandy graph
[SPEAKER_11]: generator i purchased a full-size bandy
graph generator not a big giant one but it
[SPEAKER_11]: was about three feet tall i turned it on
and poured 100 grams of resin on top of it
[SPEAKER_11]: to see what would happen and it charged
and flung itself and stuck to all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: walls in the whole office oh my god oh
fuck a hundred grams oh yeah it was no
[SPEAKER_07]: problem at the time yeah yeah for sure i
get you but still now it's like fuck i
[SPEAKER_07]: wish i had that hundred grams that's all
over the walls of my office right now that
[SPEAKER_07]: was like a friend uh one of my longtime
friends ron hickey he had gotten this like
[SPEAKER_07]: i think it was like a kilo or two of this
like red oil and i can't remember where it
[SPEAKER_07]: was from like india or something made with
hash and so he it was i guess the guy wore
[SPEAKER_07]: it in like a it was squished in hot into a
plastic thing that went around his body or
[SPEAKER_07]: something and so they had it they froze it
and then they opened the thing and they
[SPEAKER_07]: had this oil and they were trying to they
wanted to put it in a bowl but the bowl
[SPEAKER_07]: was too small it was the biggest bowl they
had so they kind of they kind of were
[SPEAKER_07]: bending it just a little bit and as they
were doing that it shattered and he said
[SPEAKER_07]: there was oil everywhere like all over his
kitchen everywhere on everything even the
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath of his table got some on it he
has no idea how but that was uh that made
[SPEAKER_07]: me laugh too like some of these mistakes
we do holy shit you know marcus i wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell you we went into a dispensary
called kaya down in jamaica oh yes i know
[SPEAKER_01]: the people yeah so they actually had a dab
bar in there and they had a little rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: for us and that's what they were doing
they were giving out dabs of well not
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them but selling dabs of rosin five
dabs for ten dollars or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's hilarious yeah it's just rosin
i mean that's the only concentrates we saw
[SPEAKER_07]: down there that's that's the bob marley uh
that's the bob marley uh brand isn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: the kaya uh yeah when we went in there it
was a it was such a cool place it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary coffee shop and gift shop you
know i'm gonna go play for that tourist
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar and um yeah there was like jerk
chicken hot sauce there that was bob
[SPEAKER_01]: marley branded a lot of bob marley branded
stuff yeah yeah that's the bob marley
[SPEAKER_07]: brand kaya so those are the those are the
people that run that that's awesome yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: so it was a it was yeah definitely a good
trip and you know we went and visited the
[SPEAKER_01]: university the west indies and saw that
grow i saw you went to yui yeah that grow
[SPEAKER_01]: is beautiful um you know lots of lots what
a what an amazing spot to have a grow hey
[SPEAKER_07]: unbelievable yeah i mean it's right on the
fucking campus on the second floor on that
[SPEAKER_01]: tower thing yeah totally i mean i think
that you know i've been trying to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: gig down there to basically uh put in an
extraction lab but we're sort of still in
[SPEAKER_01]: the works of that but i'll keep you posted
on what's going on there beautiful well
[SPEAKER_07]: we're still uh we want to talk to you up
here in canada eventually here as well hey
[SPEAKER_01]: bring me up i'm ready willing and able
well we'll start with a conversation for
[SPEAKER_07]: sure but we definitely want to uh you know
you know mike's uh working with me on the
[SPEAKER_07]: embark project right right right right we
both have a talk of definitely getting dr
[SPEAKER_04]: mark up here for a conversation yeah i got
a room set aside yeah we got to
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenate right hey uh so few fume hood
glove box refluxing roto any anything else
[SPEAKER_01]: i guess we can talk otherwise yeah let's
let's let's talk offline but yeah i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: all those things yeah totally but uh yeah
i'd love to come up and see it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing uh netasha invited me to
uh i guess the cannabis canadian um
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals society is i guess having now a
uh a session on cannabis i don't i think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is in toronto or are you sure in
quebec city i believe okay i think it's um
[SPEAKER_01]: in june sometime but again the fact that
they're actually having a uh a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about it is uh is is is
really cool yeah might be worth us heading
[SPEAKER_01]: down there too mike yeah i mean we need to
have more opportunity for chemists in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and uh you know the fact that the
american chemical society and now the
[SPEAKER_01]: canadian chemical society are paying
attention to this i think is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial because these chemical
societies are the ones that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: author well not author but they're the
ones that basically publish research
[SPEAKER_01]: journals and those are the kind of
research journals that are going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility to some of the r&d that's
going on in the industry so yeah talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about now sam the now sam group or there
so i was asked to speak at a group of what
[SPEAKER_04]: was it national association of scientific
materials and it's all the material man
[SPEAKER_04]: lab chem departments and bio departments
at different universities because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of interest at those universities to
start doing research but you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the researchers aren't able to do the the
research on campus because of the um
[SPEAKER_04]: federal ind issues so i've i've worked
with a couple of companies that have
[SPEAKER_04]: applied to supply nida but until the dea
starts actually issuing license da nida
[SPEAKER_04]: started issuing licenses the supply is
kind of limited so a lot of the university
[SPEAKER_04]: researchers are actually doing research
with independent labs um but there's i
[SPEAKER_04]: mean as as federal law changes and as well
as places abroad allowed that shit we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be able to uh do research at uni
levels be able to create formulated
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid stuff um for uh double blind
placebo trials right now we unfortunately
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do that abroad but as laws change
we will uh be doing that research across
[SPEAKER_01]: the us as well well fortunately i mean we
know how biologically significant these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules are so the cards are stacked in
our favor because you know all these
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases that are mediated by the
endocannetic cannabinoid system i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds are all really important
you know in treating those diseases and so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i mean question is is you know where
where do you start right you know and when
[SPEAKER_01]: the national institute of health comes out
and says that all human disease is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically somehow underpin or connected to
the endocannabinoid system you figure that
[SPEAKER_01]: would give the pharmaceutical companies a
big woody instead you know they're
[SPEAKER_01]: basically again trying to do the end
around on the plant and trying to guess
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what are the best molecules that
they can patent to uh basically elicit the
[SPEAKER_01]: same you know effects that we see with the
plant derived molecules so you know i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis we've said it before is a
medicated plant it's not a drug and so it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be regulated as such and you know
all this ideas about you know what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on with the with the epidiox and the cvd
industry i think a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: really fed up with the uh the double
standard that exists in the u.s regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're putting pressure on their
congress members today i just read a
[SPEAKER_01]: letter the other day that basically is
being sent to the fda by several key
[SPEAKER_01]: members of congress telling them to get
their fucking shit together and stop being
[SPEAKER_01]: so vague and so ambiguous when it comes to
the regulation of what's being allowed and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's not being allowed because it
creates a lot of uncertainty and risk for
[SPEAKER_01]: those who are trying to get into the
industry everybody from a mom and pop
[SPEAKER_01]: little artisan cvd product uh to you know
your multinationals who are trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know really big billion dollar plays
in the industry i think there's room for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody but the uh the government needs
to get the fuck out of the way because
[SPEAKER_01]: right now they're just causing a lot of
uncertainty and a lot of uh speculation
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm on on how they're going to come down
on this well and here's what i think is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to happen you have multiple
candidates that are sponsors of different
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis bills that are going to be
running for election so it no matter what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens you know over the next year and a
half it's going to be a active cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: federal reform is going to be a active
thing whether or not it happens before the
[SPEAKER_04]: election or after the election you just
the way that cannabis laws are going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: in five years are going to be completely
different than the way they were five
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago oh yeah so it's flaws right with
a lot of states a lot of the new states
[SPEAKER_04]: that i've seen they're cut cutting and
pasting similar regulations what they see
[SPEAKER_04]: as the best regulations on the west coast
the eastos will cut and paste a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: out of each state transpose it into their
codexes their legislation and then end up
[SPEAKER_04]: passing similar bills
[SPEAKER_02]: so you end up having a faster evolution
within the
[SPEAKER_04]: state that's going to take years to start
pass it's like any let that federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation it's going to take years it's
you know two steps forward and then you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: realize that one of those steps forward
you have to take a step back and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another two steps forward gotcha if
rescheduling happens uh which has already
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with cbd at the federal level in
the united states if rescheduling happens
[SPEAKER_00]: then uh it will be a drug uh whichever
compounds it is they're claiming as a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh that's really not a great direction
for things to go in my opinion no because
[SPEAKER_00]: then they control it as a pharmaceutical
ingredient exactly marcus exactly and so
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm really i'm a big fan of as many people
as possible being able to grow their own
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the beauties of hash church
have grown their own they can learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make their own medicine um it's uh it's an
ongoing thing and i uh in terms of helping
[SPEAKER_00]: to generate the whole population all the
poke on the planet as well as the animals
[SPEAKER_00]: that share it with us that also have
endocannabinoid systems i love the
[SPEAKER_00]: normalizing the plant but if you look at
legalization quote unquote as it has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened here in california what it is
really is really rigid commercialization
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not legalization it's legal there is
legalization in that yeah you can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce and uh and as an adult uh the police
can't mess with you for having an ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: dried flowers so there's certainly not a
concentrate but in terms of uh again folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who actually need cannabis i know i sound
like a one-trick pony here but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling need that's the thing it's a
compelling need and uh when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization so to speak how it might play
out in the united states my fear is that
[SPEAKER_00]: yes if it goes in the direction of
rescheduling uh where would thc land on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and how are you going to go to a drug
store because that's where drugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: available uh we're going to blow out the
dispensary model and turn that into uh uh
[SPEAKER_00]: walgreens and cbs and these other chain
stores and that level of commercialization
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming to the cannabis marketplace no
question about it uh but i think for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years it's going to be very
complicated and difficult because of
[SPEAKER_00]: states rights issues and local
jurisdictions and national policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see i mean it's come a long way in
my life i mean most of my adult life in
[SPEAKER_00]: the united states you could go to jail for
having a joint and now it's look at where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are now so i give thanks every day in
that way we've come so far but uh right
[SPEAKER_00]: here in california which is you know we've
had legal quote and quote cannabis for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years or more um some of the folks who
most need cannabis their supply chain has
[SPEAKER_00]: been disrupted because of the law the
legalization structure uh just uh outlawed
[SPEAKER_00]: uh compassionate use cooperative
collective model and so that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that legalization can play out um
it's it's not great here we are that's
[SPEAKER_00]: enough hi mark thanks for sharing wade
thank you marcus i really appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash church thing um you yeah whatever i
can do to have this happen more regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: i'd be glad to be involved thank you so

[SPEAKER_07]: do one every week by just sending a blast
email and getting at least 10 people i
[SPEAKER_07]: would prefer it but the show's caliber
