[SPEAKER_21]: So we are recording on the computer now
and we will go live on YouTube as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys hear me by chance?
[SPEAKER_21]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone sounds good.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, what's up, Cliff?
[SPEAKER_21]: Pure pressure in the room.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dan and Bobby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Going on, Cliff.
[SPEAKER_21]: Covert.
[SPEAKER_11]: What up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just going live.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's hope that it allows us to... Oh God,
don't do this.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: The live stream is not moving.
[SPEAKER_21]: The last time it did this to me,
I was unable to go live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I don't know if it's because I have a
shit ton of people in the room before I'm
[SPEAKER_21]: going live.
[SPEAKER_21]: Worst case scenario, this will be a
recorded show that we upload later.
[SPEAKER_21]: What do we know here?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's moving.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's moving.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's moving.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Steve Sy's love.
[SPEAKER_28]: It says live on our side.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's just... Now it's going.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's going.
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome, everybody, to Hash Church 3.0.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the All Rosin episode and we've
got a great show for you in store today.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't exactly know exactly what we have
in store because we haven't had the
[SPEAKER_21]: discussion, but we have some incredible
people in the room that I just want to
[SPEAKER_21]: thank, first of all, for sharing your time
with us and coming in and doing this with
[SPEAKER_21]: us because it's needed.
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of people need this information.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've come a long way since five years
ago, since we started making rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: I did invite a bunch of people from
Instagram, so a lot of the people you see
[SPEAKER_21]: in here were invited based on people.
[SPEAKER_21]: I made a post a couple... It's been months
ago now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I made a post and I asked, who are your
favorite rosin makers?
[SPEAKER_21]: Who are your favorite bubble hash makers?
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of the people in this group right
now are in the favorite rosin makers.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys have been making waves.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys have been posting incredible
inspirational photos, the stuff that gets
[SPEAKER_21]: people's attentions.
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually that's the people who are the most
conscious in regards to the growing of it
[SPEAKER_21]: and creating the resin.
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually it's the trichome farmers.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're growing cannabis for vegetative
weights and how much can I get and how
[SPEAKER_21]: fast can I get it, you're probably not in
this room right now and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not talking down on that at all,
but this is a different game over here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're chasing the highest quality,
the six star bubbles and the rosins that
[SPEAKER_21]: are made from such products.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank all of you for coming in.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think what we're going to do for
starters is we're going to go through a
[SPEAKER_21]: short little introduction on who everyone
is.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been invited in three companies as
well.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Access Rosin, who is here,
Spencer.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've invited Pure Pressure, who is there,
Cliff.
[SPEAKER_21]: I also invited Sasquatch and I'm not sure
they're not in yet, but I wanted everyone
[SPEAKER_21]: to know those were the three companies I
chose to represent.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think companies always do best when they
represent humbly and I know these three
[SPEAKER_21]: companies will.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not here to shove their products
down your throat, but they're here to talk
[SPEAKER_21]: about their products and they're here to
talk about the innovations and whatnot
[SPEAKER_21]: that they've brought to this industry so
far.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll end it with the companies.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll start with Pedro.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to start with Pedro giving us a
quick little low down on who you are and
[SPEAKER_21]: how you got to Rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll move through the group and then
we'll open it up into dialogue.
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead, Pedro.
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy Easter to those who celebrate and
recognize.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't, happy Sunday to you.
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Pedro.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been around the scene for,
I don't know, four or five years now.
[SPEAKER_22]: Started just growing in the LED scene.
[SPEAKER_22]: I really didn't start in the Rosin and
concentrate scene.
[SPEAKER_22]: My wife has fibromyalgia, which is
basically just chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_22]: If I literally poke her, sometimes she'll
just start crying because it's so extreme
[SPEAKER_22]: pain.
[SPEAKER_22]: So flour just wasn't cutting it.
[SPEAKER_22]: We were going through just a lot of flour
and then the lung issues that follow with
[SPEAKER_22]: that kind of made us move over into
looking into concentrates and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, BHO was big then, so we tried
some BHO and it just wasn't my deal.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just didn't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I found myself going back to flour.
[SPEAKER_22]: Got myself a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_22]: Got myself a 600 pound clamp from Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_22]: Pressed some flour the first time and when
I got it, when I got the flour,
[SPEAKER_22]: Rosin, it was immediately, I want better
and I want more.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it just kind of snowballed from there
trying to get better flour.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I'm generally single source.
[SPEAKER_22]: I do wash for some friends here and there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it became a total trek to grow the best
flour.
[SPEAKER_22]: And not just flour, but I consider myself
a resin grower.
[SPEAKER_22]: I harvest and I grow resin glands anymore.
[SPEAKER_22]: And when you switch your mindset to that
as a hash maker, things become a little
[SPEAKER_22]: easier because you're focused on,
for the most part, that glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_22]: head.
[SPEAKER_22]: And everything follows suit from there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was a game to try to find the best
flour, the best trichome head,
[SPEAKER_22]: the juiciest trichome head.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because let's be honest, not all are made
the same.
[SPEAKER_22]: And from there I just started,
the freeze dryer honestly changed the game
[SPEAKER_22]: with me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_22]: When I purchased the freeze dryer and
started pressing the gold that I've been
[SPEAKER_22]: pressing for the last couple years.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it really, really kind of woke
everybody up to the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I started doing some online
courses for teaching hash and rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And let me preface by saying, I don't
consider myself a hash maker per se.
[SPEAKER_22]: I wash hash to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: There are hash makers that wash hash for
full melt hash and my hat's off to you
[SPEAKER_22]: guys.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of you in the house may be both.
[SPEAKER_22]: You may be six star hash makers and rosin
makers.
[SPEAKER_22]: And if I had two hats, I'd take them both
off.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that's just more in the game.
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_22]: Myself, I smoke pretty much
recreationally, although over the years
[SPEAKER_22]: I've gained some more pain and my anxiety
and depression levels and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've all kind of went through
some things like that.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I use it as a medication, but it's not
necessarily for a singular ailment for me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a better life choice for me.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that to me is a medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm Pedro.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, welcome.
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, thanks for sharing, Pedro.
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've heard some of that story before,
but I love it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love people that come at this.
[SPEAKER_21]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I came from it from another
perspective years ago where it was like,
[SPEAKER_21]: I just loved it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it was sort of like, I think I
can use this to escape the slave wage that
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm currently caught in and create a
reality that would maybe allow me to also
[SPEAKER_21]: be with this plant all the time,
but also sort of escape that.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I came into it also with a sort of
monetary touch in the background,
[SPEAKER_21]: but I always appreciate people who come in
it from the health, from the trying to
[SPEAKER_21]: take care of the family members and trying
to take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I love that you're doing education.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you have a great voice for it.
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got that soft, calming,
like I could listen to you on a podcast
[SPEAKER_21]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm going to have to pursue this
podcast thing because you're about the
[SPEAKER_22]: 12th person that said that in the last two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you've got the voice, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you go on the radio, when you listen to
radio voices, like if you don't have the
[SPEAKER_21]: radio voice, like you don't get the radio
job, like that's step one.
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel like I definitely have the face or
the face for radio.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the way to talk yourself out,
Pedro.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to hear from Eric Simpson.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's next in the lineup here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're, uh, yeah, tell us a little bit
about yourself, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: You've, you've, you've caught my
attention.
[SPEAKER_21]: I will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, let me unmute you.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I'm Eric Simpson, Simpson
solving lists.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, you know, I've talked to a lot of you
guys on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to put a face with a name.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, just kinda got onto Instagram
about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before that, I was just always doing my
own thing, you know, um, hands on
[SPEAKER_11]: experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to read about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to get my hands dirty and that's
pretty much how I learned growing since I
[SPEAKER_11]: was 17, you know, uh, the prices of weed
went down so much to where it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_11]: paying my bills anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kind of jumped into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first, you know, I saw, I was into
the butane a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody was into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all hitting it on the hot nails
and I liked the idea, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: of having that extract and all it would
ever do was choke you out at that point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it was, you know, unpurged BHO on a
hot titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, uh, once I actually saw the
hair straightener, I think it was my
[SPEAKER_11]: brother-in-law that showed me that I
thought he was joking at first,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, so just throw a nug in there
with a hair straightener and go at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think the next day I bought a
t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't quite ever do the hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to get that, you know,
t-shirt press right away and go a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I kind of got into it like that and,
and just learned a lot of my tech on a
[SPEAKER_11]: t-shirt press, honestly, and then went
straight to the Longspeak, which is a huge
[SPEAKER_11]: difference and just been pressing and,
you know, refining my skills, but getting
[SPEAKER_11]: on Instagram a year and a half ago was a
big thing too, just to show my work and to
[SPEAKER_11]: learn from a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was inspired, you know, Rackham's was
doing it, a soil grown solvent list.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a few people that caught my eye
and just being able to see their work as
[SPEAKER_11]: well and see all the people, you know,
doing the same thing was great.
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like you've taken it to the next
level though, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think your donuts are amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really inspired by those.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love the way, the different,
the shapes that you're doing, the molds
[SPEAKER_21]: that you're playing with.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that that's also, uh, I think
that's innovative.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think, believe it or not,
it might seem like not much to you,
[SPEAKER_21]: but I think it's, it's really quite
something and it's going to move Ross.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know, when I first saw the laser,
um, that La Colada was doing where they
[SPEAKER_21]: were lasering, like, I thought that was
really cool, but I, I really, really like
[SPEAKER_21]: your, your methodologies of coming out
with a, with the donuts and with these
[SPEAKER_21]: different sort of, you know, texture is
everything at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's everything because we're extracting,
but you took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's so many people out there
making, you know, fire hash, fire rosin
[SPEAKER_11]: that it was nice to set myself apart a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I'm all about quality
first.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to dress up a turd,
you know, it's all about the quality
[SPEAKER_11]: first.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you could take that little,
you know, cooler approach with a
[SPEAKER_11]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's obvious that your stuff is quality,
but it's also obvious that your stuff
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't look like anyone else's stuff
because you've managed to figure out to do
[SPEAKER_21]: something just different enough that to me
really caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just, I give you two thumbs up to
it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope we can talk about it a little bit
more later on when we're done going
[SPEAKER_21]: through the, uh, the introduction of this
panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are Terp savers, not donuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terp savers.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_22]: Real quick, I have to say that I'm just a
little disappointed that I haven't seen a
[SPEAKER_22]: shot on Instagram yet, like an up close
melt shot where somebody drops an entire
[SPEAKER_22]: donut.
[SPEAKER_22]: Where the hell is that shot people?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll go into the core reactor,
I suspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: That person's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's gotta be expensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I wasn't such a perfectionist,
I'd do one right here, but.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, listen, that was great.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let's, uh, let's head over to Roxy
Gray.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're kind of next in my line.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're smiley faces.
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing?
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Give us a, give us a little low down on
how you got into this again and you know,
[SPEAKER_21]: where are you in all of this?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've been, you know, consuming for a
while, but about seven years ago,
[SPEAKER_19]: we got real interested in the organic food
and growing organically and being
[SPEAKER_19]: genetically modified free.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like real concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then transitioned over into our
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we found out it was real hard to
come by or find people that were concerned
[SPEAKER_19]: about those things about seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we kept looking and trying to figure
things out.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we moved to Maine three years ago and
considered had the same problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: Couldn't find organic soil grown
solvent-less material that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we started doing it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, we took up growing and we now run just
a hundred percent soil pots.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all organically cultivated and
amended by hand.
[SPEAKER_19]: We grew our own tea and feed them that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we also do all our own
extractions, washing and pressing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: We use a Long's Peak press.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had a stuff all, you know,
hair straighteners and everything else in
[SPEAKER_19]: between.
[SPEAKER_19]: But for us, when we got into it,
we just wanted to get what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was between a Sasquatch and a Long's
Peak, but the control of the Long's Peak
[SPEAKER_19]: is what won us over.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've loved it ever since we've been
running it for about three years now.
So.
[SPEAKER_21]: And who are some of the names that you
could, that sort of caught your eye that
[SPEAKER_21]: really sort of got you?
[SPEAKER_21]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then soil-grown solvent-less.
[SPEAKER_19]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those guys were like, you know,
definitely killing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think first off and then, you know,
Sasquatch was caring, sharing with a bunch
[SPEAKER_19]: of stuff from all kinds of random dudes
out in Cali.
[SPEAKER_19]: Solvent-less mine was always dropping
great stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, it went from there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I think a bunch of the people in
the room kind of all came about around
[SPEAKER_19]: similar times and kind of found everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think a bunch of us kind of been
following and chatting on, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: different levels for the last few years
now.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, it's really, um,
[SPEAKER_21]: it's Instagram that's really been able to
bring so many people together.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been very unique in that sense that
this picture, you know, this simple app
[SPEAKER_21]: for sharing pictures turned into this
incredible community of people on all
[SPEAKER_21]: sides of cannabis, from the growers to the
organic growers, to the solvent
[SPEAKER_21]: extractors, to the solvent-less
extractors.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been pretty incredible to see it
watch since just 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've only had Instagram for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's really helped share this
information and inspire a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess, uh, we're going to move on to the
second Simpson in the house.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can unmute you too, if you're
having a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: My headphones there again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, um, I was trying to scroll back on my
Instagram to find the first photo that I
[SPEAKER_07]: posted of me making rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to take too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was 2015 and it was flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make oil within 30 seconds with a
nug and, uh, soil-grown solvent-less
[SPEAKER_07]: taught me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw him press a t-shirt press with a
bunch of buds on it between parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Oh my God, what the hell
did just, this just disrupted everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, changed the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I rolled a nug up and I did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: This like the hash rosin would be even
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, you can, you can just roll a
ball of hash in a 25 micron sieve and just
[SPEAKER_07]: go like that and see rosin just a little
bit come out the other side, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like clearly hash rosin is,
is, is better in my opinion, but to each
[SPEAKER_07]: his own.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, we figured that out way back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like 2014 ish.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were probably all figuring that out at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, yup.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that was very much the year that
it all sort of blew up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, so I just, I'm for, so everybody
knows I'm, my name's Adam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Humboldt County who's been here
about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I, I just, I don't have a big
story or anything, but I used to work wash
[SPEAKER_07]: a bunch of trim back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: About 2012, 2013.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I met Bio Vortex, uh,
was lucky enough to work with his material
[SPEAKER_07]: and in her, in her nature on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, just kind of rocked my world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just totally flipped it upside down and
showed me that you can, um, grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: without spraying pesticides and fungicides
and, uh, pay attention to a healthy soil
[SPEAKER_07]: food web.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, if you have the space and time,
you know, it's really efficient and,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, so yeah, I like to make hash and rosin
with, um, really clean cannabis.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we appreciate having you here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a whole variety of people here
today and, you know, some people are like,
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, uh, you know, how do you get on?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, well, it's some people have
been making it for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: Some people are fairly new at it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love inviting a variety of both.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love having people that are the
so-called experts and have been doing this
[SPEAKER_21]: since day one and whatnot, but I also love
people who are, who are freshly into it
[SPEAKER_21]: and who are fairly new into it,
but are the innovation possibility for
[SPEAKER_21]: someone who's new versus someone who's
been doing it forever to me is much
[SPEAKER_21]: higher.
[SPEAKER_21]: The possibility of someone who's coming in
new, who's coming in fresh.
[SPEAKER_21]: They've got a different way of looking at
it than guys that like us who have been
[SPEAKER_21]: doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes we get a little bit of the
blinders on when we've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_21]: a real long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why you always have fun.
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to put a hand out to the next
generation coming up the same way that the
[SPEAKER_21]: giants of the shoulders, myself and others
were able to stand on.
[SPEAKER_21]: They reached down their hand to us.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got to keep doing that for everyone as
well.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, I, I implore people to not be
afraid to make mistakes when you're doing
[SPEAKER_21]: this, because that's where the innovation
comes from.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not going to come from doing the same
old thing that you do all the time.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a recipe that's dialed in over the
course of 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's when you make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's when you step out of your comfort
zone that you're going to, that some of
[SPEAKER_21]: these innovations are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you listen to soil grown himself,
uh, which maybe, maybe now is a good time
[SPEAKER_21]: for me to put that video on.
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can, if I can find it.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you say something about, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it's going to revert back to them.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going to revert back?
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if he's talking to me or I'll
just, for now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think he's talking to someone
else.
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um, yeah, let's keep going with the
introductions.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know a lot of more people are going to
talk about soil grown and I have a really
[SPEAKER_21]: great clip of soil grown, but I want to
listen to it once we've, once we're done
[SPEAKER_21]: and said here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So my good, good buddy is up next flat
four two one buddy.
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_21]: You're here on the Rosin episode.
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_29]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_29]: Nice to be in the house with everybody.
[SPEAKER_29]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_29]: Happy Passover to all the tribesmen and
sisters in the house.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us about who flat four two one is and
how he got turned on to all this goodness.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us your job.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, it helps.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm being friends with bubble man for
sure.
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I've been making hash for about 20
years.
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I've been making rosin since it
started to come on the game.
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I grow my own cannabis where everybody
sort of started seeing me on the Instagram
[SPEAKER_29]: world was in the borrow scene.
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been collecting borrow for 20 years
as well.
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_29]: Not much to say.
[SPEAKER_29]: I, uh, you know, me and my wife,
we cultivate our own cannabis and we wash
[SPEAKER_29]: our own hash and we press it and we share
it with our friends.
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't have a very good picture.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like your journey.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you have a very good picture going as
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the journey.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I like how, you know, you started,
you know, originally you were,
[SPEAKER_21]: you were kind of making some BHO too.
[SPEAKER_21]: You were busting out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_29]: I made a lot of BHO in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_29]: My genius sits collecting dust.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I, what I've noticed from,
from Flav is that when he was making BHO,
[SPEAKER_21]: his herb wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_21]: When he ditched making BHO and started
going down the full, like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_21]: try and make like, like full melt hash and
like great rosin, his herb just started
[SPEAKER_21]: getting better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I mean, I already showed you guys,
you know, his whip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Six star bubble hash right here that
basically looks like rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's some of the most beautiful bubble
hash I've ever, I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_21]: So props to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're one of the people that has been
willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, sometimes people get into this,
especially you.
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought, you know, even though you're a
super humble guy, you've already had a
[SPEAKER_21]: position in the community with your Boro
collection that was way, way up.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I saw you willing to go back down and
take each step that you needed to take in
[SPEAKER_21]: your growing, in your learning.
[SPEAKER_21]: And even now, I mean, with the organic
crop on the, on the, on the way,
[SPEAKER_21]: like that's another step that you're
taking looking to get past salt newts,
[SPEAKER_21]: looking to get into organic and
regenerative and living.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've just, dude, I've been really
impressed with your, with your patience in
[SPEAKER_21]: the journey, even though you know,
so many people that are at so many
[SPEAKER_21]: different levels, you just took your
steps.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you never tried to jump above
and beyond what you were able to do.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you just took your steps and dude,
you like made it to the six star level is
[SPEAKER_21]: all.
[SPEAKER_29]: Those are very kind words.
[SPEAKER_29]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it's a fact, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's easier to say them now that you've
come out the other end.
[SPEAKER_21]: It would have been harsh to throw you
under the bus and been like, Flav just
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't grow that good a weed.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know, like if I said that three or
four years ago, but the bottom line is
[SPEAKER_21]: you're growing greater, you're making
great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm happy to have you here,
brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of reminds me of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Pedro said how he's grown,
grown mostly for rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to respectfully disagree with
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's growing for resin because
that rosin is going to be even better if
[SPEAKER_07]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I think that Pedro, every time he
does it and he smokes his rosin,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's actually stepping up his,
his resin game really, because your rosin
[SPEAKER_07]: is only better if your resins is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's only as good as the resin.
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, I misspoke there,
but I definitely meant that I was growing
[SPEAKER_22]: resin for sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree 100% with you.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to hear from a long time hash
Churcher.
[SPEAKER_21]: Colin from Vessel Life Science is going to
give us a quick little low down on him.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to whip through the
last eight to nine people and get a full
[SPEAKER_21]: dialogue because I want to hear from all
of you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for having me brother.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone can hear me.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_16]: So my story is, you know, I it's a long
one, but I'll try to keep it cliff note.
[SPEAKER_16]: I started making hash in 99.
[SPEAKER_16]: I met Marcus on, on Overgrow and we,
you know, I started posting pictures and
[SPEAKER_16]: of hash and really going after making
refined hash with the bag system.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that led me to, you know, two decades
of going really deep on genetic collection
[SPEAKER_16]: and acquisition.
[SPEAKER_16]: And growing thousands and thousands of
varieties to try to find the perfect
[SPEAKER_16]: return and the perfect heads to be,
be working with.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I, I, you know,
been making rosin that led to rosin and,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, that led to, to where I'm at
now, working in Massachusetts with happy
[SPEAKER_16]: Valley and running the solventless lab for
them and designing the lab out and really
[SPEAKER_16]: building the team for us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, just trying to keep it as
humble and as, as precise as possible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Why we, you know, build out everything
that we're doing here in mass.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, the one thing that I've
really been inspired by over the years is,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the different varieties and the
different flavors that we can get from
[SPEAKER_16]: hash and understanding what carriers,
you know, in flavonoids pass through the
[SPEAKER_16]: water and into your hash and just
selecting through varieties that really
[SPEAKER_16]: work.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's been a, been a passion of mine.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it's, it's been,
it's been a long journey.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's, it really has,
but I'm very thankful to, to be where I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: at right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's, it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: So.
[SPEAKER_21]: I would only add that the photo that you
all shared on Instagram for this episode
[SPEAKER_21]: was seeds collected, bred, grown,
processed, and photographed by Colin.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a man of many hats.
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful picture of rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll move on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Great Lake Sustainable.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, you're next.
[SPEAKER_21]: Andy's in the house.
[SPEAKER_27]: I can unmute you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, I'm Andy.
[SPEAKER_27]: Great Lakes Greece on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I started making rosin when Soil Grown
first posted his tech.
[SPEAKER_27]: We pretty much, FVICRX and I pretty much
started squishing flowers right away with
[SPEAKER_27]: the hair straightener and no clamp.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we figured out the clamp tech
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then not short after we started
squishing some of our hash.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I, I mean, I remember the first time
trying flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_27]: And one thing that I remember for sure is
how different the effects were from full
[SPEAKER_27]: melt.
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, cause I had been making full melt,
really good full melt already for a few
[SPEAKER_27]: years.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I remember trying that first dab of
flower rosin and it was just, it just had
[SPEAKER_27]: a different effect on me.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was, it was, it was just different.
[SPEAKER_27]: It reminded me of almost like the first
time smoking cannabis almost.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do like hash rosin much more than flower
rosin.
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things I really like about
flower rosin is like the, the easiness of
[SPEAKER_27]: it, as people have already mentioned how,
how simple it is to just take a nug and
[SPEAKER_27]: squish it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And a lot of times you can get with really
good flower, you can get really high
[SPEAKER_27]: yields with flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's what I really like about it in,
in for using for capsules.
[SPEAKER_27]: So you can get reliable yields and it's
really good in my opinion for making
[SPEAKER_27]: capsules.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's like my best use for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Hash rosin, I, I mainly focus on,
making full melt.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I, but rosin is definitely like an
important part of the process for me,
[SPEAKER_27]: because before, before hash rosin really,
you know, hash makers, hash makers know,
[SPEAKER_27]: and some, some people don't know that,
you know, some, some of the hash that you
[SPEAKER_27]: pull out of your bags is not going to be
melty.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of the strains you wash is not going
to be melty as others, different factors.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so it, it really plays an important
role when we have less melty hash and
[SPEAKER_27]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we can, for me, at least I can get a
much better use out of that hash when I
[SPEAKER_27]: rosin it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I can have, you know, my,
my full melt and rosins, the rosins hash
[SPEAKER_27]: that may not have been as melty or as
pure.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's really where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_27]: I, I love, I love how revolutionary of a
tech it was.
[SPEAKER_27]: I love how quickly it took off.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, how fun is it to watch this
progress?
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's really what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Simplicity, simplicity, revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it just, it just has a very important
part, plays a very important part in my
[SPEAKER_27]: hash making.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was happy how it sort of, and I don't,
I know I'll take flack from this because
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll probably say it the wrong way,
but how it just really, it took a bite out
[SPEAKER_21]: of the BHO scene.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, and I'm not talking about the pros
who are doing it right, who have degrees
[SPEAKER_21]: in chemistry and understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about high school kids.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about young people who are
blowing up, who are having all sorts of
[SPEAKER_21]: problems, who blew their roofs off and set
their houses on fire.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a, blew their hands off,
like a lot of bad shit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like before BHO accidents, I can honestly
say the worst thing about cannabis was the
[SPEAKER_21]: DEA.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were by far the worst thing about
cannabis, but then BHO came into the
[SPEAKER_21]: picture and I was like, damn, like this
shit is killing people.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know it was like not an over,
you know, like 50 people a day,
[SPEAKER_21]: but it was, it was people were definitely
being affected in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, because I was the water hash guy,
a lot of them would reach out to me after
[SPEAKER_21]: they blew up, after they got burnt.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I ended up making friends with quite a
few people who blew themselves up making
[SPEAKER_21]: BHO because they didn't understand the
heaviness of the gas.
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't understand that there are cell
phones and other electronics spark
[SPEAKER_21]: invisibly that you can't perceive that
spark.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just thought that rosin was the most
incredible replacement.
[SPEAKER_21]: And not only that it was just as cheap,
like, you know, a couple of cans of
[SPEAKER_21]: butane.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well a $10 hair straightener from
Walmart, like one of the many ones,
[SPEAKER_21]: like what naked tea was originally using
that soil grown saw him use was one of
[SPEAKER_21]: those small tiny little, little,
little hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was a pretty incredible thing to be
able to put into the hands of the,
[SPEAKER_21]: of the younger generation to be like,
here's a way for you to test.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, if they say that's 23% THC,
squish a gram, you should get more than
[SPEAKER_21]: 0.23 back with simple math.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a nice power to put into people's
hands, to be able to check the quality,
[SPEAKER_21]: to be able to see if something that wasn't
supposed to be in that plant, like
[SPEAKER_21]: something sprayed maybe, maybe a sulfur
for powdery mildew or something else.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, when you concentrate that into a,
into a dab, you'll know immediately.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was an incredible methodology that
appeared for dispensaries and compassion
[SPEAKER_21]: clubs to be able to test flour that was
coming in right away with someone who had
[SPEAKER_21]: a sensitive bioassay ability and a hair
straightener and a, and a rig right then
[SPEAKER_21]: and there.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I, I liked that point and I want to
talk about it a little more.
[SPEAKER_21]: But now I've got to move on to the next.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_21]: It totally shifted.
[SPEAKER_21]: And now it's all in a different order.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you know what, we'll go to heavy ice
because I know you guys are close and he's
[SPEAKER_21]: got a cat and nobody else does.
[SPEAKER_21]: So he, he wins.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going buddy?
[SPEAKER_21]: Going good.
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as Andy said, and as everybody else
said, 2014 was the year I had,
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a, my first outdoor crop in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I didn't have any hashing
experience then either.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it, it didn't hash as fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a whole freezer full of blue
dream and from my first outdoor crop and
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't do anything with it and saw soil
grown, do the pressing and like went on
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon that night and ordered those like
mesh drying racks and took all the fresh
[SPEAKER_06]: frozen out of the bags that had been in
there for months already, put it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: drying screens and.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let it all dry out and trimmed it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I, we made a couple ounces,
I think of, of blue dream flower rising
[SPEAKER_06]: back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that, that sold it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we had a couple of little chunks
of hash either from the blue dream or from
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the other plants that I grew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was amazing just to wrap up those
little, little tiny balls and some 25
[SPEAKER_06]: micron mesh and get the hair straightener
out and squeeze it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you had, you had like oil,
you had straight up oil that was as good
[SPEAKER_06]: or better than the BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd been spending all my disability money
on it, the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we just went from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my, my focus has still always been to
make good hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as Andy said, you know, if you grow a
whole pack of seeds and you have six
[SPEAKER_06]: different females or eight different
females, and you don't have a phenol hunt
[SPEAKER_06]: time, you're still going to wash all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those, all those plants, but they
might not all be melty and rosin hash
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin just made it so that you could
really make use of, of all that hash
[SPEAKER_06]: still.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it was subpar taste for,
for dabbing, you could, you could put the
[SPEAKER_06]: oil right in some coconut oil for
capsules.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just, everything just kind of
made sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was all part of a process that
already existed in the universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were just, we were just going,
oh yeah, yeah, we should do it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You became aware.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I noticed.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an awareness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the blue dream back then,
somehow I think maybe John Berfalo had
[SPEAKER_06]: been looking at my pictures on Facebook or
Instagram and had the cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_06]: people use one of my photos for one of
their articles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was one of the first bumps in my
Instagram career as well as, as when that
[SPEAKER_06]: got posted, they had my name in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got, you know, a few thousand new
followers and that just made everything
[SPEAKER_06]: more interesting, you know, to keep
posting information and cool pictures
[SPEAKER_06]: because it got more people on board and
you know, it got more people interested in
[SPEAKER_06]: solvent lists and in organic growing and
all the things I was trying to do and
[SPEAKER_06]: focus on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it all just kind of spiraled from
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you become aware, you put a megaphone
on that awareness through your growing,
[SPEAKER_21]: your selections, your processing,
the pictures of the resin that becomes
[SPEAKER_21]: exposed to this group of people.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the Johnny B's, you know,
they pick them out and it ends up it's
[SPEAKER_21]: quite, it's, it's quite a neat thing to
see how the community grows.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_21]: Flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I prefer full micron, full micron
rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what flower rosin is.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, it's all the microns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and it's also maybe some trichome
types that you don't get when you just
[SPEAKER_06]: hash it first.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I can promise you there are,
they're called bulbous trichomes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not separate or isolate easily.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes at all with a mechanical screen
separation.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's why you get a different high-end
flower rosin and it's why you get
[SPEAKER_21]: different yields when you make oil versus
when you make hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you could earmark that topic for
conversation in this show.
[SPEAKER_22]: The difference between separating your
hash in screens and then pressing it or
[SPEAKER_22]: dropping it all into the 45 bag like I do
and pressing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Full micron.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_21]: We went through, Oh Chris, damn it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn it, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's your turn, brother.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_21]: Is anyone else like the guy from like King
of the Hill say that when you read his
[SPEAKER_21]: name?
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is it just me?
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of why I did it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us how things are and what you're up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started in Texas, obviously where the
name came from, Squish and Flower Rosin,
[SPEAKER_14]: because I was sick of smoking all the BHO
that was in the area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super expensive and just horrible.
[SPEAKER_14]: Learned about Squish and Flower Rosin
through soil grown and just like everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: else, wanted more and wanted better.
[SPEAKER_14]: So after getting into out of trouble in
Texas a bunch, moved out to the Portland,
[SPEAKER_14]: Oregon area and started pursuing making
hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: It took a little while, was in and out of
just working at dispensaries, was a
[SPEAKER_14]: purchasing manager for one for a little
while and then landed with a company in
[SPEAKER_14]: Battleground, Washington and started
making, solving this hash with them after
[SPEAKER_14]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was all strictly for Rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: They weren't doing any melt or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was all production for Rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of where it all began.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was working in the legal market and
making Rosin there.
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, we were doing a hoop
house, me and a good buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we took that down and washed it
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: And from then on out, I switched and
started working with Archive in Portland,
[SPEAKER_14]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Burnside Garden Collective is the garden
that I wash for in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, we are right now we're making a
lot of Rosin there as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We make a lot of full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything single source.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You make flour Rosin as well?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I did back in Texas when that was all
I could get.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was by year.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: We smoke pretty much just full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: I smoke some Rosin every now and then.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really nice too.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do prefer smoking resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: But since I've been having to focus on
making Rosin so much over the last three
[SPEAKER_14]: years, that's been, you know, it's kind of
been refined big time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we do the cold care process over
there and that's kind of how we sell all
[SPEAKER_14]: our Rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't release any fresh press either.
[SPEAKER_14]: Although we do have some that we could
release.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just right now we kind of prefer to
do the cold care.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been it's received well, you know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, maybe we can talk about that if it's
not proprietary later.
[SPEAKER_21]: If it is, no worries.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable
with anything, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always nice to share techniques,
you know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_21]: I always think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_21]: The same way it's always nice to share
cuts.
[SPEAKER_21]: And people are like when people say like,
well, you know, you got to like vet them
[SPEAKER_21]: and see if they're, you know, like I'm
like you got to vet someone for a cut.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, they might not be
deserving.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like not be deserving.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like we look at things differently because
I look at it like what if you gave some
[SPEAKER_21]: like, oh, just a piece of shit like a
really nice cut.
[SPEAKER_21]: But somehow someone that piece of shit
knew really needed that cut.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe even a small child with epilepsy or
something.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like get past your own ego of sharing
a cut or some techniques, you know.
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't mean for sure everything.
[SPEAKER_21]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone spent like millions of dollars
and paid Ph.D.s and they bred a cultivar
[SPEAKER_21]: over the course of nine years,
I definitely would not be trying to shame
[SPEAKER_21]: those people into sharing a cut.
[SPEAKER_21]: But, geez, most of these cuts are just
regurgitated and passed along and then
[SPEAKER_21]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_21]: People feel the power is in holding it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I told I told Jason King this years
ago when I asked him if he could turn me
[SPEAKER_21]: on to how to do macro photography.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was like, yeah, I'll show you how
to do macro photography as soon as you
[SPEAKER_21]: show me how to like manufacture and sell
bubble bags worldwide.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like he was upset that I asked him,
like really upset.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was like, all right, dude,
like you're going to be the guy that kept
[SPEAKER_21]: me from learning about macro photography.
[SPEAKER_21]: So then I went online to overgrow and
there was this guy monkey and another guy,
[SPEAKER_21]: perhaps your giddy aunt from back in the
late 90s who were just so kind.
[SPEAKER_21]: They told me what lens to get,
what flash to get, what settings I might
[SPEAKER_21]: want to put it on initially.
[SPEAKER_21]: And just helped me in a way that to this
day I've shared every single thing I know
[SPEAKER_21]: about macro photography, the equipment,
the settings, everything that I could
[SPEAKER_21]: share because I didn't want to be that guy
when this story got told that was on the
[SPEAKER_21]: wrong side of history that went fear and
scarcity and decided, oh, I can't share
[SPEAKER_21]: this.
[SPEAKER_21]: In the end, Jason King is not known for
macro photography.
[SPEAKER_21]: His macro photography petered right out
after basically I asked him he stopped
[SPEAKER_21]: doing it and he could have been the guy
that was getting like, oh, and then Jason
[SPEAKER_21]: King showed me the way.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate all of you for that very
reason.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys share a lot of information and
it's important.
[SPEAKER_21]: People need it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the key to this is all of you are
mentioning soil grown today.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, and I've invited a man and I'm
texting him while we're talking,
[SPEAKER_21]: hoping that he'll come in because I know
it would make him very happy to see what a
[SPEAKER_21]: wildfire he got.
[SPEAKER_21]: He set ablaze and there were people that
he propped before him, but he was really
[SPEAKER_21]: this key point that allowed everyone to
start thinking about something that they
[SPEAKER_21]: otherwise didn't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't in their minds.
[SPEAKER_21]: And now you've got innovators.
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got people doing different things
and it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_21]: So props to all of you.
[SPEAKER_21]: And after Bobby, it's going to be Brian at
Best Friend Farms.
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing brother?
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, doing well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm definitely excited to join in and just
share and learn.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been really great.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Instagram thing, I started actively a
little longer a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I actively got into it less than two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of how I met everyone here
more knowing who some characters were,
[SPEAKER_09]: of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just, I guess with Roz and it was
probably four plus five up to five years
[SPEAKER_09]: ago, four I'd say where we were squishing
with a flower or a flower with the hair
[SPEAKER_09]: iron as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it was just a really quick step
into the Sasquatch actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I worked, my role I guess has been
even the whole time, even now more
[SPEAKER_09]: actively with the cultivation,
but more from the seed breeding angle
[SPEAKER_09]: where I'm picking out those, what we were
talking about for hash plants for bubble
[SPEAKER_09]: making these days and getting a list
running.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just now stepping into the Rosin
here more for fresh frozen from hash
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could talk a lot about a bunch of the
things on the way up here, but we're,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're basically stepping into it now,
locking into certain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really I'm looking almost like
intricately for the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now gas mask is the recent one that I bred
that we're just having amazing results and
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of started working with that trying
to whip the bubble off the gas mask is
[SPEAKER_09]: what started that whipping the bubble for
the bubble cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: And truthfully, I kind of liked the bubble
cream even more than the Rosin for the,
[SPEAKER_09]: even for my own personal needs.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got to find it.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of people in there.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you started whipping the bubble thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: You were one of the first people to do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'm one of the first.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kind of started this resin doesn't
want to behave and like other resin on the
[SPEAKER_09]: gas mask.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I would compare it to what I
used to see for a super snow dog was
[SPEAKER_09]: actually what threw down this fresh,
frozen bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was just white cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you honestly couldn't do much with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, leave it alone, get it as
small as you could, leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the gas mask has been that way too,
where we're taking different angles for
[SPEAKER_09]: receiving the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of leaving it a little bigger
chunk for the two week air dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always doing a two week air dry and
same as this bubble cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I think I might've pulled this
one out at about 10 to 12 days on the dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one again here, this is almost a
month on aging here after it got in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll just show the Rosin or
actually this is the newest batch of
[SPEAKER_09]: bubble cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a little harder consistency,
a guilty kind of custard or fudge on that
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, interesting how each
batch of resin is different and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: tweaking it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a five minute poll right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one I showed before, the older is
about a 20 minute wash, I'd say kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: fuller wash, which brought out some of
these oils even to the later, into a month
[SPEAKER_09]: cure.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all room temp cure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, so we've been kind of gas mask
heavy, pulled some live Rosin from the gas
[SPEAKER_09]: mask.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's about two to three.
[SPEAKER_09]: Weeks on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of reflective.
[SPEAKER_09]: I whipped it about three days ago after
like two weeks room temp.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, that's kind of what we're doing
these days.
[SPEAKER_21]: Some creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to smoke all of them for that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Love to share.
[SPEAKER_21]: Kenney, dude, thanks for coming in.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ken Wall's in the house.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's going to tell us a little bit about
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_26]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_21]: You did old school at this point.
[SPEAKER_26]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_26]: I did a podcast with the Hashishin about a
month or two ago after I did a class and
[SPEAKER_26]: he kind of brought up the same thing.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was like, man, I don't really think
so, but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been a long like seven, eight years
or so.
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, man, it's been a great ride.
[SPEAKER_26]: But as far as how I got into Rosin,
there was accidents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, like we would press out like
you're you brought up Nick.
[SPEAKER_26]: He would use like a hair straightener and
put bubble between two pieces,
[SPEAKER_26]: a piece of parchment or whatever and
flatten it and flag it out.
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we would do that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_26]: But forget the hair straightener was on
too hot or whatever and press it super
[SPEAKER_26]: hard.
[SPEAKER_26]: And it would kind of separate the oils out
a little bit from the hash in the middle
[SPEAKER_26]: and be like, well, that's that's cool.
[SPEAKER_26]: But we kind of fucked up our slab a little
bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_26]: But and then, you know, we saw it a few
weeks, months later.
[SPEAKER_26]: On Hash Church right here, I think me and
Jibs are on.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, me and Jibs are on watching and you
could barely see soil growing.
[SPEAKER_26]: He was like, I think standing on top of
the T-shirt press to get as much pressure
[SPEAKER_26]: as he could to get all that is as much out
as he could.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_26]: We had a light bulb go off right when we
saw that.
[SPEAKER_26]: And as far as Jibs and I, we ran a hash
company in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_26]: Medical and recreational called the Meltz
Trichome Heavy Extracts.
[SPEAKER_26]: And he still operates that in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_26]: But anyways, we had all this 25U and 45U
that was just sitting there, you know,
[SPEAKER_26]: when we we had no idea what to do with it
and it wasn't selling.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're like, oh, my God, let's put this
between a screen and press this.
[SPEAKER_26]: And it was just a eureka moment.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I really think, you know, soil grown.
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish he was on, like you said.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I wanted to always thank him
personally for just like, man,
[SPEAKER_26]: that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_26]: Such a huge, huge thing for not only my
business, but for obviously this scene in
[SPEAKER_26]: this community.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's kind of how I got started.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I deal mostly with hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_26]: I like a lot of people here and got
inspired by Bubble Man and other people to
[SPEAKER_26]: make full melt hash.
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's kind of what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_26]: And anything that's not full melt or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: And even if it is full melt, I'll press it
and to see what I can really what gold I
[SPEAKER_26]: can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_26]: The consumers and patients here I feel in
Colorado are very picky and specific.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we try and put out every type of
consistency.
[SPEAKER_26]: I own and run a company called Single
Source Colorado with two partners,
[SPEAKER_26]: Tony and Logan.
[SPEAKER_26]: And we put out cold cure, you know,
the sugar tech, the diamond tech with the
[SPEAKER_26]: oven and fresh press as well and full melt
of different microns.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we try and be is giving to all types,
you know, of consumers and patients.
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, that's kind of my story.
[SPEAKER_26]: And just thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_26]: Can't wait to get into some hash talk.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ken.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to have you here for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice to hear some of that history.
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, I'm going to share a video of
soil grown if he doesn't end up coming on.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, he's got a lot of kids,
too.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a tough time in the morning on
Easter, especially so agreed.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll forgive him.
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So next up on the list is Bo Costello.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to unmute you.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can actually I can unmute you.
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to unmute you.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we introduce yourself, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be able to talk a little bit about hash
and rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been a part of my life for about
12 years now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just been trying to seek out some of
the best flavors that I could get my hands
[SPEAKER_10]: on to.
[SPEAKER_10]: So breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Selecting cultivars has been a huge part
of my life, basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: But just it started out, you know,
big production.
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of had to find a I got a little
nervous, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of crazy to be able to talk
to you, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking to five or six hundred
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is this is truly special.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, rosin kind of came to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a friend come over to the farm and I
knew instantly that it was going to be be
[SPEAKER_10]: taken over the BHO, honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was able to, you know, get back and
do I'm too nervous.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even talk right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't be nervous about anything.
[SPEAKER_21]: Take a rip, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll all have a rip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_26]: We love I love you.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just keep talking.
[SPEAKER_26]: I just appreciate that, brother.
[SPEAKER_26]: Dude, I was just gagging before I talked
to you.
[SPEAKER_26]: So don't worry about it, bro.
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't seen you in a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I skipped over like a ton of shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: So keep going, brother.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate all you guys doing.
[SPEAKER_29]: Mark that's not nervous because he does
this all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's no doubt, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just been growing pot for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: First dab I took wasn't until,
you know, 10 years ago, and I just fell in
[SPEAKER_10]: love with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So man, this is too much, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: I always get to the scene from Half Baked
when I hear someone say I just fell in
[SPEAKER_21]: love with it when they were like 14 and
they smoked their first joint.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then he goes into the into the into
the store and he's like, Abba Zabba,
[SPEAKER_21]: you my only friend.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's like you were just talking about
dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought seeds basically four days after
my first hit a weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started, you know, watching any YouTube
videos I could find.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yours were some of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brown Dirt Warrior.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brown Dirt Warrior.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: No joke, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: He got me out there in the woods doing
some crazy shit for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't see that guy for 15 years and I
just bumped into him probably six months
[SPEAKER_21]: ago for the first time.
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw him face to face.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we got to share a dab and hang out for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is a really, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_21]: So cool that you would mention him.
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, just growing has been my passion.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I've been trying to just I've
been seeking out that true turf from
[SPEAKER_10]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all smell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all wanted it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And back to my friend giving me that rosin
dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew right then that was the way it was
the first time I've ever actually tasted
[SPEAKER_10]: what I seeked out during the harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you growing organically?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're all organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually just got our farm started.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be single source here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Organic has been the only way I've grown
for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started with some advanced nutrients
like most of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I let the marketing kind of get
me the stores.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's quite a jump from advanced nutrients
to full organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was lucky to meet a guy, James Bowman,
here in the Applegate Valley that just
[SPEAKER_10]: knew exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was growing from the land, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He had goats, llamas, chickens.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he was able to teach us how to grow
consciously, basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: So ever since then, that's all I've been
able to really grow towards is being
[SPEAKER_10]: better at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, the resin is just better that
way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're all starting to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sungrown is something I believe in.
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I look forward to seeing what you
produce.
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like at least more than a few
people on the panel know your stuff.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll be stoked once we get the dialogue
going.
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a lot of us, so we'll be using
the chat once we get the dialogue going.
[SPEAKER_21]: If people have something they want to
input in, I can moderate pretty easily and
[SPEAKER_21]: break into the conversation for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to finish up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got one, two.
[SPEAKER_22]: Real quick, for my own curiosity,
is that Bow's nose nose?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_22]: Good to see your face, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you too, damn it, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're killing it, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: You too, boo.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's hear from Goldilocks.
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldilocks, you're next in the tune.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can unmute you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe I can't.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's weird how I can unmute some folks,
but others I can't.
[SPEAKER_25]: I had myself muted.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah, kind of same story as everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_25]: Just gotten into the rosin, really,
because we liked smoking hash at the time.
[SPEAKER_25]: And started pressing hash into rosin.
[SPEAKER_25]: Started doing a little flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_25]: Moved up to pressing and doing all that.
[SPEAKER_25]: But for the beginning, it was always just
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I think that the rosin is so
much different than all the other areas.
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't really find many hash makers
that aren't smoking their product and know
[SPEAKER_25]: exactly what they're putting out.
[SPEAKER_25]: In areas of cannabis, you'll see people
don't really even smoke their own product.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's suspect at best.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think that's what's cool about
rosin, though.
[SPEAKER_25]: You won't find that in the hash game.
[SPEAKER_25]: And another thing I love about the hash
and the rosin, like you were saying
[SPEAKER_25]: earlier, is there's no lying about your
flower at that point.
[SPEAKER_25]: Once you wash your hash and put it into
rosin, if you're spraying things,
[SPEAKER_25]: if you're doing gnarly stuff to your
plants, that's coming out, for sure,
[SPEAKER_25]: in the rosin.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just like that purity of getting it
down to its basis.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I dab heavy.
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody that I'm around all the time,
we dab.
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's always constantly about getting
the terpiest rosin that we want to
[SPEAKER_25]: physically smoke, and then trying to put
that out on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you guys aren't pressing grams over
there.
[SPEAKER_25]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_25]: But we definitely started doing that,
just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, absolutely, for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, thanks for sharing, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that you'll be good at some of the
dialogue and discussion we get going on.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's already 10 o'clock, which is an
hour, and we haven't finished the
[SPEAKER_21]: introductions, and that's okay,
because it's an awesome panel.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm stoked to see the cannabis
reverend just came in.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: One of my OG, like when the rosin thing
was blowing up, that dude was right beside
[SPEAKER_21]: me.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll tell some funny stories.
[SPEAKER_22]: Was blessed to meet him at Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_22]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_22]: Cheers, reverend.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, cheers.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I need to go to, I don't see your name,
brother.
[SPEAKER_21]: It just says Galaxy S10E.
[SPEAKER_21]: But you got the cool photo of Ganesha
behind you, so you can introduce yourself
[SPEAKER_21]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Dog Man Troupe.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dog Man Troupe on Instagram, obviously.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to every single one of you,
especially you, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're where I basically learned all the
tech on how to fucking wash and all that
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to, what up Andy, Great Lakes
Grease.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically the first dude I chilled
with and gave me a dab of some crazy full
[SPEAKER_08]: melt hash, bro, and just blew my mind
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the time I was dabbing BHO,
and we're from the same area, so we met up
[SPEAKER_08]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me, actually we did like fucking
10 dabs, and just, I've never been so high
[SPEAKER_08]: in my life, like that awkward high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And me and Andy just hit it off,
had a great time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And from there on out, I sought out to
start making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rosin came out with
soil-grown solvless, just like every one
[SPEAKER_08]: of us, and just started from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the jam tech came out with,
what was his name who put out the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: tech on the jam, but he's not really out
there anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Diet Funk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Diet Funk, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Diet Funk put out that whole story on the
jam tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: I became obsessed with that until I got
that right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I found the consumers weren't really,
once the cold cure came out, the consumers
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted the cold cure over the jam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I started doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically what I do now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I make a lot of diamonds with the
turps, separating the turps and THCA,
[SPEAKER_08]: mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_08]: People seem to like that over here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just shout out to each and every one of
you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It definitely made me think an interesting
thought about how a lot of the innovation
[SPEAKER_21]: is being driven by the customer,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's creating innovation, so it's very
cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't sell anything myself, so I never
thought of it like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: But in listening to you speak,
I saw that loud and clear, and that's
[SPEAKER_21]: cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_21]: Next up on the list to introduce,
we'll go with Rackhums.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_21]: What up?
[SPEAKER_17]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully good and safe.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.
[SPEAKER_17]: What up, Rackhums?
[SPEAKER_17]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Name's Nick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Rackhums on social media and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been doing hash and rosin for the
last three years now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of came up out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't growing.
[SPEAKER_17]: My wife's been growing for about 10 plus
years now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, just my buddy introduced me to hash
and the flat iron.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had been doing automotive stuff for
almost 20 years at that point.
[SPEAKER_17]: I already had a H-frame press at work.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a huge 50-ton, but my boss wouldn't
let me bring it to work or bring it home.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I bought my own and had a buddy of mine
that's a fabricator, shout out Joe Rhodes,
[SPEAKER_17]: and made my very first set of plates.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then from there, I got the low temp
press and just been trying to make and
[SPEAKER_17]: unveil the best hashes I could bring to
the table.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate everybody on this channel
right now, along with Soil Grown,
[SPEAKER_17]: Nickatee, everybody from the Northern
California area.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've showed a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_17]: And across the world, it's a privilege to
be here.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think one of the reasons you blew
up so much was that you were always
[SPEAKER_21]: willing to share information.
[SPEAKER_21]: And particularly, although you weren't the
first, you were definitely one that got a
[SPEAKER_21]: lot of attention when you started doing
your mechanical screen separation of THCA
[SPEAKER_21]: there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was definitely something that caught
a lot of people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk about that more once we get in
discussion.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're almost there, actually.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got Mark from Covert Extracts.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_21]: Camera's off.
[SPEAKER_21]: Should I not have called on you?
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cannabis Reverend, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see who's going to unmute first.
[SPEAKER_23]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_23]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_23]: Nice to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been a long time, that's for sure,
man.
[SPEAKER_23]: Been a long time.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's good to see you guys all here for the
love of rosin today.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, man, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's good to see you here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, when all this was happening,
was it 2014 that we were in Spain and
[SPEAKER_21]: Barcelona at my booth?
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it was 2015, man.
[SPEAKER_23]: Sol Grown in February came out with the
tech or really put it out there on
[SPEAKER_23]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I went down and saw Space down in
Oakland and we figured out the mesh bag
[SPEAKER_23]: method with the 25 micron pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_23]: And a couple of weeks later, we were in
Spain pressing out that beautiful barb at
[SPEAKER_23]: your booth.
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you remember who was standing at the
booth at that time?
[SPEAKER_23]: Man, there were several folks.
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that Flav was there and Greg
Gardner.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm trying to remember who all was there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Remo was there, Don and Aaron from DNA.
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a ton of people from the
industry standing in front of the booth
[SPEAKER_21]: watching that go down.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm pretty sure it's on video.
[SPEAKER_23]: Hell yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: It was epic times, man.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was watching everybody that went out to
Spain this year being like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_23]: I really wish I could have made it.
[SPEAKER_23]: Got to get out to one of those Masters of
Rosin tournaments one of these years.
[SPEAKER_21]: I judged it last year.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_21]: I landed and I bumped into it.
[SPEAKER_21]: David at HQ and he was like, here's like
there was 60 different Rosins that he
[SPEAKER_21]: handled in a box that I have right over
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_21]: You definitely would enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_21]: But not this year.
[SPEAKER_21]: This year wasn't the year to go.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'll never forget pressing up all
that Rosin there in the HQ.
[SPEAKER_23]: Bring in Rosin out there to Spain.
[SPEAKER_23]: It was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_23]: Good times for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_21]: My first Rosin videos is exactly the 25
micron screen from the bubble bags with a
[SPEAKER_21]: tiny little ball of hash wrapped in it and
just hitting it with that little mini hair
[SPEAKER_21]: straightener and making that first hash
Rosin that was from that tack.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're like, yeah, wrap it in the screen.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wrap it in the screen.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I mean, Space and I were sitting
down there in Oakland at the Bazaar and
[SPEAKER_23]: just enjoying pressing some Rosin,
you know, kind of soul groans method where
[SPEAKER_23]: you take a chunk of hash and you press it
together under some lower heat,
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, so it's nice and tight together
and then you press that and then you get
[SPEAKER_23]: this nice halo.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you could take like a three star
and turn it into a four star Rosin
[SPEAKER_23]: basically at that point, you know,
and Space and I were sitting out back.
[SPEAKER_23]: We're like, man, we need something to make
this better, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_23]: well, we need a filter.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a filter is what we need.
[SPEAKER_23]: And he's like, I got a filter.
[SPEAKER_23]: And he ran into his hash lab and grabbed
the 25 micron pressing screen and the rest
[SPEAKER_23]: is history, man.
[SPEAKER_23]: We pressed up some, you know, six star out
of four star at that point.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Turn it to just get the oil out,
right?
[SPEAKER_21]: It definitely was an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: It still is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: After that episode, there was not a
company selling a Rosin press.
[SPEAKER_21]: But after the hash church episode 25 that
he came on and talked about it,
[SPEAKER_21]: there were machines like D-Nail had a
machine like a week or two later.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was just a T-shirt press with with an
additional heater on the on the top as
[SPEAKER_21]: well as the bottom.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, you know, Sasquatch stepped it
up and came out.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're welders.
[SPEAKER_21]: We know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_21]: They built a solid unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: That thing was like untouchable.
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, pure pressure coming out,
you know, after that with this incredibly
[SPEAKER_21]: engineered unit that had all of these
features and emergency stops and plate
[SPEAKER_21]: controls and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get into that soon when we talk to
those guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to finish the introductions off.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one left.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Mark over at Covert Extracts.
[SPEAKER_21]: You are the last one.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I'll go through the companies
that made it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think Sasquatch made it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll see if they got the email or not.
[SPEAKER_21]: It'd be nice to hear from them.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_21]: They said they had really bad service and
their Internet might be too slow to join.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that might be Mark.
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you there from Covert Extracts?
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you off again?
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we'll have to hear from you later
if not.
[SPEAKER_21]: If he's not there, what I'll do is I'll
put this video.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's hear from you real quick.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I'll put the video on of soil
grown.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kind of figuring out this whole
Zoom thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So don't worry about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I started growing probably back
like in, say, the mid to late 90s and been
[SPEAKER_18]: growing on and off ever since then.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been growing like steadily for
probably the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I really, I first seen
rosin, I think, on YouTube, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not really sure who I first seen it
from, but it was on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I got an Instagram page and I
found soil grown solventless and
[SPEAKER_18]: solventless mine.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, that's where I really
started getting into it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And now I make rosin pretty much.
[SPEAKER_18]: I make a lot of single source,
but I also make stuff for our team over at
[SPEAKER_18]: Goat Butcher Farm.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's who we're going to be going
into the legal market with going forward.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we make rosin kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this is, this was made with no oven.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was kind of like trying to find a way to
make the like sauce consistency with no
[SPEAKER_18]: oven.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I found out that if you press with
just a little bit higher temperature and,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, just a quick press and then
throw it onto the mats, you can get the
[SPEAKER_18]: same consistency as the oven without
actually cooking it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's going to be a lot of what
we're talking about today is consistency
[SPEAKER_21]: and techniques and methodologies and
creating these, you know, obviously the
[SPEAKER_21]: resin itself has its own subtle nuances
and factors that are at play.
[SPEAKER_21]: But within those, you know, all of these
different methodologies that can bring us
[SPEAKER_21]: these different textures is I want to get
into for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you have a lot.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to be hearing from you
quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to introduce soil grown,
soil grown, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think every single person on this panel
right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Lock you up, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just like to start with you.
[SPEAKER_21]: With the standing ovation, like heavy ice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Glad to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just going to play the video of you
talking from the episode of Rosin 25.
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to go here real quick?
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We should have him reenact it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We should have him reenact it.
[SPEAKER_21]: You might not remember it exactly,
but here it is.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that baby face.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't hear it, though.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my little bubble hash machine right
there in the background, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just barely starting to get
down.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I wanted to play this, but I don't
think it's... I'm going to stop sharing
[SPEAKER_21]: for now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try to see if I can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, tell us what's up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us the story again.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us how it all started, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the All Rosin episode,
and every single person on the panel
[SPEAKER_21]: shouted you out so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do much love from everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick lineup right now, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely recognize everybody on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I used to be big into solvent
extracts, making them and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even really know much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember going back to Amsterdam in 2009
and falling in love with bubble,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I didn't really know much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just fell in love with concentrates out
here, and all I knew about was BHO
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how to blast in all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on down the road, I fucked up,
promised my family I'd never do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of my buddies had told me
about fucking water hashing shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I started researching on it and seeing
all bubble man's threads, nicotine,
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt rise, just other people popping up
through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very vague knowledge, but it was enough to
put you on a track to start experimenting
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to figure shit out on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started washing trim and getting
decent hash and just wasn't what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing on the internet and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally started getting fresh frozen
and got a lot closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started refining that and pulling
six star and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So later on down the road, I run out of
all my melts, and that's what really
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed me to try figuring shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember doing the Jermichels,
you throw the fucking melt on the screen
[SPEAKER_02]: and then watch it melt through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see all that fucking contaminant
stuck on the top, but the oil would fall
[SPEAKER_02]: through always.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I would think about that all the
time, but nothing really came of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you go later on down the road
and running out of my six star melts and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking light bulb goes off in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just thinking like, okay,
so I took a chunk of hash shoved it
[SPEAKER_02]: between a piece of parchment and push it
up on the email and like help burn my
[SPEAKER_02]: finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I pull it off and I
looked, I see oil pushing out the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tripped me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me like 10 minutes to get one
person to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually that idea came from the fact
is when I was making hash, I would press
[SPEAKER_02]: out like four star, five star,
three star, just some shitty shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I preferred to dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it wasn't the best way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember seeing Nickatee using the
hair straightener just to thin it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would mess up all the time,
wouldn't think anything of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, thinking back, you know,
you had the, when I pressed it too hard,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the outside all oily and shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see the dry flat contaminant
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would just fold it back up,
do it again and dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's where later down the
road, that light bulb kicks on and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I graduated to a hair curler because
that's all I could find in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my wife comes out, flips out on
me and brings me an old hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was on from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we started pressing the shit out
of hash, no screen, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't refined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just pick out as much of the
contaminant as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically ran out of my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another light bulb goes off in the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grab a bud and it worked with the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to our surprise,
we're fucking amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next thing you know, we're smoking
flower rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I remember like that night,
dude, breaking out the hair straightener
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fucking pound of weed and pressing
out my first eighth of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took us like four hours to press it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the fact that we had this stable,
clear, just, I mean, looking back now to
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have now, like we're calling it
terpy, but that shit was burnt popcorn,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but loving every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, that's really how it
begun for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, cannabis revenue came
around and showed everyone the screen tech
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just refined the fuck out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really that was like, the biggest game
changer as far as refining the rosin.
[SPEAKER_23]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_23]: Couldn't have done it without you.
[SPEAKER_23]: So standing on your shoulders,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All up, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, it's such an incredible story.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was, I remember this, like how it was
like on Instagram, like a wildfire and
[SPEAKER_21]: then how like companies started popping up
right after we did, or you,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shut it down.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just let me know and I'll mute you
first.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, look at Jendo came in too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on Jendo?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking about you,
Jen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Easter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only stay on for a couple of minutes
because I got a kid and a man in the house
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like, why the fuck are you on the
phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, guys, it's hash church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I got four girls waiting on me.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got mine as well waiting out there,
but we all rosin episode.
[SPEAKER_21]: We had to persevere.
[SPEAKER_21]: We had to persevere.
[SPEAKER_21]: Introductions, Jen, if you want to do a
quick little introduction, tell us how you
[SPEAKER_21]: found rosin and tell us a little bit about
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what we kind of just did.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're, you're the last on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I remember rosin coming up
when we did the first episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that we brought it up in, uh,
the friend of mine had actually been like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, have you seen this rosin shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You take flowers and you squish them with
your hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grabbed some flour and did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my God, this is going
to take me like all day to get us like two
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs, but it worked and it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I heard about Phil swell
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked about him on hash
church and I was like, look, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, being a girl, I had plenty of hair
straighteners cause I had three kids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we got some, some awesome
things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of people sent me like the
innovative tech on how to, how to properly
[SPEAKER_00]: use the straightening iron and just good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the presses came out,
fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I've been, I've been here since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_21]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got just a couple of more people who
are representing a couple of companies.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sasquatch, I guess, hasn't been able to
make it in because they are camping in
[SPEAKER_21]: Arizona somewhere and they have bad
internet.
[SPEAKER_21]: But, uh, why don't we hear from,
uh, Cliff Haney who's over at,
[SPEAKER_21]: uh, pure pressure, pure pressure.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_24]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_24]: So, uh, as you said, my name's Cliff.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm right here representing pure pressure
today just to give you a little background
[SPEAKER_24]: on how I got into the business.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, so when I was 14, that's basically
when my passion for cannabis started.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, my mom's got Parkinson's Tourette's
and fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_24]: So seeing how it helped her, um,
in a medicinal sense really sparked my
[SPEAKER_24]: passion.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we started looking for better
alternatives to the kind of the mids that
[SPEAKER_24]: she had access to at the time that were
really just tearing her throat up.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, so we heard about this lady,
her name was Cheryl, I think in,
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, Netherland, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_24]: And she taught us about RSO, Rick Simpson
oil.
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we started making that for,
started sourcing some real heavy Indica
[SPEAKER_24]: dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but it was just making her so sleepy
and sedated that she really couldn't treat
[SPEAKER_24]: herself throughout the day with it.
[SPEAKER_24]: It was mostly just at nighttime that she
was really able to take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_24]: So we started looking at other
concentrates out there, um, found BHO kind
[SPEAKER_24]: of went through the whole mess of turning
Pyrex into a rocket.
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, so we had some, some tough mistakes
that we had to learn some lessons on
[SPEAKER_24]: there.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, you know, we discovered solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_24]: I found the guys over at pure pressure,
um, super stoked to be working with them.
[SPEAKER_24]: We've got an incredible team over there.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, it really all started with,
with Josh, one of our owners was looking
[SPEAKER_24]: for a better solution to press rosin.
[SPEAKER_24]: And so he contacted one of his friends who
was an engineer, uh, Ben Britain.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know if any of you guys know
Ben, but he's basically the, the Elon Musk
[SPEAKER_24]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, if you could see his vision for
the future and kind of what we're looking
[SPEAKER_24]: to do with solid list is, is really just
scale it and automated in every way.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and really just drive that price point
down to where it's more competitive with
[SPEAKER_24]: some of these other extracts out there.
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and that's going to take just
improving the efficiency of the equipment,
[SPEAKER_24]: finding better strains out there to
process.
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's just our ultimate goal to
really push solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, we, we don't care what,
what equipment you're using or what you're
[SPEAKER_24]: doing just as, you know, as long as you're
pushing solvent list forward, we're,
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, we're definitely on the same team.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I didn't know that about your mom.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a heavy duty for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's neat to see all the different
journeys.
[SPEAKER_21]: To get us all to a similar place,
uh, here on hash church in the all rosin
[SPEAKER_21]: episode.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got 641 people watching hash church
3.0 episode seven.
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's a bunch of people in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll end up asking questions from them as
well.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I want to hear from Spencer Spencer's
from, uh, access rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I found this rosin press to,
to just be different and to be innovative.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, I, I kind of appreciated what he
was doing.
[SPEAKER_21]: And even now looking at his, uh,
picture of the rosin giant triplets
[SPEAKER_21]: dripping behind them.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us about yourself, Spencer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us about how you came to be here in
this room today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, definitely rosin was the, the new
hype, uh, back in 2015 when I was hosting
[SPEAKER_12]: my booth at chalice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, uh, that was actually 2017 and,
um, I, uh, got in contact with Dave at
[SPEAKER_12]: rosin technologies, who is kind of a
company that goes undescribed when,
[SPEAKER_12]: when learning about rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I'd know that they discovered was
adequate pounds per square inch.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they found quality in flower rosin
at small scale with large pressure,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, because of the fast oil movement
through the filtration screens.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found that to be very unique.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, and when, when I was pressing,
with one of their machines at,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, secret sessions and, and high times
and whatnot, I, uh, I, I was able to see a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of different genetics and how they
extracted and, and what the oil contents
[SPEAKER_12]: were becoming.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the problem was scalability.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just could not process enough
material at a large enough scale.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I actually tried to develop some new
plates for that press that they were using
[SPEAKER_12]: and it did not work the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that was when a little light bulb
went off in my head to say, Oh,
[SPEAKER_12]: adequate pounds per square inch is,
is a huge factor with pressing flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they apparently became a thing
pressing hash where it's kind of simpler
[SPEAKER_12]: because there's no plant material creating
a separation, uh, between the plates.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't need as much pressure to
easily extract the oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my whole intent for this was
scalability.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a, a nonprofit organization back in
2013 that I wanted to provide a quality
[SPEAKER_12]: product to all of my patients because I
was growing everything, uh, in house for,
[SPEAKER_12]: for all the patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were a true nonprofit that would not
buy and sell any cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would just cultivate it all in
houses as myself as a grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I just looked to create quality
material and, uh, with extracts coming
[SPEAKER_12]: into the picture, um, concentrates for,
for patients who needed such a high level
[SPEAKER_12]: of THC or CBD that mechanical separation
was kind of the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when, when they released the,
the press from, uh, rosin technologies,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, I jumped on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's when, again, I just,
I just lean towards scalability and,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, creating a simple process from,
from harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: To rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and so I began inventing, I have seven
different prototypes that essentially came
[SPEAKER_12]: to the V 3.2 behind me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, I found out that this was the
most simplest way to, uh, scale up rosin
[SPEAKER_12]: in my vision.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is just my vision,
uh, come to light in a machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm, you know, now bringing it to
the industry after I got rated in 2017 and
[SPEAKER_12]: my nonprofit was completely shut down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I sold my hydroponic store and decided
to, uh, basically help more patients in
[SPEAKER_12]: what my nonprofit was helping,
uh, by, by providing scalable equipment to
[SPEAKER_12]: try to, uh, basically flood the entire
industry with mechanically separate or
[SPEAKER_12]: separated oil verse a solvent based oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, just as everybody said, like that was
the first point of view of, of bad oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was something in there that none of us
are really scientists that we could
[SPEAKER_12]: explain, but something wasn't as clean as,
uh, mechanically separated oil.
[SPEAKER_21]: So interesting to explain it right away.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like on day one, he was like, it's
mercaptans.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're in the butane.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're in the, all the canisters.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a contaminant.
[SPEAKER_21]: It ends up concentrating in the oil.
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and people just didn't want to hear
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were like, Oh no, this is,
I got the mercaptan free.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, my butane is actually really clean.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was just like, it was like an
incredible like array of self delusional,
[SPEAKER_21]: um, cognitive dissonance, if you will,
from a big part of the community that
[SPEAKER_21]: claimed to be about patients, but I think
was really just about blasting cans of BHO
[SPEAKER_21]: through PVC pipes and selling the sludge
that came out the other end.
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, as Johnny B wrote,
uh, on the title of one of his infamous,
[SPEAKER_21]: uh, YouTube videos, rosin, the death of
BHO.
[SPEAKER_21]: And when he wrote that, like a lot of
people were very like offended by it
[SPEAKER_21]: almost.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_21]: But man, I'll tell you, maybe it's just my
feeds.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see BHO at all anymore.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see the BHO characters that were
all in the community.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't see really any of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of going away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the real key to making it
completely go away is creating scalable
[SPEAKER_12]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, like Cliff was saying, man,
just creating the equipment for the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry is, is a start to providing
quality oil for the entire world.
[SPEAKER_12]: It starts with the manufacturers and the
facilities acquiring the proper equipment
[SPEAKER_12]: to create scalability, regardless of what
form it's from, as long as it's from
[SPEAKER_12]: flower rosin or hash rosin, or some type
of, uh, hash process that separates the
[SPEAKER_12]: resin gland, uh, through sieve or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're definitely all interested.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, I just see that full melt through
rosin or, or a rosin product, essentially
[SPEAKER_12]: that, that has the best melting terms,
um, is going to stay long-term for we're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking past the next 10, 15 years,
like butane essentially had a,
[SPEAKER_12]: a ending point.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that with, with rosin and hash,
uh, it's, it's all for us to not only have
[SPEAKER_12]: the start in 2015 to innovate new products
and, and develop new equipment,
[SPEAKER_12]: but to continue past, uh, uh, seeing no
ending point.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, let me just check out the entire
room here to make sure nobody snuck in
[SPEAKER_21]: while I was, uh, I wish I could have
played that video of you soil grown,
[SPEAKER_21]: telling the story from years ago,
but I'll have to, I'll have to figure it
[SPEAKER_21]: out later.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not, it doesn't come out with any
audio, but now I really kind of want to
[SPEAKER_21]: open it up to discussion.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think one of the most
important discussions, uh, leads into
[SPEAKER_21]: techniques and techniques basically equal
textures.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't that really what techniques sort of
basically creating textures, you're
[SPEAKER_17]: creating textures, consistencies,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: And everyone's trying to come up with kind
of new versions of these things.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to say through all of the
experimenting and all of the mistakes that
[SPEAKER_21]: have been made, some pretty, some pretty
beautiful things have come up.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, you know, the, the figuring out
of THC a or you know, the separation of
[SPEAKER_21]: the THC from the Terps, you know,
having it crash inside the jar,
[SPEAKER_21]: both those techniques seem to be also once
again, spread like wildfire, give people
[SPEAKER_21]: that ability to go home and sort of try
things.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to open that up.
[SPEAKER_21]: How some of you got turned onto that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the things you did that were
mistakes that led to doing things that
[SPEAKER_21]: were correct.
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyone has a story like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's been by mistake for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say like from,
from the, like, try to think of the
[SPEAKER_07]: person's perspective that has never made
anything like this or, or, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe even indulged on anything like the,
the, even the end product, like what
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking two heated plates and you
know, like they don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to, can we start at that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like before we start explaining
consistency and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't you start like just like what
you were saying, the simple thing we're
[SPEAKER_21]: using heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're using either flower or hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're hitting that flower hash with heat
and pressure with originally a flat iron
[SPEAKER_21]: or a hair straightener, which led into
t-shirt presses modified, which led into
[SPEAKER_21]: presses modified.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and we're extracting the active
components of the cannabis flower or hash,
[SPEAKER_21]: the resin glands, um, into a refined oil.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're refining the oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like maybe just maybe we shouldn't be
saying that we're curing it because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: two heated plates are initiating all the
consistencies, even fresh press,
[SPEAKER_07]: the consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fresh press that's initiated by two
really hot plates, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like let's not just be real.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_21]: The turkey printouts before and after,
like the changes are minimal, surprising
[SPEAKER_21]: the way the assumptions once again,
from the BHO community who were like,
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my God, like they're using heated
plates.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, it's coming out really
great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the consistencies are similar to the,
to the hydrocarbon extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to say
like people like me to understand that,
[SPEAKER_07]: that aren't making it because they're
buying things that say cold cured or heat
[SPEAKER_07]: cured or whatever.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're curing the rosin afterwards,
you're slowing down the off-gassing of
[SPEAKER_21]: terpenes to allow it to harden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will save terpenes more so than it
wouldn't had you bought.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: The act of pressing rosin itself is not
curing rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would, I would agree as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a post-process that, you know,
that you, you go through after the actual
[SPEAKER_16]: process and which gives it that title.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people here on the chat actually
mentioned that they offer a fresh press,
[SPEAKER_22]: a cold cure, a warm cure, an oven cure.
[SPEAKER_22]: The curing is nothing to do with the
press.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all post-processing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind that at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like people can call it, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what you guys just said,
it totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if that is the word that people want to
use, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my word that I use is,
you know, very figurative.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use the word bloom because anything that
I make is coming off of two really hot
[SPEAKER_07]: plates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it does after that, you know,
that was the initiation of the
[SPEAKER_07]: consistency, whatever consistency I made,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, it came down the temps a
little bit, but, you know, it's still a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit above room temp.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you're trying to make the,
whatever consistency you're trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: make, you know, like people put it in the
oven, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be the guy that defines
the term that we're... Open the content up
[SPEAKER_07]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps we could use an analogy.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's like recordings,
you know, making music where you could
[SPEAKER_16]: have a recording and then you have genres
and then sub genres.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that those, the recording is like
the process.
[SPEAKER_16]: The genre is the cold cure in this case.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you take it a step further and
you have harmonics and the timing in which
[SPEAKER_16]: all of the things come together,
the screen you use, the timing,
[SPEAKER_16]: the heat, and all these things that you
apply to this.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then your genres are different.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you have hip hop, you have jazz,
you have, you know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to take that in,
I think that's a good analogy that you
[SPEAKER_16]: could think about moving forward as,
you know, it's trying to better understand
[SPEAKER_16]: in a human sense what we're actually doing
to give to someone.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what is this thing?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's rosin, but it's, you know,
I cold cured it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore it's a process in which it
went through to give you the cold cure.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we can look at it in that
manner and really apply this, these same
[SPEAKER_16]: analogies in that way, if you will.
[SPEAKER_22]: Curing of rosin to me is much in the same
sense as, as curing a flower.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, you're actually maturing the
resin glands, you're allowing them to
[SPEAKER_22]: potentially oxidize, to mature for the
trichomes or for the for the terpenes to,
[SPEAKER_22]: to progress.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's, that's curing to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's different ways to skin a cat,
so to speak, to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: different results from curing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just to be the person on the other
side that like, keep in mind, like people
[SPEAKER_07]: that have never made it before,
to them, to them, they're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, so are you using dry material?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you cured the material,
the flower, you cured it, then you made
[SPEAKER_07]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you using fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you're using, you know,
but, so let's, let's say you are using dry
[SPEAKER_07]: material and you're teaching someone
that's never made it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cured material.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're refining the oil of a
cured, cured resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: The resin's cured.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're refining cured resin already.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're curing that cured,
cured, cured resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what, like from a perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would just be developing at
that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: The resin is just developing.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think most people that are talking about
curing the resin glands aren't,
[SPEAKER_22]: aren't, and maybe I'm totally wrong on
this, but the people that are talking
[SPEAKER_22]: about curing rosin aren't washing dried,
cured flower.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're, we're washing either fresh frozen,
or in my case, I've moved to more of a
[SPEAKER_22]: four, five, six day dry.
[SPEAKER_22]: So curing of the, of the resin glands has
not taken place prior to me pressing the
[SPEAKER_22]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a necessity.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can smoke fresh pressed rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to be that linear about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just an example.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like let's say fresh frozen.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that freezer is drying out that
material.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when did you get it?
[SPEAKER_07]: That material, how dry, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all data.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the point is, is that two heated
plates, refined oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like, I mean, maybe the word cure
shouldn't be the word, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: People can use that word because it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to explain it that way,
totally fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use the word bloom because I'm really,
and when you expose coffee to heat,
[SPEAKER_07]: just a little bit of heat, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It like muffins up just like VHL in the
vacuum oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like back in the day, you're making
chatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It muffins up and it starts to bloom,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I'm just putting a word on a
process that I don't feel like explaining
[SPEAKER_07]: in depth to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I just brand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the rosin blooms in a jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that is is your brand.
[SPEAKER_23]: You're blooming it for your brand,
you know?
[SPEAKER_23]: And the reality is there's a rainbow of
different types of rosin out there.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I prefer to run dry trim still.
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I'm probably one of the last
holdouts that loves the dry trim,
[SPEAKER_23]: but I'm all about that cured resin head,
you know?
[SPEAKER_23]: And then that rosin that's made from that
cured bubble hash, it goes through another
[SPEAKER_23]: process where I'm changing the texture so
that it's going to be a more desirable
[SPEAKER_23]: product for the end consumer, you know?
[SPEAKER_23]: And so there's all these things that can
go down.
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want to just call it bloom,
that's cool, but the reality is,
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, did you dry your plants
afterwards?
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes or no, that's one thing, right?
[SPEAKER_23]: How long did you dry them for?
[SPEAKER_23]: How did you dry them for?
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you dry them in cold dark or was it a
quick dry?
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you then just hold them in a sealed
container or was it able to off gas fully?
[SPEAKER_23]: There's all of these things under the
rainbow and they're all going to create
[SPEAKER_23]: different wonderful products.
[SPEAKER_23]: So that was very well said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's cool about like what we do is
it's like a branding thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody can stamp their own label on it,
call it what you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Covert's got his new, I think he
calls them the asteroids or the space
[SPEAKER_08]: balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Rackham's, you got the zombie rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's got their own thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to coin it their own thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as long as you can explain it
properly and give the consumer a
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable explanation for what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I say, call it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_27]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do wash cured resin and I can agree with
Pedro.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I also wanted to say that I like to
store my rosin in a cold environment to
[SPEAKER_27]: preserve it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_27]: There's definitely a change going on over
time.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that's why I definitely could say
it falls under curing, but I don't store
[SPEAKER_27]: it in a cold environment to par se cure
it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do it to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's kind of like one of my mistakes,
if you will, is I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I used to keep it in the freezer
to preserve it like long-term,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, if I wanted to keep it,
you know, six, eight, 10 months or so,
[SPEAKER_22]: which I now think is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_22]: But when I put it in the refrigerator to
kind of as a staging area, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: most of my rosin unfortunately sits on the
desk here.
[SPEAKER_22]: I smoke it rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_22]: I put it in containers that I go through
it rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I use my little six can refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of a warm refrigerator,
if you will, just keeps things rather
[SPEAKER_22]: cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just kept it in there because I like to
keep my rosin cool for preservation.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I noticed the change.
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed the buttering.
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed the pooling of the turps on the
top.
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed the separation.
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed the nucleation.
[SPEAKER_22]: I always say that word wrong.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I started noticing a change and that
was what turned me on to the curing.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was what I guess I'll just,
maybe I termed it or maybe I whatever made
[SPEAKER_22]: up the word.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I cured, I figured I cured my rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was aging it.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was changing.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was morphing.
[SPEAKER_27]: I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I use the same kind of refrigerator as
you described.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't store it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't like how much condensation and how
aggressive the freezer is.
[SPEAKER_27]: It like dries things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the freezer only for complete
preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, the refrigerator,
I would say, is still, in a sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: curing because there's still oxidation
occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's super slowed down process
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like Pedro was saying,
you know, it's still changing and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it at such a slow rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we have it out of the
refrigerator and when we're doing our
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulation process, we're, in a sense,
just speeding up oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we're applying heat to it,
we're just speeding up that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it gets to a point where
you really have to monitor it when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for a certain texture consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it's in the fridge, there is no
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a hell of a lot more time to see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're trying to store things in
the refrigerator, you can't expect it to
[SPEAKER_02]: look exactly the same when you go to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to package it or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have bulk material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to package.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want it to be fresh pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now there's nucleation occurring
throughout it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not what you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really believe in the fact that the
freezer is the best way for storage to
[SPEAKER_02]: almost completely stop oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the refrigerator, it's great storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short term, you know, it'll keep fresh,
fresh looking good for a short time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you will see nucleation occur and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really strain dependent,
you know, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're strains that are super stable and
just seem to hold very well and stay clear
[SPEAKER_02]: and fresh pressed looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, some strains, as everyone
knows, you know, they just they nucleate
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of refrigeration or what you
did.
[SPEAKER_18]: It just depends on what temperature of
pressing you had also.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say it reminds me of good
chefs will know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm not a chef.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I don't want to speak for other
chefs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they know that the rice is better
to make fried rice with day old rice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like that fridge definitely is
doing something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's preserving, obviously.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's some there's stuff going on in
the fridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it makes a better fried rice day
old.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just a really ridiculous
example.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say that, like,
from my opinion, from from my perspective
[SPEAKER_07]: of how I make it like shot out low temp
plates, I just makes it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got good feedback with them and never
had a problem with the plates.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, I squeeze the rice in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I make that I make the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I actually just leave it a little
bit above the seed mat.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I put it on a seed mat.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrap it in aluminum.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine showed me that would be
kind of a good idea just because of the
[SPEAKER_07]: photo oxidation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I want to kind of limit that if
you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just from like a totally crude way of
doing what I'm doing, I just explaining
[SPEAKER_07]: from my perspective, could picture to
picture people that are just growing six
[SPEAKER_07]: plants and they don't follow all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just like, OK, how can I
refine my hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like that's how I'm kind of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so anyways, I put it on a seed mat and
I let it bloom because I don't I don't let
[SPEAKER_07]: that that top.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sealed jar, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what am I getting out here?
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, so I get at it a couple of days
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I don't pop the seal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you pop that seal,
you know, it's like because there's like
[SPEAKER_07]: D02 or whatever else is being released.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like it's blooming almost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, well, when you're when you're
melting the the the resin on the nail,
[SPEAKER_07]: that the bubbling, that's CO2 being
released, if I'm mistaken.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Terps and CO2.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, so that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just leave it on there for like
sometimes it's two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on like what you guys are
saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of some of that waxed out quicker.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like a banana is kind of like the
best example of stuff with limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard from the people that make
Solvinex, Murphy Murray, I think that's
[SPEAKER_07]: her Instagram name, Murphy Murray.
[SPEAKER_07]: She told me that limonene actually
extracts the that terpene extracts the I
[SPEAKER_07]: mean, melts the or somehow extracts
cannabinoids more.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Horatio does LHO with limonene,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Limonene hash oil or something like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: He was doing that years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these consistency like like,
for example, I had a one seed plant we
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't able to keep, unfortunately,
but it made oil that like whenever I
[SPEAKER_07]: pressed into the rosin, there was nothing
you could do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could put it in an oven, nothing you
could do to make it wax out at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing you could do to do
anything to make it turn into what I would
[SPEAKER_07]: say that I make on the regular,
which is like what I was trying to say
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just leave it in a jar for two days and
then I pop the seal and then I stir just a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit and then it all kind of turns
into what I was trying to say earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they do it just like me,
but that's how I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I mean by like.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for sharing, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to we're going to move on from
this conversation and kind of get into a
[SPEAKER_21]: little bit of sort of textures and
technologies to get to those particular
[SPEAKER_21]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_21]: There is certain resin that, like you say,
it's just going to mutate right away.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just going to butter out.
[SPEAKER_21]: We had it in the hash world forever
because it was even worse in the hash
[SPEAKER_21]: world because water also tended to do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you had water being left in the hash,
making it kind of butter out and weaken
[SPEAKER_21]: and get funky.
[SPEAKER_21]: But then you had people drying their hash
to perfection, but it was really high
[SPEAKER_21]: token and really high THC.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it would basically sugar out and crash
right within itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys figure out any ways to sort of
recognize those things?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would I feel like, you know,
that would be moisture, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, presenting oxygen and just
speeding up oxidized oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's just kind of that
sense of which is is inducing nucleation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feel like that's kind of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the same with any kind of oil,
whether it's, you know, bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: which which has more plant particulate,
which is able to absorb and hold on to
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture better than like a pure oil
rosin, which you know, it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's more like inducing nucleation to
things like heat and and oxidate oxidation
[SPEAKER_02]: on that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like it's oxidation inducing
nucleation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you get that crumbled up
sugar or, you know, shit's taking up on
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's also, you know, the way the flour
was grown before it was extracted,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, what they did and didn't do,
you know, every time you started a hundred
[SPEAKER_16]: percent, if you get below that ten percent
mark on the cultivation side, it's just
[SPEAKER_16]: tough.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you're going to have a lot more
waxes and a lot more stuff in there that
[SPEAKER_16]: are undesirable in terms of the head
itself.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the biggest thing I always try
to tell cultivators out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to really be careful what you're
feeding your plants and when you're
[SPEAKER_16]: feeding it as well and how much you're
feeding it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all together.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not one after the other.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a singular thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's trifecta you have to really bring
together.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I totally agree on that, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about preservation right
now, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like at the end of the day, we're talking
about preservation and shelf life.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's what our end goal is,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: At what point does it become degradation?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, is that oxidation causing
degradation?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the less oxidation you can
introduce and, you know, if you can do
[SPEAKER_16]: hermetically sealed jars after you're done
and, you know, you can off gas as much as
[SPEAKER_16]: you can to get that seal on there to try
to bring it to the customer as we see it
[SPEAKER_16]: in the lab.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's a tall order.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's not the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's where these consistencies
came from.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: In a sense, a lot of people in mistakes
are trying to see how long they can
[SPEAKER_17]: preserve their product for, which ended up
turning into a different consistency
[SPEAKER_17]: because they store it different than this
person or that person.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a fail over the last year that kind
of falls into these kinds of conversations
[SPEAKER_22]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_22]: I took about a half pound of some really
good rosin that I had and just not knowing
[SPEAKER_22]: the consistencies, not knowing changes,
not knowing what was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_22]: I wrapped an imparchment paper.
[SPEAKER_22]: I vacuum sealed it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I put it in a sealed PVC container capsule
and prepper style.
[SPEAKER_22]: I buried it in my backyard for a period of
about six or eight months.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, just rainy day type stuff.
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys all know, we all put stuff in
different places.
[SPEAKER_22]: So anyways, that was this last year's
harvest and spring came up upon us about a
[SPEAKER_22]: month ago.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went out and I was like, man,
it's about time to dig this up,
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, and just see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_22]: I could use the stash anyways,
so it's time to start bringing it in and
[SPEAKER_22]: preparing it.
[SPEAKER_22]: When I brought it in and opened the PVC
container, by the way, did I say it was
[SPEAKER_22]: vacuum sealed?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's wrapped in parchment, vacuum sealed,
buried in the ground.
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I opened up the PVC container,
pulled out the vacuum sealed, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: baggie, and I immediately noticed that
there was moisture leaking from the
[SPEAKER_22]: inside, from the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_22]: And just me knowing the rosin that I've
seen, you know, that I'd had in here,
[SPEAKER_22]: immediately knew that it was bleeding
terpenes, just knew it was bleeding
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I peeled open the first one and they
were all wrapped in, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: one ounce little pucks.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I immediately opened it up and it was
a nightmare to collect.
[SPEAKER_22]: The terpenes were just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_22]: For every ounce that I had, I ended up
collecting about 24 to 25 grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the rest was pretty much just terpenes
that I had to try to collect and spread
[SPEAKER_22]: amongst everything.
[SPEAKER_22]: So on that fail, you know, if you're gonna
do any kind of cold curing or anything,
[SPEAKER_22]: definitely make sure it's in a kind of a
glass, a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_22]: I recommend glass, highly recommend glass.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was my fail and really what
turned me on to, holy shit, this is
[SPEAKER_22]: curing, this is separating, this is
nucleizing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't say that word right.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it was in a sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the oxidation was very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my story.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm loving listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that little story there,
I see the separation a lot on the terps on
[SPEAKER_03]: the outside of the things that I've
stored.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have jars dated right now from March
2008 I'm gonna look at and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But moisture is such a huge role.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really looking at humidity,
moisture, water activity and how it plays
[SPEAKER_03]: a key role in storing hash, rosin,
everything pretty much.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pressing rosin, we haven't even talked
about it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't mentioned it yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: The one thing that didn't get mentioned
was moisture content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosin, moisture content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really I've seen such a difference,
even like just stuff I just recently
[SPEAKER_03]: pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we're talking about, some is
burning out, some's not, some is,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it really comes down to moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really see some dries out quicker,
some doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I cure, the way I store really,
I see moisture playing a key role in
[SPEAKER_03]: everything we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_18]: It has a lot to do with temperature also.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like if you press it at a lower
temperature, it'll butter up faster.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you press it at a hotter
temperature, it'll stay stable longer and
[SPEAKER_18]: it'll stay like more of that fresh press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like a hot short press, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, I would always like press a
couple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw in the beginning, I'd go like a
seven from Soegron.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I was a big, big fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for showing me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck, believe me, it changed my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was, I was always looking at the
shorter, longer presses, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for me, pressing on day four,
day five, curing and pulling that point,
[SPEAKER_03]: the turps right there and that moisture
plays a key role.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really saw that by pressing stuff
all the way through the drying process,
[SPEAKER_03]: even using bolito pressing, all the
moisture levels all the way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see the more contaminant is because
I'm always a fresh press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the different humidity levels
around the 67 mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, one relative humidity in the room
gives me a really nice press.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 72 is those days and that moisture is
really what I've been really paying
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: It comes to the part of the video where we
all need to hold up what we're smoking to
[SPEAKER_07]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I squeeze this in really quick?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't want to butcher Murphy
Murray's words.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I shouted her out, I totally,
I don't know this stuff, obviously,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as her.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that she is not gonna care that
I'm quoting her.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were in a group of people, we were
talking about limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say this really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun fact, the reason citrus flavors
contain more waxes is because omegas are
[SPEAKER_07]: very soluble in limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that batch doesn't necessarily have to
contain more waxes in the original plant
[SPEAKER_07]: matter, but they will be easier to extract
because the terpenes are behaving like the
[SPEAKER_07]: solvents they are and extracting more
waxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get those hashes up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's what I butchered earlier.
[SPEAKER_21]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for sharing, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Get your hash up.
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta have something here.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was great info, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate you telling everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got some Happy Valley hash right here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some square waves and some garlic.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I have some stuff I made at home
here, which is a triangle kush times
[SPEAKER_21]: sherbert, which is, I think it's time for
a dab.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Real quick, give everybody kind of just a
little warning I've seen in the past.
[SPEAKER_22]: Real quick little story.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're talking about cold curing,
especially taking our jars from the
[SPEAKER_22]: refrigerator and out and maybe storing
them in and dabbing them and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very important, I've found,
and even in a high desert condition that I
[SPEAKER_22]: am here with very low relative humidity,
to let your jar warm up to room
[SPEAKER_22]: temperature before you open it.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you pull your jar right out of the
refrigerator and open it and then put it
[SPEAKER_04]: back in.
[SPEAKER_22]: You left condensation inside the jar.
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, especially out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wipe it with a paper towel, let it warm,
and then wipe it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely gotta teach consumers that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super important because they're like,
you know, they'll go in for a dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's sizzling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could make that happen?
[SPEAKER_22]: A buddy of mine actually brought a jar
over that I had pressed for him and he was
[SPEAKER_22]: like, hey, why does this, there's like a
donut shape where the outer, the outside
[SPEAKER_22]: of the rosin was a different color than
any side of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I asked him, we finally deducted that
he was pulling it in and out of the
[SPEAKER_22]: refrigerator, sometimes the freezer,
to dab it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And he was getting oxygen or oxidation
condensation and it was literally mold.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's very important, you guys,
very important to let it warm up to room
[SPEAKER_22]: temperature if you're gonna store it in
the refrigerator prior to.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's another good tip for people that
are just starting out and pressing their
[SPEAKER_17]: hash wet.
[SPEAKER_17]: If somebody's hearing a sizzle while
they're pressing, stop.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because your shit's not dried yet.
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember when we used to talk about
pressing back on the hair straight and
[SPEAKER_22]: you'd go like, listen for the sizzle?
[SPEAKER_22]: It was like, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear something.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's a bad sound.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, pro tip right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just take my, you know, I put the
personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I put my personal stash in the
fridge and then I freeze bulk stuff with
[SPEAKER_07]: as little oxygen as possible, right,
in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then whenever I take out of the
fridge, I wait, I make some coffee,
[SPEAKER_07]: I fry an egg, and then I pop that seal.
[SPEAKER_26]: I would say it's always like, if you're
gonna put anything in the freezer to store
[SPEAKER_26]: it too, make sure, yeah, you have it in a
sealed jar, but make sure it goes into a
[SPEAKER_26]: plastic bag all the way sealed.
[SPEAKER_26]: Or back sealed or something like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: Even recently, about two weeks ago at
Single Source, I had my stand up freezer
[SPEAKER_26]: with all my jars go out in it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And like Adam was saying earlier,
you can get condensation built up in your
[SPEAKER_26]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_26]: I had some of that leak on top of all my
jars, but all of them safe, thankfully,
[SPEAKER_26]: because of the bag and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good tip for sure.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's a good tip for everyone.
[SPEAKER_26]: Always make sure you got sealed bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hash maker's tip right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the other thing I've been doing,
guys, is I've been induction sealing my
[SPEAKER_16]: jars.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I got these little tops here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: And these go right on top.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you just induction seal that right on
top.
[SPEAKER_16]: Think about it like peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_26]: We've been doing that with Single Source
jars as well, too.
[SPEAKER_26]: It takes like two seconds, man.
[SPEAKER_26]: A little induction sealer.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you just do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, I have stuff that I've
been testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've still got induction sealed from a
year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to wait another month and crack
it open, but I can already see it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, you know, as if I just put it in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to get on that.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to, you know, I think it's
just to share that I think about
[SPEAKER_16]: preservation a lot.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's one of those things where,
you know, I go to a lot of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_16]: all over the place just to kind of see
who's doing what.
[SPEAKER_16]: And every time I crack a jar, it's like
hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people that are really have super
flame.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know they're really talented.
[SPEAKER_16]: By the time I get it, it's just not the
same.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that is what Johnny B talks about,
that moisture content.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it speaks to what is the glue that
would use to seal that thing on top of the
[SPEAKER_21]: jar in the first place.
[SPEAKER_21]: And was it mixture of the of the moisture
content and the terpenes off gassing from
[SPEAKER_21]: the product, mixing into that little
space, slowly degrading that glue and
[SPEAKER_21]: releasing that seal.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's definitely happening with
flour here in the Canadian program and in
[SPEAKER_21]: our legal.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes the seals, the flour just comes
so dry that, you know, no company was
[SPEAKER_21]: drying their herb that dry to sell.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just that it was on the shelf for a
long time or it was in for a long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: The terpenes off gassing are consuming
that seal.
[SPEAKER_21]: I ask every LP, no one ever
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, that you that you're sealing the
garbage.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because terpenes consume all sorts of
things, particularly in particular,
[SPEAKER_21]: they're costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpenes got moisture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the less you have in the jars as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, people are putting a gram in
these giant jars and it oxidizes a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more oxygen present to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you need to fill the jar as much as you
can, especially for long term storage.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not afraid to put three grams in a
little seven mil jar, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: five grams in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people use these one ounce jars like
this and they put a gram in there or three
[SPEAKER_11]: grams in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just they oxidize way quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, look at it like a
two liter of soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when it's full, there's very
little head of oxygen in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It maintains its carbonation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets cracked open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of it gets poured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now there's a huge head of oxygen
in there, which allows that carbonation to
[SPEAKER_02]: fill, you know, because it's really empty
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that carbonation fills it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You crack it open and now that that gas is
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a sense, that's terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's happening with our
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good analogy right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I noticed that on a batter in a cold
cure that like that oxidizes more than
[SPEAKER_11]: anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, a lot of my favorite is the jam
because it keeps that I leave mine at a,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, room temp for weeks and it keeps
that same consistency.
[SPEAKER_11]: And somebody gets in there, it's still
nice and sugary and wet and terpy and it
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't have any color discoloration.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the jam is my favorite as far as,
you know, getting it to the consumer a
[SPEAKER_11]: month down the road when it's in their
hands, they still open it same
[SPEAKER_11]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, you know, got that dark kind of
crust on, not crust, but you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: that oxidization layer on the jam seems to
hold up well.
[SPEAKER_18]: So store this one right here for two
months.
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I like storing my bulk jars at
work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Filling them as much as possible,
you know, leaving a really small room for
[SPEAKER_14]: oxidation to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you really can avoid that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we store everything in a cold
environment in a small black box.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the jars are in a room that's 48
degrees, 50 degrees at best, and they
[SPEAKER_14]: never really see light until they're
getting packaged and they go immediately
[SPEAKER_14]: out, you know, to the shops and we make
sure they go to a fridge or somewhere
[SPEAKER_14]: that's going to be stored cold.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's definitely full
preservation.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have people asking me all the time,
how should I cure my bubble?
[SPEAKER_21]: Not as much.
[SPEAKER_21]: As much with rosin more, more with hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm always like, I'm always like very
simply, well, do you fall into the school
[SPEAKER_21]: of I want to preserve it?
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's exactly like it is now for as long
as possible, or I want things to change.
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's really like, it's,
it's kind of a one or the other for most
[SPEAKER_21]: people and the Instagram methodology of
popularizing this and driving it to those
[SPEAKER_21]: very pretty pictures with a very light
colored hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: Seems very much in line with preserve the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want it to be exactly how it was when
you took the picture.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to get it and be like,
oh, it's different.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it doesn't look like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_21]: Something's changed.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's interesting that we've really
done a full 180 from the sort of,
[SPEAKER_21]: from the, from the, the original,
the OGs who are more like cure,
[SPEAKER_21]: cure.
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to cure your, even when I first
learned about cured resin, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_21]: believe the difference of puffiness.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've been offing dabble, cured,
full mount dry sift with no mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like those are the same terpenes.
[SPEAKER_21]: We would evaporate off and cure in the
flower process in the seventies,
[SPEAKER_21]: eighties and nineties and two thousands.
[SPEAKER_21]: And those terpenes are fairly rough on the
throat.
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you, when you relieve the plant
of them, a new bouquet of sesquiturpenoids
[SPEAKER_21]: can uplift and kind of get under your
nose.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a different flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's that cured herb.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we've really flipped it on,
on, on hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's like, let's do some fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's freeze dry it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's hit it with super low temp rosin,
but then keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_21]: And, and I appreciate both sides,
but I wonder if one will dissipate.
[SPEAKER_21]: If the old will go to the point where we
can barely find it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like even having Brian talk about air
drying was, got me all excited today.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause that's, you know, soon to be
considered also a very old school
[SPEAKER_21]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, it's very neat to hear, to hear that
difference.
[SPEAKER_23]: Man, air drying is a tough thing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you're trying to pass a
microbial test.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it's, it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's yeast and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's things that live on plants,
you know, especially if they're grown
[SPEAKER_23]: outdoors, you know, and, and indoors
really for that matter.
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you've got a, that freeze dryer
is your best friend to help you,
[SPEAKER_23]: you pass those microbial tests.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're a business for sure,
if you're just a random person,
[SPEAKER_21]: very different.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think a lot of people in the,
in the bubble world that aren't
[SPEAKER_21]: necessarily in the business have felt like
they need to get themselves a freeze
[SPEAKER_21]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause that's, you know, all, all the
Instagram hashes freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_21]: I definitely, from a business perspective,
yeah, you definitely have to have one just
[SPEAKER_21]: like you should probably have an autoclave
to clean all the components of your water
[SPEAKER_21]: hash equipment.
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably you shouldn't be using plastic
washers and such.
[SPEAKER_21]: You should have stainless steel and,
and, and be able to absolutely all
[SPEAKER_21]: properly.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause everything changes when you go from
like Joe blow, I'm at home just making my
[SPEAKER_21]: own hash to I am entering the marketplace
and I'm going to also, you know,
[SPEAKER_23]: the, the freeze dryer is also like really
necessary for anything that's not dry
[SPEAKER_23]: cured trim.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if you're running fresh frozen,
I mean, sure people have been microplaning
[SPEAKER_23]: and doing things like that and bless all
the people that have gotten to the cured
[SPEAKER_23]: melts without having the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_23]: But the reality is man, like that stuff is
all fresh.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really, it's really susceptible to
mold.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: The freeze dries have been huge when it
comes to processing a ton of material at a
[SPEAKER_14]: time too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are days that we'll do 20,000 grams,
you know, in the cold room and thinking
[SPEAKER_14]: about having to go and see that and
everything and put it on racks would be a
[SPEAKER_14]: nightmare.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do have a friend up in Seattle that
does it.
[SPEAKER_14]: A headhunter extracts.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should check him out.
[SPEAKER_14]: He washes for compilation cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's air drying a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's having to take it through testing
and all that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he does a really great job.
[SPEAKER_14]: So feel free to check that guy out if
you're interested in learning how to do
[SPEAKER_14]: air drying techniques on a legal mass
scale, you know, gold leaf up here is also
[SPEAKER_23]: doing that same thing.
[SPEAKER_23]: They've been on the freeze dry tip.
[SPEAKER_16]: Freeze dry has really allowed it to scale.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the, you know, when I started
in the late nineties, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: it was, it's all I had, it's all there
was.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just air dry everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we didn't, at the time when
I started, it was, it was like patties.
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't even, we weren't even at the
point of microplaning yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just like, you put it in exactly,
you put it into a ball.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a mixture of like all these
techniques.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's my point is, you know,
we've, we've gotten to this place and I
[SPEAKER_16]: don't think one is better than the other.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think they're, they're,
they're tools that you can, you can really
[SPEAKER_16]: apply to the same methodology.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, freeze drying is definitely easier
and better from a perspective of if you
[SPEAKER_21]: don't have the time, the energy,
and the awareness that headhunter and the
[SPEAKER_21]: other person who was mentioned,
you know, there's a, there's a deeper
[SPEAKER_21]: level of awareness that needs to be
occurred now where you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, like maintain like mobile free,
water half or air dry like 20 kilos at a
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's, and then you have all the
microbial aspects that you have to fight
[SPEAKER_16]: against and it's, it's tech, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: You really got to know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got pictures of his room.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys should check it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got a lot of pictures and videos and
stuff of the room he works in and it's
[SPEAKER_14]: very impressive.
[SPEAKER_23]: Setup is awesome.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's, it's a, you know, it was really one
of the, it is the best facility I've seen
[SPEAKER_23]: yet.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_23]: I got to tour it a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: Headhunter extracts.
[SPEAKER_14]: He works for Constellation Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the lab manager there.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the man who does the freeze dry
method and the air dry method.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
I know.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the process is
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of helped build that place out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting the tour of that cold room was
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's very, very legit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They got everything you need for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you think, how do you guys think
this all reflects on the press?
[SPEAKER_17]: The freeze, dried method versus the air
dried method.
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think there's much of a difference
as far as the amount of oxidation that's
[SPEAKER_17]: already happened?
[SPEAKER_23]: Darker rosin with the air dryer,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_23]: The freeze dryer is going to preserve that
color, which is so important to so many
[SPEAKER_23]: people in the market is to have that
really light, blonde, just beautiful
[SPEAKER_23]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_23]: Even though some darker rosins can be just
amazingly tasty.
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_22]: And fresher terpenes, actually,
because in the drying process you're also
[SPEAKER_22]: curing.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're getting a little bit of a cured
resin there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a little bit of a fresher
taste, you know, when you use a freeze
[SPEAKER_22]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then myself, because I've failed so
many times at drying hash, air drying
[SPEAKER_22]: hash, there's a moisture content thing as
well.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a too soon, you know, so it kind
of takes that guesswork out of there.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've actually pressed hash before that
wasn't fully dry and ended up with wet
[SPEAKER_22]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a disappointment, you know?
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to hats off to you guys that air
dry, because it is an old school technique
[SPEAKER_22]: as far as I'm concerned, and I can't do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do look into investing in one of those,
especially next season, just to make it
[SPEAKER_07]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously I believe it's more
efficient to make hash with a freeze
[SPEAKER_07]: dryer, dry hash with a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make it very clear that
I've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dried fields of resin, and my max is
250 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not putting thousands of grams in a
freeze dryer and doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never made that much hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always done it in increments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do 400 grams, but I would hate my
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to live my best life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm staying at 250.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my max out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And grading all that hash is quite the
task.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dry little dollops that I've dried
evenly and kept cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that there's a window where you
ruin the hash if you're grading too late.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the majority of people that
have tried to dry in the past throughout
[SPEAKER_07]: history have used the microphone.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can work on your microphones coming
in.
[SPEAKER_21]: People say they can't hear you,
but that kind of reminded me of
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldilocks.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing things on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_21]: What kind of obstacles are you bumping
into turning all that?
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing bubble hashing the rosin?
[SPEAKER_25]: I would say the freeze dryer is the most
important thing for getting everything the
[SPEAKER_25]: same every time.
[SPEAKER_25]: In a lab setting, you want to be able to
control everything you can.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can replicate the same thing over
and over with the same strains.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think the freeze dryer is never one
in that process.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you could be pumping out hash.
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's ideal for us.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm more of a large scale.
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's all about just having a
system where everything is running
[SPEAKER_25]: consistently through.
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not ever storing anything until
it's either in hash form or it's being
[SPEAKER_25]: pressed directly in the rosin and then
being cured from that point.
[SPEAKER_25]: I know a lot of people have used the heat
mats in the past with the jams and the
[SPEAKER_25]: other things.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's always been with experimentation,
but I've always wanted to get it as exact
[SPEAKER_25]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have incubators actually that we use
for all the jars when we're going to do
[SPEAKER_25]: curing like that.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we can have it fine-tuned to the exact
temperature for an exact amount of time.
[SPEAKER_25]: I find that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_25]: On a large scale, it's all about being
able to do the same thing over and over
and over.
[SPEAKER_21]: What kind of numbers are you rocking?
[SPEAKER_21]: You're using a Whistler Tech W300WT,
right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll run like about 40 pounds,
like a wash about, and then that'll
[SPEAKER_25]: process through.
[SPEAKER_25]: And on a given day, I mean, we're
processing about 300 pounds of rosin on a
[SPEAKER_25]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_25]: It depends on.
[SPEAKER_25]: Rosin?
[SPEAKER_25]: No, not a rosin.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're processing like three to 800 pounds.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, we'll press out like five,
six pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's still a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_26]: What kind of meals are you getting out of
that?
[SPEAKER_25]: We got two Sasquatch M1s that we use.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's like, I try to have everything as
dialed as possible.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll rock multiple machines at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know that I would call them in
moisture content, because with the freeze
[SPEAKER_25]: dryer, you're getting all that moisture
out.
[SPEAKER_25]: I think a lot of the curing process is
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wrong information.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's talking hash, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, even with the hash.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think moisture is extremely important
to talk about with flour, pressing flour
[SPEAKER_25]: all day, all day.
[SPEAKER_25]: Because when it comes to hash,
I mean, we're getting all the moisture
[SPEAKER_25]: out, for the most part, in the hash.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's all basically the same.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think whoever was saying something
about limonene or whatever, different
[SPEAKER_25]: terpenes have different volatilities.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the point is get all the moisture
out of your hash before you press it.
[SPEAKER_26]: I will say a lot of people are producing
wet hash still with a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_26]: It all depends on how you're rocking your
freeze dryer and what temperature you're
[SPEAKER_26]: using and things like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: You're obviously producing that much
constantly.
[SPEAKER_26]: Know how to get your hash to what you need
to get it.
[SPEAKER_26]: But unfortunately, there's lots of people
who are misinformed with the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_26]: even and are trying to dry at much too low
temperatures and not achieving triple
[SPEAKER_26]: points.
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_25]: Any time you buy any equipment,
the equipment is not going to save you in
[SPEAKER_25]: any terms of making anything ever.
[SPEAKER_25]: You still have to know how to run the
equipment and to do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll always say that.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll say, yeah, moisture content.
[SPEAKER_26]: Moisture content is definitely 100% the
number one variable.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think we've all been taught that
since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_26]: Once again, I learned from watching bubble
man videos and I used to grate everything
[SPEAKER_26]: and I was from the microplane.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we were always competing with fresh
frozen trying to get that dry with a
[SPEAKER_26]: microplane.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm talking more of a post press.
[SPEAKER_25]: Post press is about moisture content at
that point.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm saying post press production.
[SPEAKER_25]: When you're talking about your different
texts and your different curing and your
[SPEAKER_25]: oxidation, I don't think moisture content
is coming into it as much unless you're
[SPEAKER_25]: introducing the fridge and storing it
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's more sort of terpenes and
then the volatility of different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just throw in something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a headphone issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everybody can hear me this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make it real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say from a person's
perspective that can't afford a freeze
[SPEAKER_07]: dryer.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just growing six plants legally in
California, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the legal limit on your plant
count.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, you're doing a really small
batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is possible to get dry hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say if you keep that room
cold and you dollop out the hash really
[SPEAKER_07]: nice and evenly and that you're drying
those dollops cold and then you take out
[SPEAKER_07]: each dollop one by one and you dry that
with a microplane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of using the microplane as an
emergency tool like most people did,
[SPEAKER_07]: they try to see first or do whatever,
but it's like no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if it's fresh frozen,
you're going to just have a hell of a time
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're wasting a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, I don't want to dry it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care if I'm shredding heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, you're so small scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's dry that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get it dry in 10 to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: I scrape it right up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in a jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: The layman at home that is watching this,
you can dry hash without a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is awesome to buy a freeze dryer,
especially if you're making hash on a
[SPEAKER_07]: large scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like I was saying, I max out at 250.
[SPEAKER_07]: My wrists start hurting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the 40 micron and I'm like,
I want to throw this in the trash,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I don't throw it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I wanted to say, guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's think about the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone did have a question.
[SPEAKER_21]: They said, does anyone want to drop some
knowledge on the freeze dryer?
[SPEAKER_21]: Does anyone have any settings they want to
share or any tricks and tips they've
[SPEAKER_21]: learned with the freeze dryer?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what someone's specifically asking
for in chat.
[SPEAKER_21]: If anyone wants to share, you're up.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that you really got to be
sure of, the main thing, is that everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: knows the shelf limit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to drop that to 30 degrees or else
you're going to cook your hash,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I'm sure maybe every one of us has
unfortunately done, and I did,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to drop that shelf limit to 30 and
you got to save the setting, which is a
[SPEAKER_08]: pain in the ass, but call the customer
service.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_22]: My settings are shelf.
[SPEAKER_22]: Shelf limit is actually at 40 on mine.
[SPEAKER_22]: I usually do a, but it's interesting to
hear different people's because I love to
[SPEAKER_22]: hear this from, especially from this
panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think mine's at 35, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got 60?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, 60.
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_23]: 50.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_23]: Shelf limit 50.
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, the unit has issues if you set
it lower than that, my unit specifically.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's an earlier one and I feel like it
throws this error where it can't protect
[SPEAKER_23]: the temperature.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think for those of us that have freeze
dryers, let's go through that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go through what we have for a freeze
dryer and what those couple little
[SPEAKER_22]: settings are.
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, to add to that, what vacs are people
using?
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have an oil vac, small pharmaceutical
freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_22]: My shelf limit is set to 40.
[SPEAKER_22]: My freeze time is, for the most part,
generally just straight nine hours.
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have the ability to drop that a
little bit, but that's a whole other
[SPEAKER_22]: story.
[SPEAKER_22]: The central dry portion of the freeze
dryer is automatic.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't change that.
[SPEAKER_22]: My final dry is generally 14 hours done
and done.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's my settings.
[SPEAKER_14]: I run a medium pharmaceutical,
two of them, so seven trays in each one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Set them to 30 degrees each.
[SPEAKER_14]: It all depends on tray thickness too,
on how fast those trays are going to dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do a lot of processing, so you lay
thicker trays.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes those do need to dry for a
little bit longer than some of the smaller
[SPEAKER_14]: trays that only have 100 grams on them or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to run them at 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_14]: I pre-freeze the slabs so I don't do the
free setting really.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do get the freeze dryers cold,
so they're nice and frozen inside,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I don't freeze the trays in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I freeze them in a chest freezer or in a
big stand up freezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I was saying that's a whole
other story.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you can slide them into the freezer
when they're ready and do the drying
[SPEAKER_14]: process then.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got experience running the oilless
pumps and the oil pumps with the Harvest
[SPEAKER_14]: Right units.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, dry times can vary.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anywhere between from 12 to 18 hours,
depending on the thickness of the tray
[SPEAKER_14]: itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what's the main difference between
the pharmaceutical and the regular tray?
[SPEAKER_14]: The big difference I found too,
though, was I was working in a facility
[SPEAKER_14]: where the power would go out every now and
then.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were using a whole unit there.
[SPEAKER_14]: The power went out.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I came back the next day,
it was concrete.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the hash was concrete.
[SPEAKER_14]: The unit will resort back to the hottest
settings when it turns back on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the shelf is like 125 degrees.
[SPEAKER_23]: You can actually set that setting so that
that doesn't happen because the same exact
[SPEAKER_23]: thing happened to me.
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have the old unit, you can
definitely set that limit down.
[SPEAKER_23]: Just call up tech support and they'll walk
you through putting it to that.
[SPEAKER_23]: So when the power fails and it comes back
on, it's not going to go to 125.
[SPEAKER_25]: I've seen some weird stuff with some of
the pharmaceutical units, but you can also
[SPEAKER_25]: buy tray conversion kits for smaller,
if you need more tray space or something
[SPEAKER_25]: and you already have a smaller medium,
you can get conversion kits that will add
[SPEAKER_25]: you extra trays.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can actually get a seven tray kit.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can shrink those trays and have
double the trays in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Call Harvest Right and they'll set you up
with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done that before myself.
[SPEAKER_22]: I visited the Harvest Right headquarters
when I was having problems with mine.
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of a little bit of a horror story,
but I put my freeze dryer in my car and
[SPEAKER_22]: drove to their headquarters, pulled up in
the back.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my unit.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a little bit of a nightmare,
but in the process we formed a little bit
[SPEAKER_22]: of a relationship and I actually got to
ask a bunch of questions and supposedly,
[SPEAKER_22]: and I'm not, I don't know much about the
freeze dryers, but besides just the
[SPEAKER_22]: different shelving units that they have
stock, the pharmaceutical or the other
[SPEAKER_22]: pharmaceutical one will come with the
shelf limit set at 40 standard.
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, you can change your
permanent settings from your current
[SPEAKER_22]: settings.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if you guys know that there's
buttons.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's miscellaneous buttons in upper
right hand corners.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, little secret buttons you can press.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm showing you those things right now.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what was I getting at?
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, supposedly there's higher grade
instrumentation devices in the
[SPEAKER_22]: pharmaceutical units, whatever the hell
that means.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say is
that there's better software in the
[SPEAKER_26]: pharmaceutical versions.
[SPEAKER_26]: And just to touch on freeze dryers real
quick too, there's another company,
[SPEAKER_26]: well there's multiple companies right now
working on multiple different freeze
[SPEAKER_26]: dryers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been working on this one by a company
called lab conco and it has like say,
[SPEAKER_26]: uh, you know, with the harvest,
right?
[SPEAKER_26]: Mostly, especially with the home edition,
you can't like you set up one variable
[SPEAKER_26]: temperature for your, for your shelves.
[SPEAKER_26]: This one, you can change it by the minute
by 30 seconds by whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_26]: You can ramp it up and down.
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you change individual shelves?
[SPEAKER_26]: There's also probes that you can freeze
inside of your patties.
[SPEAKER_26]: So you have like a little probe that comes
out, right?
[SPEAKER_26]: That you put your patty right on top of it
and you freeze it like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then you throw those into your freeze
dryer and it'll actually tell you the
[SPEAKER_26]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_26]: And actually, you know, it tells you a
bunch of different variables.
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_26]: It comes with an Edwards pump as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, they just hit MJ biz this last,
uh, this last one.
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the only problem that I've seen
with it so far is that say with the
[SPEAKER_26]: harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_26]: It gets freezing cold, you know,
within, you know, say like negative 30 to
[SPEAKER_26]: negative 70 on some of the units I've
seen, uh, Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_26]: This one has a huge oil in it,
but it doesn't get the environment that
[SPEAKER_26]: cold.
[SPEAKER_26]: So getting your, getting your shelf
temperature below 40, 45 or whatever your
[SPEAKER_26]: ambient temperature is, it's really hard
to do.
[SPEAKER_26]: So what I was getting at is that freeze
drying technology has been around
[SPEAKER_26]: obviously longer than we've been drying
hash with it.
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, there's tons of different types that
you can check out and like do lots of
[SPEAKER_26]: different things.
[SPEAKER_26]: I think where the harvest right is better
is like what I brought up it keeps the
[SPEAKER_26]: environment like freezer cold or colder
and preserves your terpenes and they don't
[SPEAKER_26]: change your cure or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can get that beach sand
consistency, you know?
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, but as far as like variable
temperatures, I think telling everybody
[SPEAKER_26]: that 30 or 40 degrees is the way to do it
is kind of a farce to be honest,
[SPEAKER_26]: cause you can get your hash done obviously
at any different temperature.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just what you think is the best
marketable way to put out your hash.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, that's all I want to get out is
like, well, you could cook it at 90
[SPEAKER_26]: degrees and get it into a grease.
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're just going to press it into
rosin anyways, it won't necessarily affect
[SPEAKER_26]: your color too much.
[SPEAKER_26]: If it's fresh frozen and things like that,
you know, it's just how long and how far
[SPEAKER_26]: you want to take to, like for me,
it takes about 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_26]: I do depending on once again, if it's
summer, if it's summer and I live in
[SPEAKER_26]: Colorado, there's not a lot of moisture,
ambient moisture outside or anything like
[SPEAKER_26]: that.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd like to keep it a little lag more
stable.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll try.
[SPEAKER_26]: I dry my hash at 60 plus degrees in the
harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_26]: Just because so when it comes out,
it's more stable like, you know,
[SPEAKER_26]: but in the, in the winter when there's
it's cold out in Colorado right now,
[SPEAKER_26]: it's snowing still.
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, but you can get away with drying a
hash a lot colder and it's staying stable
[SPEAKER_26]: for longer because of the ambient moisture
and everything around you temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't feel like that's pulling more
turps the hotter you dry it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I mean, we know that it pulls turps
freeze dryers do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.
[SPEAKER_26]: So correct.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all variable of what you think is
best and what you want to give to your
[SPEAKER_26]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_26]: So for me, once again, I want the most
stable resin with no moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then to press that and refine it from
there.
[SPEAKER_26]: And even so say refining your,
your rosin from cold here to any type of
[SPEAKER_26]: oven tech or mechanical separation like
Rackins does all those terpenes are going
[SPEAKER_26]: to change, you know, um, a friend,
all those different processes.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know that because I do testing.
[SPEAKER_26]: I should probably post more of it,
but you, you can see a terpene difference
[SPEAKER_26]: and all different types of terpenes from a
cold cure from the same strain to a oven
[SPEAKER_26]: tech to the whole now and everything.
[SPEAKER_26]: So once again, I think it's all good.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like as long as it's a stable product and
you have a great, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_26]: knowledge behind it and you're putting out
something good for your end consumer
[SPEAKER_26]: patient.
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_22]: You definitely freaking should put some
posts more of that testing.
[SPEAKER_22]: I know people are just would just jump all
over the testing.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're really looking at it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Cause it's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_26]: People think with the oven tech that
you're burning off all your terpenes know
[SPEAKER_26]: that they're changing.
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't, you are burning off some of them
for sure.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like bubble man has talked about it before
with like your terpenes changing.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_22]: Your 20 hour freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, kind of impressed me.
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course you said you're up in 50.
[SPEAKER_22]: You said your shelf dump was it all
depends.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, so that's about my average.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I like to keep it 40 or below,
but it all depends.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like how often you change out your
oil as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or if you have an oil list, my cycle
almost every time is 30 hours,
[SPEAKER_22]: 30 to 32 hours.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: I like to like, when I leave for the day,
I come back the next day around like noon,
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, or something.
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there anybody else in here?
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you say that the, the, the water
content, the amount of water that's in
[SPEAKER_17]: your hash and in those trays is the same
every time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And is that giving you your steady
consistent 30 hours or?
[SPEAKER_22]: I think my final dry is what's really
giving me my, my consistent 30 hours,
[SPEAKER_22]: my, my consistent nine hour freeze usually
just to make sure shit is frozen.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the consistent 14 hour freeze at
the end or the dry at the end is important
[SPEAKER_22]: to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've just pulled some hash out before.
[SPEAKER_22]: Like that, like I said, I've pulled some
hash out.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's got a little bit of the moisture on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the pucks are still a little bit
frozen together.
[SPEAKER_22]: It got a little moisture content in them
and I don't ever want that to happen
[SPEAKER_22]: again.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, and I like, I like a very high terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I leave my shelf room at 40.
[SPEAKER_22]: I run it for a full 30 hours, you know,
but is there any, anybody else on the
[SPEAKER_22]: panel here that has a freezer that wants
to go to what their settings are and
[SPEAKER_22]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause I'd like to hear that if they do.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a, I have a freeze dryer in our
labs.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have three of them that we're using.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all scientific harvest rights,
but I've modified one with a laboid pump
[SPEAKER_16]: to get more precise and quicker reaction
times out of the cycles.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's, it's really worked out.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I suggest, you know, there's a lot of
modifications you can do to these things.
[SPEAKER_16]: Harvest rights pumps are not the best
pumps in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're really slow.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, I didn't, I don't want to not
try anybody, but the laboid is more like
[SPEAKER_16]: a, you know, bringing a machine gun to a
knife fight.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a, I would say look into that
company.
[SPEAKER_16]: For all you guys out there, you know,
the harvest rate means really well,
[SPEAKER_16]: but it just falls into black in terms of
like the quality of the pump and how
[SPEAKER_16]: quickly it turns them on its cycling
times.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I'm doing 72 hour drive
times personally guys, cause I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_16]: preserve every stitch of those terpenes
and I'm doing, I actually can't talk about
[SPEAKER_16]: how the each setting is made, but what I
can say is that they're long run times and
[SPEAKER_16]: it's, it's really cold.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that's some of y'all,
if we can take it offline, I'll,
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll get deep onto that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's, but I can say it's like,
you know, it's below 30.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's never going above 60.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, it's, it's, it's long,
it's long run times.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think spirit admitted, but that a lot
to the long dry times that are really,
[SPEAKER_14]: really cold to open the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes the results are exactly the
same as writing the freeze dryer at my
[SPEAKER_14]: normal settings.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all straight independent.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, trade dependent,
how thick those trays are really has a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: to do with how quick that is going to dry
as well.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're essentially flattening the
curve.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're essentially fat flattening the
curve, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: In a sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: The process of the sublimation process,
you're flattening that curve and the
[SPEAKER_17]: product that time that it takes to finish
that process.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's, that's the, that's the ideology
behind it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and you know, you can all take that
base knowledge and go headfirst into that
[SPEAKER_16]: with, with those dry times.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it's, it's real helpful to know that
you can go that long and get that quality
[SPEAKER_16]: back.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's, it's kind of like,
wait, am I waiting too long?
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, like we just mentioned,
you know, it's from damn about it,
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby, it's, it's all straight dependent.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything is, you know, it's,
I don't, it's, you know, like we were
[SPEAKER_16]: talking about delimiting before,
you know, it's why I don't press a lot of
[SPEAKER_16]: Jack Herrera anymore.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just too soupy.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't really do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awesome for me, for my head,
but, but in terms of a, a scalable
[SPEAKER_16]: cultivar, it's, it's a tough one to work
with in terms of what we're doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I use a medium pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dry in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pre, I pre dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use the free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I use the freeze dryer to freeze
in if it's open, but most of the time I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just have the, the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some hardware you can get
for the freezer by cool, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you can modify like an
upright freezer and it just creates all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of slots for you to throw your trays
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a cycle of trays ready to
just rock in the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you're not running life on your
freeze dryers, you know, using it as like
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, a flash freezer rather than
letting it focus on just straight drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you're just going to get
more life and use out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I dry anywhere from 35 to 45
usually depend on the thickness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thickness of the hash, the strains that
I'm running, depending on like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what it is, if it's like a full
spec, like a second, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a second spin full spec, or if it's like
just some straight 90 full trays of just
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 and like one machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really like there's so many variables
to like dry time and, and temp and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, you know, especially dry time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I'll still, and,
and I'll check it throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I let it do its whole dry
cycle, but once it gets up into the final
[SPEAKER_02]: dry, you know, I'll, I'll pop it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll flip the bottom,
see how it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if there's no ice, because usually
the ice sublimates to the top and you'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll, you'll, you'll have like the ice
patties towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really check once the ice is
gone and not everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't really want to, you know,
fuck with it too much, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check throughout and then basically
give it a little bit more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I see that it's like, it looks fully
dry to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a little bit more dry time
and that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once I break it out,
you know, I feel like once, once you pull
[SPEAKER_02]: them out the freeze dryer, you definitely
want to, want to get that, that parchment
[SPEAKER_02]: paper with the hash off the trays quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, you got a super cold metal
that's going to condensate quickly in that
[SPEAKER_02]: ambient temperature and that, or in that
whatever room you're pulling it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, obviously if you're pulling
it out in your cold room, it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be fine, but you know,
just to reduce condensation and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, get it off that freeze dry
tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, that's,
that's, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a really good point to mention is to
take the, the sheets off the freeze dry
[SPEAKER_14]: tray because they will develop moisture
quicker than you think.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that parchment will suck up the
moisture pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you are in a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's best to transfer it onto some
clean parchment if you can pretty quickly
[SPEAKER_14]: or put it in the jar, like you were
saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that paper acts as a desiccant,
you know, it starts to absorb it and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just going to transfer into your
super dry hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you spend all that time growing the
material, drying it, washing it and stuff,
[SPEAKER_14]: just to have a product that you're not
happy with.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, that's really upsetting when
you're, when you're working this hard to
[SPEAKER_14]: create these kinds of products,
because it's a lot harder than it is to do
[SPEAKER_14]: the hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's put a lot more love and
care into these things.
[SPEAKER_22]: I take my tray straight from the freeze
dryer right back to the chest freezer
[SPEAKER_22]: again, until I'm ready to press the hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're keeping that tray cold either way,
but you know, once you're getting it off
[SPEAKER_02]: that tray, you know, once you're taking
that tray out and you're, you're ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with that hash, you want to get it
off that tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just no condensation anywhere,
you know, get that tray back wherever it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to go, throw it back in the freezer,
keep them cold, wipe it down, whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: got to do with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, is anyone using a, like a,
like a sieve to run their, their freeze
[SPEAKER_16]: dried hash through to break it up,
put it, put it back to like a powder and
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, what's your favorite tech to do
that every time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing it personally,
but I just was curious to see if anybody
[SPEAKER_16]: else has been doing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's going to be released.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good, a good method
anyways, because you know, that way
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're, you're basically breaking
up all the clumps just that, even if there
[SPEAKER_02]: was that minute amount of moisture in it,
just, just allowing it to expose to that
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's just going to kind of
like let that evaporate quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's not, there's, if there's any
moisture at all, and it allows you to see
[SPEAKER_02]: every bit of the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is any like little icicles,
crystals somewhere on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause you felt like you dried long enough,
but you just did a 400 gram fucking run in
[SPEAKER_02]: a medium freeze dryer or, or you,
or you maxed out the trays, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you're really like running some new
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's the most you pushed or you're,
you're doing a different size run.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you still running it through
that sieve is going to let you see if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's anything like ice crystals and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen some people, I have seen some
people use a, just two butter knives and
[SPEAKER_08]: just chopped up like with chopsticks,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just me, me, me.
[SPEAKER_22]: Easier to put in the bags when it's either
sifted or broke up into smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're really sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just like dumping flour through it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could put it in a jar and shake it as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: But like you were saying, it seems like
the last line of defense in case there is
[SPEAKER_11]: a little ice chunk or, you know,
a little piece of contaminant that seems
[SPEAKER_11]: like your last line of defense.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good, good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see it really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to almost see like every bit
of it in a, in a, in a, like I use a
[SPEAKER_02]: really wide sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't use like the traditional
bowed sieve at the bottom, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like how it's just like a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I use a flat, big old 16 inch
sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll dump it in there over a big ass
sheet of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I'll just, I'll,
I'll run my hand through it and shake it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll lightly press on it with
the glove and then it kind of smashes
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in, shake it up and let
everything fall right through.
[SPEAKER_17]: But some people might not know either is
that if you're sieving and you have ice
[SPEAKER_17]: chunks that pop up, you can actually toss
those back on your tray with parchment
[SPEAKER_17]: back in the machine and add more dry time
and finish those chunks off.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had to do that before for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like if that happens,
it's like, oh shit, there's gotta be
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture in the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you don't see the moisture in
the hash, there's an ice chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gotta be moisture in that hash and
all that hash needs to be dried.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've definitely done that where I've
sieved it and found a little ice chunk and
[SPEAKER_14]: got really paranoid and put in the hash,
all of it right back in the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_14]: on some trays, you know, until the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it then sieved it again to make sure
that there was no more chunks of ice in
[SPEAKER_14]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in that, in that sense,
you could also just fucking sieve it up
[SPEAKER_02]: real like fine on a big ass sheet of
parchment, throw it on like the bun racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just line it up for a couple of hours,
you know, it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say from Reverse's
perspective, it's never free-dried.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was confused like, well, I see something
that I thought, you know, I thought it was
[SPEAKER_07]: dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's doing it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the samples that I saw were
overdried and I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_15]: point out that, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab the headphones, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, this isn't exactly for, I'll be
honest.
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't exactly this particular show.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hash Church right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's very few layman's watching Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of the headiest of the heady.
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is a special show on techniques
going into rosin that people have acquired
[SPEAKER_21]: and achieved in the course of the last
however many years.
[SPEAKER_21]: Five plus years.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's what this conversation is
leading us to right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say people are doing that
sieve tech because it's a smart way of not
[SPEAKER_07]: over drying your hash, but also making
sure that it's dry enough to product out,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to.
Grandma.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I had a question, guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to ask to further what I was
saying with the reason I brought up the
[SPEAKER_16]: sieve is what microns does everyone make?
[SPEAKER_16]: Mixing together, you know, I'm personally
only doing 120 and 73 right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then 45, 25 and then 90 is just,
you know, that goes to jars.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm curious to see what everyone
else's thoughts are and what microns you
[SPEAKER_16]: guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the 120, 90 depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the 150, sometimes the 70,
never the 40, never the 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: 180 is rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the strain, depends on,
you know, like the method and stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, who smokes 40?
[SPEAKER_14]: Carol fucking Baskin.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, she does.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you guys agree with interrupt.
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are going to think that I'm
fucking Carol Baskin's then because almost
[SPEAKER_22]: every single time that I wash,
I will use the 220.
[SPEAKER_22]: The 160 drop to the 45 and then the 25.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll always press my 45.
[SPEAKER_14]: If the materials fire, you know,
sometimes that full range of microns can
[SPEAKER_14]: be really, really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, you can't deny that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Every time you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking to my homie about that
yesterday, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some strains that are just gold
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might not be gold as far as like
the way it's yielding and, and it might
[SPEAKER_02]: not be like the melt that you want to put
out, but as far as when it, when you press
[SPEAKER_02]: it into rosin, the terpenes that are
present and, and just the way the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the color, when it hits the nail,
you know, it doesn't darken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, it's still fire,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen, I've seen 25 do that,
even though that 25, like it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a totally different texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I'll judge a lot of these too
is like, you'll notice like when,
[SPEAKER_02]: if anybody like still will tap the coal
shit, cause I'll still like tap coal,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it in the jar when I'm going to try
to manipulate for some type of consistency
[SPEAKER_02]: or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the way the 40 looks,
like the creaminess of it compared to like
[SPEAKER_02]: how fire, like a 90, 70, a 120,
the 40 looks more matte and more fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: my boy called it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like Cran wax.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, it looks really soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that great, but in some strains,
even though it's like that, the turts that
[SPEAKER_02]: are there and the shit like that,
it's, it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_22]: To me, when I tell people, you know,
if you, and this is where I kind of was
[SPEAKER_22]: talking a little bit earlier and I think
it got a little misconstrued, but when I
[SPEAKER_22]: say I grow for rosin, I'm growing resin
for rosin, but I'm growing for the end
[SPEAKER_22]: game is rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: My end game isn't hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't keep very much hash to smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just not what I do.
[SPEAKER_22]: If I was keeping hash for smoke,
I would most certainly throw in the 120
[SPEAKER_22]: and the 90 and the 73 to find out which
one was the most preferred smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm not in it for that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in it for the rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: I drop it all to the 45.
[SPEAKER_22]: Now here's the other kicker.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will press the 25.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will press the 160.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mix those together.
[SPEAKER_22]: And on my, on my page, I jokingly call
that my food grade hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: And most people are like, holy,
that's really food grade hash,
[SPEAKER_22]: Pedro.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it is, it really is.
[SPEAKER_22]: It just doesn't have, for the most part,
the THCA content.
[SPEAKER_22]: The terpenes aren't there.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's darker.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do for the most part, decarb it and
eat it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do a lot of the same stuff over at
Burnside Garden Collective.
[SPEAKER_14]: We like to package and sell anywhere from
149 down to 90U.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, take the 150 and the 70 and
blend those two together for, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: a product that's not as expensive as the
first pull 149 through 90.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like everyone else is saying,
certain strains are going to put out some
[SPEAKER_14]: really fire micron ranges.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like sometimes the 89 through the 40 can
be really fire if you're leaving that
[SPEAKER_14]: together.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you separate out the 40, you can use
that for edibles or, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's lots of different things you can
do with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And certain strains like lemon peel,
you can catch 219 down to 90U.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you wouldn't even know it,
you know, it tastes just like the 90 and
[SPEAKER_14]: the 140.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, it tastes all the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: So certain strains do carry that terpene
content throughout the resin all the way
[SPEAKER_14]: through.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is, it is fun to see which strains
put out, you know, heaviest in what
[SPEAKER_14]: microns.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I've seen at our farm,
a lot of the stuff dumps real hard and 179
[SPEAKER_14]: down to 90.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the 70U and the 40U and the 180 is
pretty much non-existent, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even on 8, 9,000 grams of material being
washed, you'll only pull, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: 5, 10 grams of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the majority of the resin sits in,
you know, the 150, the 120, the 90,
[SPEAKER_14]: all in the microns that we consider to be
the best that we enjoy smoking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's yeah, that's like myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you find those varieties,
you just want to hang on to them forever.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's why I've had like four
mainstays in my library for pretty much
[SPEAKER_16]: two decades at this point.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I inch out and I try new things
for a while and then I'll start new stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's, it's hard to break away from
those ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do really well in the garden,
in the wash, on the plates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it takes a lot of work to find those
for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to feed them big time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you have to give them to other,
other growers and have, expect them to
[SPEAKER_16]: grow them the same way.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's also really tough.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's, you're, you're so true.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, I've found that it's overall
plant health.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's how you get, you know, the plant,
you got to keep the plant health really
[SPEAKER_14]: high because the resin is going to derives
from the plant health.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how you get it there, you just want to
make, keep the plant health as,
[SPEAKER_14]: as high as possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you go to process that and turn it
into hash or full melt, or if you're going
[SPEAKER_14]: to press it into rosin, but you can
achieve the highest quality the whole
[SPEAKER_14]: time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to handle everything correctly
from the flower when you're harvesting it
[SPEAKER_14]: to when you're washing the material to how
long you're washing it, the environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: How you're drying it, you know,
there's, there's humongous amounts of
[SPEAKER_14]: variables and small things that go into
doing all those that everyone does
[SPEAKER_14]: differently.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we're all achieving very
similar, but very different resins,
[SPEAKER_14]: even from the same strains, because
everyone's room, their environment,
[SPEAKER_14]: their techniques, they're all different.
[SPEAKER_14]: So being able to share those things with
everyone on a large scale is pretty cool
[SPEAKER_14]: because, you know, everyone can get a
little bit better at what they're doing
[SPEAKER_14]: and, and develop a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_28]: Pedro, we grow strictly for rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're, yeah, we're pretty much probably
the only ones here in the oddballs out.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we grow strictly for rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: We grow outdoor, sun grown,
non-greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_19]: We dry cure 90, 95% of our harvest to,
you know, almost bone dry and then bin
[SPEAKER_19]: cure it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we actually do primarily all
blends and we'll blend first through third
[SPEAKER_19]: wash together, generally for most cases.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we individually, we collect all,
I'll use the bags, check each one,
[SPEAKER_19]: but then, you know, we're doing a 45 to a
159 primarily.
[SPEAKER_28]: Depending on the actual strains and we'll
mix them back together so that where
[SPEAKER_28]: you're getting different strains and
different views all together.
[SPEAKER_28]: So you're getting a very nice variety of
everything at once.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's creating a nice, even experience
for our clients and for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's kind of what we're going for
is, you know, we want that nice full
[SPEAKER_19]: experience.
[SPEAKER_28]: Right now we've got like 36 different
ones.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we kind of cherry pick what we want to
mix together and see what works.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're doing, I think, 20 new ones this
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have certain types that you go back to
that you find because you're sun grown
[SPEAKER_09]: here in Maine and not with cover over.
[SPEAKER_09]: You obviously must have some that are
successful.
[SPEAKER_19]: We stay away from long running sativa
since we're doing sun grown, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: which is the downside, but you know,
that's one of the only things.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other big thing that we stay away
from is just things that will promote bug
[SPEAKER_19]: rot and, you know, two things that grow
too giant size of nubs that, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: will promote low humidity, low temperature
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're fighting that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you obviously going for like,
are you going for turp forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause like part of the conversation in the
back to Bobby was talking about the
[SPEAKER_09]: quality of the cultivar and the
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you're sun grown, no cover,
not indoors, you're exposed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you guys finding that you're following
a certain pathway for not just the
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivar in terms of production for a
resin, but more for the terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_19]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going for a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not necessarily of the fan of like,
you know, I want every terpene off the
[SPEAKER_19]: plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I'm in the saltless mine camp,
but there's a bunch of volatile terpenes
[SPEAKER_19]: and the cannabis and the hash and the
flour and the rosin that, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: some of these things we're going to find
out down the road may or may not cause
[SPEAKER_19]: problems to us because terpenes by
themselves are not necessarily meant for
[SPEAKER_19]: us.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we're a fan of a nice high
end THC content.
[SPEAKER_19]: We want some CBDs in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, you know, we want to blend of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want just one or two terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I want to see, you know,
three, four terpenes, seven terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll blend two or three different
strains together to make our rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're getting a nice complex profile
that we were, that we're going for
[SPEAKER_19]: because, you know, it's all about that
experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we want something that's
uplifting and then, you know, it's going
[SPEAKER_19]: to carry it for a nice little while.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know, we're not like concerned
about the genetics because the environment
[SPEAKER_19]: is our big thing that we're fighting here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, if with an outdoor,
with an indoor grow becomes a way
[SPEAKER_19]: different beast because, like,
you're creating a similar environment in
[SPEAKER_19]: the same place.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're talking about growing
plants, you know, growing here versus
[SPEAKER_19]: Colorado will never produce the same plant
because geographically GPS, we're at a
[SPEAKER_19]: different elevation, a different moisture
content, and literally a different place
[SPEAKER_19]: on the globe.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the environment that the plant is
exposed to here will be different.
[SPEAKER_19]: And those stressors and those factors will
create different terp profiles every year
[SPEAKER_19]: that some people will miss out on because
they're not, you know, battling those
[SPEAKER_19]: elements at the same time.
[SPEAKER_28]: Like we'll get different colors and
deeper, darker.
[SPEAKER_21]: It gets into the terroir and you see
lavender, for instance, produces
[SPEAKER_21]: incredibly in this one region.
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe it's in France and maybe Germany
has the second one, but it just seems to
[SPEAKER_21]: create a terpene profile based on that
terroir that is unique and special and
[SPEAKER_21]: recognized by the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_21]: And cannabis will be no different.
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll be very interesting to find what
cultivars shine where under which
[SPEAKER_21]: conditions, you know, how it's being
grown.
[SPEAKER_21]: All of these different things are,
you know, what give us the outcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's similar to growing wine or
tobacco and a lot of that sense is in,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, agriculture because that's what
it all starts at is the farming.
[SPEAKER_19]: So whatever creates that is going to start
driving some different things up in
[SPEAKER_19]: regions, especially if you're talking
about outdoor and greenhouse primarily,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, at some point, hopefully we'll
start getting data because you're
[SPEAKER_19]: collecting it as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: As a couple of other people, you know,
we'll know different cultivars do better
[SPEAKER_19]: in certain regions and exposed to
different environments.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas the indoor guys can kind of run
whatever they want, but the outdoor and
[SPEAKER_19]: the greenhouse guys can start getting some
unique things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once we get some more of this data log to
understand what grows in the regions.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out Cushkirk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out Cushkirk down in Southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a big breeder and he does everything
in hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, he does a lot of stuff in the
open fields.
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't cover them up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of the resin that he produces
from that farm is so unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the most flavorful resin you'll
ever try in your life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not only that, it's some of the
meltiest resin I've ever seen personally.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's a good example of someone doing a
really good job of using, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: the natural elements to grow very high
quality resin that's not lacking in
[SPEAKER_14]: quality.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's all about finding the best genetics,
the best plants that are going to work in
[SPEAKER_14]: his environment that he can breed to
create really superior hashtrays to share
[SPEAKER_14]: with everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say on the East coast,
just to kind of dovetail off what they
[SPEAKER_16]: were talking about, you know, cause we're,
I spent my majority of my time bouncing
[SPEAKER_16]: between the two coasts, but I'm very much
from the East coast and grown a lot here.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've such a different environment and the
same cultivars that are grown in Southern
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregon or even Northern Cali and areas
like that just don't respond the same way
[SPEAKER_16]: as they do out here.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have blue or light,
so our cannabinoid profile is going to be
[SPEAKER_16]: different.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our terpene profiles are much different.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the light spectrum is much different
out here and those plants grow totally,
[SPEAKER_16]: not totally differently, but they express
traits in a very different manner.
[SPEAKER_16]: And finding the ones that really truly
work through the whole season,
[SPEAKER_16]: all the way to like a really cold,
you know, end of the October at,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, into November is really a tall
order, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really hard for us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys can't, you're so far North that
you can't even hit October 30th.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a foot of snow outside,
so we can't even go out until like May.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we had our first frost,
I want to say, September 28th last year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Colin, I have grown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plants on both coasts that I bred on both
coasts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I could name a couple types like the
strawberry angel food that I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was bred in Southern Humboldt,
actually 15 miles on the East side of
[SPEAKER_09]: Southern Humboldt near Garberville.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also repeated that type out here
where the seeds were bred out there and
[SPEAKER_09]: then launched out here, propagated three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's one of the shiniest, beautiful,
healthy, vigorous types.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's resistant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It did like it made a pathway.
[SPEAKER_09]: From where it was good out there to here
as a really sativa poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have several types that have done
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually, I think a lot of it's the
like, um, where Cush Kirk is open field
[SPEAKER_09]: pollination or sungrown breeding primarily
or only it's that I believe that with
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding, it's the, it's taking on a lot
of the elements and it's also resisting
[SPEAKER_09]: naturally where like skunk man Sam brought
up even last week, how those types will
[SPEAKER_09]: show you, but they're far and few between
and instead of where we're following the
[SPEAKER_09]: name and the Terp so much, I know a lot of
indoor breeding and a lot of indoor focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually not the plant speaking truly
in its natural setting and then breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: through those into the next generation,
which can naturally resist those elements
[SPEAKER_09]: and then still be health, vigorous,
resin producing, and then turf profile on
[SPEAKER_09]: top of it is the new kicker.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a lot of boxes to check,
but that's why those special types are
[SPEAKER_09]: special.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the, the, the acclimation aspect too
of the plants themselves and some
[SPEAKER_16]: varieties are going to acclimate much
quicker than others as well, which is a
[SPEAKER_16]: whole variable on itself, you know,
that's, you know, so that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what do you, so I was going to say,
um, Rackham's brought up, uh, bag types
[SPEAKER_16]: and what everyone's kind of, kind of
leaning towards in terms of pressing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anyone that's, uh, wants to share
any, any info on, on things that they're
[SPEAKER_16]: using in terms of parchments or,
uh, or bags?
[SPEAKER_14]: I get all my screens through the hash
depot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good friend of mine out here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, he makes rosin screens in many
different sizes, custom sizes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he's a, he's a good friend,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's, you know, it's, he's a good dude to
support in his screens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gets them to me sometimes overnight
when I need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use the rosin, uh, rosin evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I usually use, uh, like the 25 I've
been experimenting with, like the 15
[SPEAKER_02]: micron and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask him about micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you guys like, like, cause I love the
15.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like the 15 cause I like the 25,
but I see a lot of like 37 and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 15, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Curious guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious about the screen size.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: 25 over here at 37.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends like anywhere from 35 down to
15, but mostly like 25 double wrapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually, uh, I'll double bag everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm doing like a mechanical separation,
I like to triple bag and I'll usually,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, I'll start from low,
low to high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why triple bag with mechanical separation
for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I really liked the fact of like the,
that third layer, I like to just rip
[SPEAKER_02]: everything off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, like any dust matter that's
hit it or anything that's stuck to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I got two clean bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that second bag is more of a
catch of like, um, like any, if any aid,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it really depends on the process,
you know, it's like a lot of timing and
[SPEAKER_02]: change of pressure and temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really depends on how slow you do
the process and how you ramp up the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, sometimes like certain
strains, it's, it's a really big learning
[SPEAKER_02]: process because strains are really
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that second bag is like
the secondary catch for any, anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even though it's on low temp,
when you're applying pressure with
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and terpenes, I feel like
terpenes and THC, the terpenes act as a
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent very much at that point,
because, you know, that's where the THCA,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, starts to push through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, so that's where you got to
really watch like temperature and
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I feel like that, that second bag
pretty much is going to catch what falls
[SPEAKER_02]: through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to make it down to the
third bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I'll basically just rip
off that third bag as like, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a protective bag, any kind of
like, like dust, if anything happens to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I said it, anything period,
you know, regardless, like it's mostly for
[SPEAKER_02]: dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'll pull that shit off,
like anything out of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like it to be as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's more and more in the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably you could probably be just fine
with two or even one, but I just feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, I like the three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm all listening to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I do too, man, three times
clean, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I do the same thing when I'm
refined.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it three times over like to take that
down that extra half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No blowouts.
Nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing too, is like
reinforcement in that screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're really applying, it's like
crushing a rock, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start to get the fucking terpenes
out of there, it starts to become a real
[SPEAKER_02]: solid, like form in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got a THC a Patty and
pressure to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, uh, when you're, when you're
starting to get them to like the wicking
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like certain different processes of it,
you start to apply a shitload of pressure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, I don't single bag anything
anymore.
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't done that in years.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I try it every so often.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, Oh, maybe I could do this 30
grand Patty without double bagging it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it always just starts the bubble out
and I'll stop the press immediately and
[SPEAKER_16]: then wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's just, it always teaches me
not to do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I use a wrap for my THC and I
like to use a five micron wrap.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but the five micron really
helps, I think keep the THC a in the wrap
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh, it keeps really, you know,
uh, really runny like you like it,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, uh, low viscosity.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's helped a lot with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The five micron or just a five.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could do it with just the five,
but to keep that perfect little shape.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you were saying, you're putting a lot
of pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like so a grown was saying, um,
so I wrap, you know, the 25 over it
[SPEAKER_11]: usually, but I could, I've done it with
just the five micron wraps as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: A nice clean separation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been separating like 150.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, just a hundred, uh, just the nylon
sheets.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're 12 by 12.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I use a rise in evolution, wash bags
and hash bags.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I use a 55.
[SPEAKER_22]: Five pound parchment from, uh,
from black label.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I, but I get it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I get it all from rosin evolution and
pretty, I used to press the 37,
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, you know, then I started doing a
double 37 inside a 160.
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, and then I've just kind of finally
ended up landing on a double 25 inside of
[SPEAKER_22]: a 160.
[SPEAKER_22]: The 225 act as my filtration and the 160
acts as my, my strength, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, I just, I've landed on that after so
long.
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate bullets.
[SPEAKER_22]: He's ever watched me live and had a
blowout times.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just end the stream.
[SPEAKER_22]: I start swearing.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just, I'm not a, not a happy cam for
when it happens.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've just given up on it and I just
double bag 25 then inside a 160 every
[SPEAKER_22]: single time.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I can help say to avoid blowouts
is like the heat.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if anyone else is like
really giving a good little small heat
[SPEAKER_14]: soak before they squish.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you get your couch in there,
yeah, give yourself a little heat.
[SPEAKER_14]: So can we start seeing the rosin come out?
[SPEAKER_22]: I've always explained it to everybody and
it's a really good analogy and everybody's
[SPEAKER_22]: really grasped onto it is when we're
pressing rosin, well with hash and with,
[SPEAKER_22]: with flour, but when we're pressing rosin,
you have to think of the trichome heads as
[SPEAKER_22]: little, little beach balls, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: And they all have a little bit of
different oil inside them.
[SPEAKER_22]: And what we're trying to do is we're
trying to exert pressure and, and,
[SPEAKER_22]: and, and heat and we're trying to melt the
oil and press the oil out of the bags.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not trying to go super fast,
super quick and press that hash out of the
[SPEAKER_22]: bag.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's, that's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_22]: Slow and low, get the oil and melt it from
inside those glandular heads and press the
[SPEAKER_22]: oil out that was inside those heads.
[SPEAKER_16]: So my problem is this is if I don't double
bag and the heads are too good,
[SPEAKER_16]: I just get slipped bags, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just, it's like a slip and slide.
[SPEAKER_16]: The thing wants to slide out.
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't had that problem, but I do
remember that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's like with like grease and
stuff when you're pressing like six star,
[SPEAKER_02]: five and a half star, five star,
whatever, like the bags want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's where, that's where like Bobby
was saying with the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like what I was having
problems with that on the gopher pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: on the long speak, but you know that I
started really like dialing in the machine
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, you know, you can really,
you can almost stop the plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll bring them down like as slow as
they can and they'll sit there on that six
[SPEAKER_02]: star.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you have to almost let it leak
out itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you start doing it right on,
right on the material, the more it's going
[SPEAKER_11]: to want to slip too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I'm pressing my six star too,
I like to pre-grease the patties and not
[SPEAKER_14]: just put it as beach sand in the pouch and
then do a directional fold.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to pre-grease the patties to where
it's like a pretty stable, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: sheet that almost looks exactly like the
pouch it's going into.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'll just fold it in half.
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to be a huge fan of using the
pre-press.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I used to pre-press.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like the pre-press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it by hand as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: It feels cool too.
[SPEAKER_14]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not productive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pre-press is for material that's not good.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that doesn't just finger press
like the stuff that we're pressing.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it's six star, you don't need all
that.
[SPEAKER_22]: And when you start putting six star and
higher melting ash, you know, pre-press,
[SPEAKER_22]: it'll actually start melting in the
pre-press just from the pressure.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my problem, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll put it on there and it'll just like,
I can't even get my fingers off it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so tough, man.
[SPEAKER_22]: Back to the explanation I just said,
you know, I've gotten away from doing the
[SPEAKER_22]: pre-press and everything.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was losing a lot of material on the
inside of the pre-press.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just an extra step.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was time, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just started scooping it directly
into the bags.
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, low and slow, you're letting
the press, I don't want to do it with my
[SPEAKER_22]: hands because that just seems like caveman
style.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm putting in the press and I'm letting
the press melt the heads and then I'm
[SPEAKER_22]: pressing the oil out, you know,
from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, when you don't
pre-press, you know, like the pre-press,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's with the puck or the puck
maker or by hand, I think the pre-press
[SPEAKER_02]: allows the hash to kind of fill the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, you know, you kind of have a
consistent size when you put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: press.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, you know, a lot of times too,
especially if you're pressing like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, five star and above,
like some super grease, if you're just,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're just putting a glob in there and
throwing it in there, nine out of 10
[SPEAKER_02]: times, it's going to work its way off the
blocks and you're going to have to flatten
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the goal is to get it as even in
every pocket in every corner and press
[SPEAKER_02]: that out real slow, you know, let it kind
of like just soak on the heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: work its way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then bring those blocks down slow
because it gets, there's a, every type of
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin has its own challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're working with like,
you know, more of like a full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: like where there's a lot more plant
particulate and everything's kind of just
[SPEAKER_02]: a mass, you know, you got your 150 all the
way down to your 40, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have more plant mass for it to create
a shape, not want to slide off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your blocks are able to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now you have, now you get into
more of the challenge of like how much
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure can I apply where I'm,
I, before I start pulling out undesirable
[SPEAKER_02]: oil where, where, you know, this is my
head and then this is my tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if I press every bit of
the oil out right now, I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: one decent good oil, but at the same time,
I can improve and refine by separating,
[SPEAKER_02]: not applying so much pressure,
leaving that last, you know, let's just
[SPEAKER_02]: say out of that bag, whatever you press,
you pulled 10 grams of rosin out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, rather than pulling 10 grams out,
you leave that tail end, which is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: only like a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, you're, you're leaving a
minute amount just to improve the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of rosin tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's different challenges
from the six star all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: full spectrums and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just, it's, it's,
it's, it's learning how to use your
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, whether those blocks are going
down too fast or whether it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, I can't be using a pneumatic press.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to shift over to a hand press and I
really need to guide it down, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's people pressing at 90
degrees, 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need blocks that they have full
control with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't be pneumatics, you know,
they need to be doing hand press or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that they can really gauge and
dial down for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all have our, our different ways of
getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very unique, very cool,
very similar qualities, but I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: really comes down to techniques and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's all different for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have a good, you need to have
a good resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your resin as well too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the number one man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the number one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Soil ground, you brought up a really good
point.
[SPEAKER_16]: The head and the tail end aspect really
isn't talked about much within the rosin
[SPEAKER_16]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad you brought that up because it's
something, you know, in my lab we talk
[SPEAKER_16]: about a lot and it's, you know,
that's the differentiation between in our
[SPEAKER_16]: opinion, phenomenal and, and really good,
you know, and, and it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: you like you're saying you can't inch it
into that phenomenal area.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just have to pay attention and be okay
with like not getting everything or
[SPEAKER_16]: separating that, you know, and
understanding that there isn't real loss.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more about redirecting it to other
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it's like, what do you
consider a loss?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, if you press out all the oil
and then you throw your bags away,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a loss right there because
essentially, that can be turned into
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just at what point do you look at
something as a loss?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just look at it as something that can
build up and become useful towards
[SPEAKER_02]: something else and, and keep your rosin
something that's going to be extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if, if you smoke it without that
tail end and you feel in, in, in your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart that it's like, man, this is so
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better than if I just add
this in, but you're looking at this as
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars, then that's what, that's where
you're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're gonna, you know,
you're stepping over, you're stepping over
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars to pick up pennies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, it's just really about,
you know, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want your product to be?
[SPEAKER_17]: You're sacrificing that minute amount of
tail end yield for the end quality.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're keeping your quality high.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've always said, the reason we're doing
this is because we want to smoke the best
[SPEAKER_22]: of the best.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we're separating this,
you know?
[SPEAKER_22]: So it kind of comes down to time,
temperatures, pressures, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: and then like, like everybody was just
hinting at not wasting the product.
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I'll only press,
you know, to exert or to get extract,
[SPEAKER_22]: excuse me, what I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_22]: All of my hash little pucks and stuff gets
set aside and the wife usually processes
[SPEAKER_22]: that with, with ethanol or whatever clear
down into RSO or something.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we don't have a hell of a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_22]: We try to, we try to use it all.
[SPEAKER_22]: But if I'm going to leave a gram,
of rosin in a bag because I want to only
[SPEAKER_22]: extract the good, I'll get that gram out
later.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll eat it later.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will enjoy it medicinally one way or
another.
Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what Sollier was saying is like,
yeah, you're right, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's, that's, that's, that's where you
got to make that decision, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's, it's, it's, you're stepping
over, over, you're just stepping over,
[SPEAKER_16]: stepping over everything to pick up what
for another 60 bucks or something.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a premium product, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's face it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how I look at it on
the, the, the, the aspect of like when it
[SPEAKER_02]: first, it starts with the water hash,
you know, if, if we're talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: hash rosin, you know, because like,
you know, the 40 microns can be good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but most of the times, if you really just
separate it, you know, isolate those
[SPEAKER_02]: microns and look and see how much weight
there is of each micron, you're really not
[SPEAKER_02]: losing much by separating that 40 micron.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 25, if you're doing a really good job
on your refining process and your
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation and doing things properly,
materials handled properly, you get
[SPEAKER_02]: minimal 25, depending on the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're working with dry trim,
things like that, there tends to be more,
[SPEAKER_02]: but from, from my experience and I'm used
to working with indoor fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I get very minimal 25,
very minimal 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, there's usually not
that much 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_16]: You say that we're, we're separating at
happy Valley.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're separating every single micron.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I haven't, I am still just not letting
go of like my old school method of like,
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotta know what's in every micron.
[SPEAKER_16]: And every, it's funny you say that because
like every variety Rosetta stone will give
[SPEAKER_16]: me a lot of 45, 25 C 99 gives me barely
anything in terms of 45, 25, but it's all
[SPEAKER_16]: in the 90 in the, in the one 20 in the 70.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, 73, I mean, so it's,
you know, it's, it's a, it's not like
[SPEAKER_16]: we're saying we're going back to the
variables of the cultivar, but it's for
[SPEAKER_16]: me, the 45 and the 25.
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason I brought it up earlier was
because I, I think that like you're
[SPEAKER_16]: insinuating is there's a place for all of
these micron sizes in the lineup of the
[SPEAKER_16]: quiver, you know, like you can offer the,
the head, what they want.
[SPEAKER_16]: And also 45 and 25 can be good for TA.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got a lot of, you know, cake batter
in there, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can not, you could actually throw a
little of that in there and allow stuff to
[SPEAKER_16]: cake back up.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, you're not hurting the
overall material, you know, you're at,
[SPEAKER_16]: you're blending, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just think it's important for
everyone to think about the micron sizes
[SPEAKER_16]: as, as tools that all can be blended in a,
in, in, in ways as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: as any chef would.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We take all our 219 down to the 180 and
then the, you know, the, the 89 down to 40
[SPEAKER_14]: you and save that all for edibles.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything else is, is either full melt or
it's rosin grade, you know, or both,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you just, everything else is
separated for edible quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not necessarily just edibles because
I mean, the terpene fraction may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: that great from the 40 and the 25,
but the THCA fraction that can come from
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really can once it's cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when you're talking about the
180, 150, like first through third spin or
[SPEAKER_02]: first through second, depending on how it
degrades, sometimes those can be fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rosin that comes off of them are
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely strain dependent,
you know, but it doesn't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_02]: to go to just edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can still be used in the refinement of
rosin, you know, mechanical.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I just say in our, in our situation
where we are in Oregon, we can't,
[SPEAKER_14]: our option is either do rosin or do
edibles or do full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: So to provide, we're just trying to
provide another option out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your rosin as quality as possible
and, and put everything else towards,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That people aren't talking about is you
only experience that partly when we start
[SPEAKER_19]: discussing the difference between fresh
frozen and dry.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because when we're talking about fresh
frozen, you guys are still having swollen
[SPEAKER_19]: heads because there's still moisture left
in those heads.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you get something down to a bone
dry and a nice full dry, you're going to
[SPEAKER_19]: get more of a separation of all those
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_19]: And sure, you're going to have a couple
that are going to shrink down a little bit
[SPEAKER_19]: more than you might want, but you're going
to get a better profile of what actually
[SPEAKER_19]: each layer is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because when it's fresh frozen,
you still have the moisture content in
[SPEAKER_19]: each layer of the head.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're going to have swollen heads in
some of those areas that might not even be
[SPEAKER_19]: that full melt.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what some people are
experiencing these days when they're
[SPEAKER_19]: saying, oh, I got six star, but it's
really not.
[SPEAKER_19]: We call that full melt.
[SPEAKER_21]: You run fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_21]: You definitely use a microplane,
shred those heads up, get that little bit
[SPEAKER_21]: of oil on the outside.
[SPEAKER_21]: So when a flame gets in there,
you can be like, look, it's melting.
[SPEAKER_14]: The heads after they're separated are very
similar to the heads when they're on the
[SPEAKER_14]: plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't really want to touch them too
much.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't want to disturb them too much.
[SPEAKER_14]: It starts the degradation process on them
at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: So leaving your resin as untouched as
possible is best.
[SPEAKER_16]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_16]: I look at it like grapes as someone
stepping on grapes to make wine or
[SPEAKER_16]: something.
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to damage those grapes
before you go and squish your grapes.
[SPEAKER_19]: They start to mature and oxidize quick.
[SPEAKER_19]: To make a vintage wine, you don't have a
controlled condition.
[SPEAKER_19]: So a vintage grower doesn't have an indoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: They grow outside without a tarp.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because what they're looking for is the
grapes that survive.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're looking for grapes that have
survived a drought or heavy storms.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully genetics will get there in 100
years.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's where that stress comes from.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where it's going to be
expressed more.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I come from the traditional air dry
method.
[SPEAKER_16]: I never even had any of this stuff coming
up.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was no tutorials.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was weird forums and chat rooms you
could go in.
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of them were cultivators and not
even hash makers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus was one of the first people I met
that I could talk to.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he had so much knowledge because of
Sam and all the people that he was working
[SPEAKER_16]: with.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was amazing to see all of this.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess what I'm saying is that there's no
wrong way to do this.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a lot of technique and there's
a lot of passion behind all these things.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of these ways to get there.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of different textures and
different profiles that you can get.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's really no wrong way.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's just several ways.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody can like a different thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We can all try and appreciate the
different things because it's all from the
[SPEAKER_19]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like blue shirts and you like red
shirts.
[SPEAKER_19]: That doesn't mean our shirts are wrong.
[SPEAKER_16]: My analogies are from music because that's
my background.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very much like music to me.
[SPEAKER_16]: All the things come together like
harmonics and then the instrumentation
[SPEAKER_16]: behind it and the type of strings you use
on the guitar.
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes and goes and goes for me.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think hearing everyone's technique,
watching Brian up in Maine doing his
[SPEAKER_16]: thing, it's really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because he's taking these methods that
I've known for years and really
[SPEAKER_16]: modernizing them in a way that's
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_16]: Major hats off to you up there at Best
Friend Farms.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm particularly using freeze dryers these
days, but I still air dry at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's cool to go back to the
conversation with that too, where it is
[SPEAKER_09]: actually market dependent, where we're
talking about the final form or the cured
[SPEAKER_09]: form of the resin where we're trying to
isolate that beautiful form and keep it as
[SPEAKER_09]: pristine as we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also the idea that it's going to
hit different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to hit middle and in between
brokers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to sit on the shelf or go
quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It will sit on people's table that don't
smoke as quick as we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that in mind, I think reducing the
final form of a resin where I actually
[SPEAKER_09]: will do the long two-week air dry,
but then also room temp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really go like room temp up to a couple
of weeks even after to see the stable
[SPEAKER_09]: form.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I call it whipping, but it's really
just homogenizing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll do a cool whip on my bubble cream,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do the cool whip, I call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll have it be grainy and harder
then, but it's really strain dependent for
[SPEAKER_09]: real first off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it goes to a room temp where I'll
whip it again and let it settle after that
[SPEAKER_09]: to homogenize and let it reach its final
state before it's going to change too much
[SPEAKER_09]: when it reaches the consumer.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not many people are doing that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's important though because you're
getting inside the head of the end user,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is always the goal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Easier by small batch.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paying a lot of attention to the
sterile environment and how to produce
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I picked some of that up from the
Emerald Cup back in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, from like a fail out for
microbacterial, which I had no clue of
[SPEAKER_09]: back then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's turned up my game where I just
asked around on grassroots level and came
[SPEAKER_09]: up with answers such as poly, sealed,
hermetic-esque drying environment to start
[SPEAKER_09]: with.
[SPEAKER_09]: But clean cultivar, organic practices,
clean cultivar, organic practices as we're
[SPEAKER_09]: all seeking resins.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also seeking the terpene profile
almost more so.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these loud strains, excuse me,
that everyone's after, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when we're organically farming the resins,
they're speaking that real true nature
[SPEAKER_09]: also strain dependent very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then the cultivation technique after
produces the fire as bubble or rosin,
[SPEAKER_09]: obviously back to regenerative where
you're going to actually be farming for
[SPEAKER_09]: terps, not just specific terp profile,
but how to produce those terps under that
[SPEAKER_09]: profile also to let them speak the
loudest.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, man, that's well said.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that said, what are you guys
getting ready to plant for hash making
[SPEAKER_16]: this season?
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anything going into the ground
that you guys are really excited about on
[SPEAKER_16]: the right coast?
[SPEAKER_09]: Strawberry Angela over here.
[SPEAKER_22]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: I honestly think people think I'm nuts,
but I think I'm just going to stick with
[SPEAKER_22]: what I know and what I've grown outdoors
and what produces very well for me here
[SPEAKER_22]: and what I enjoy extremely well.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's my critical cush.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll probably just throw that in the
ground, throw five or six of them outside.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we stay underneath the numbers and
yeah, it produces very well.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just, I went through throwing
different stuff outside before.
[SPEAKER_22]: And when I do now, it'll be the one plant
or something because I've just had plants
[SPEAKER_22]: that do extremely well indoors and then
outside it's horrible, fails, falls on its
[SPEAKER_22]: face.
[SPEAKER_22]: So unfortunately, sometimes I don't like
to fail in those instances when it comes
[SPEAKER_22]: to having my medicine.
[SPEAKER_22]: So sometimes I stick with what I know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe that's when you can learn from
another person's errors, someone in the
[SPEAKER_21]: same terroir, someone nearby.
[SPEAKER_28]: The lotto S1 and Forbidden Skittles did
very well for us last year and we're doing
[SPEAKER_28]: them again this year.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're very resonance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grow some OG outside for hash
making.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a common thing either.
[SPEAKER_28]: We did Iranian OG last year.
[SPEAKER_28]: That was not good for us here.
[SPEAKER_28]: It flipped away and got really,
really big, really fast.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then it was like really hot.
[SPEAKER_28]: Not again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so rare to find a good OG that does
well for like solventless.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_16]: This, I got some dying breed here.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to give her, give a go.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some Beasel dog here.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's some OG right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_20]: Triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_20]: That looks proper.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it show and tell again?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this is some flower rosin actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this was separated.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the same press.
[SPEAKER_12]: We separated it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask about your press there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that thing on the market now?
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: We released it at FJ BizCon this last
year.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was the second portion.
[SPEAKER_12]: So because the oil collects to the center,
we're able to move the parchment paper as
[SPEAKER_12]: the oil separates.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hear everybody talking really about
washing sieve and washing hash to clean
[SPEAKER_12]: it, to separate the microns.
[SPEAKER_12]: A late discovery after inventing this for
scalability, we had oil control.
[SPEAKER_12]: And because we had oil control,
I noticed the different melting phases of
[SPEAKER_12]: oil because I was able to move the
catching area and separate the kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: qualities kind of, in my eyes,
pressing with flower rosin, separates it
[SPEAKER_12]: or cleans it in a different form.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's pretty interesting how,
when all the rosin flows off of the
[SPEAKER_12]: parchment paper, how it kind of trails
behind each other as far as melting
[SPEAKER_12]: points.
[SPEAKER_12]: But with it coming straight off of the
bag, off of the parchment paper complete,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're able to separate the different
quality and phases.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something new.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you can watch the head and the
tail as it starts to come out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could actually just, that's why I'm
seeing like 28% returns on some flower on
[SPEAKER_12]: this XXXOG one.
[SPEAKER_12]: The last harvest, not this harvest,
was 24%, because it all always matters,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're able to essentially press it all
and separate the good quality yellow stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: from the darker stuff all in one press,
extracting everything, but still
[SPEAKER_12]: separating the two for production
purposes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: As a corporation, you want to be able to
get everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every penny matters.
[SPEAKER_12]: So leaving any oil in there, especially
for another process, is time for the
[SPEAKER_12]: processor to put it back under the plates
and press it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to definitely have a process
that had adequate pounds per square inch
[SPEAKER_12]: that could extract everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, again, a late discovery after
the invention was, oh, shit, this is
[SPEAKER_12]: yellow, light yellow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, now there's a drop of dark like it
always trails on two flat plates that I
[SPEAKER_12]: pulled it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I saw the dark separate from the
light.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a video on YouTube under Axis
Roz, and that shows the first time I used
[SPEAKER_12]: the prototype of this one that did that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was the Sea Junkies Cushment.
[SPEAKER_12]: That we pressed indoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the guy, it was trim.
[SPEAKER_12]: He stored it cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was really curious about what
crumble came out first versus the dark,
[SPEAKER_12]: saucy, terpene stuff in the back.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know the terminology between the
two in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was like, I know the BHO process,
as far as understanding that you have to
[SPEAKER_12]: winterize the lipids and fats to extract
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Roz and we're kind of doing like a
reverse engineering of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: By liquefying the terpenes and oozing them
off, holding back the lipids, the fats,
[SPEAKER_12]: and THCAs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just kind of playing with the melting
points as far as production-wise.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking at it in the scalable form for
facilities to, again, extract everything
[SPEAKER_12]: in a shorter process.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I could dial that down from
pressing flour, Roz, and straight,
[SPEAKER_12]: or flour, straight to Roz, and without any
cleaning process, and doing the cleaning
[SPEAKER_12]: process during the press is something I've
just recently been able to replicate
[SPEAKER_12]: consistent with two harvests at two
different timeframes and get the same
[SPEAKER_12]: exact results.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's the cultivar behind you just like
dumping?
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's not a squish.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a dump.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like that shit's falling behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's just because the capacity.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was all about scalability.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I try to create what is the most
comfortable throughput capacity per press.
[SPEAKER_12]: That a press could withhold.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I kind of sat at a quarter pound
four bags at 28 grams per bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the video on the green screen back
there is a video I'm working on on
[SPEAKER_12]: production and premiere right now to
showcase this entire process I'm talking
[SPEAKER_12]: about.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that.
[SPEAKER_21]: 28 grams of what?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the triple XOG.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you dealing with hash at all?
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you tested any hash at all?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's some videos on my YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out Kalikosher up NorCal.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_12]: I drove up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to commit 200 grams of hash into
a brand new press.
[SPEAKER_12]: But essentially, I just had to show them
that it works the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's two heated plates in a controlled
manner with the bag at the edge of the
[SPEAKER_12]: inside of the plate where they all
collaborate and collect together.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it just multiplies how much you could
do and control the oil into a collection
[SPEAKER_12]: form.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so hash or flour, it really it's all a
press turning it in.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really genetic.
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the variables you guys have been
speaking about with what you put in is
[SPEAKER_12]: what you get out is the ultimate rule of
thumb for rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, the press is just the equipment
that just is trying to make it easier for
[SPEAKER_12]: the throughput capacity of large scale
production in both flour and hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, at 200 grams per press.
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem I'm running into is the
scalability of ice water.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now with Wizard Tech and everybody
coming out with huge production ice water
[SPEAKER_12]: machine, Goldilocks being the producer of
one of those machines.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're seeing some massive amounts
of hash that could probably keep up with
[SPEAKER_12]: throughput capacity of pressing it,
collecting it, and actually separating the
[SPEAKER_12]: melting points of the rosin and creating
different products.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: What were your size presses?
[SPEAKER_25]: Right now, we have a couple of different
Sasquatches that I use right now.
[SPEAKER_25]: We got a couple of M1, the new M1 presses
that they have out.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what's the amount of hash you put in
there?
[SPEAKER_25]: We do smaller presses, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_25]: We do smaller presses at a little bit
higher taps, quick presses.
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what I find to be the best
overall thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it gets off of the plates, it's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Higher temps is not a bad thing,
as long as it gets off of those plates.
[SPEAKER_25]: We've done everything over the years.
[SPEAKER_25]: I would say I like these.
[SPEAKER_25]: We kind of just have a process of,
I have noticed a difference in yield over
[SPEAKER_25]: time is going up in bag size.
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what I was going to ask
everybody.
[SPEAKER_25]: What weight is everybody putting in their
bags and pressing per press?
[SPEAKER_25]: We have it at a ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do 14 in a bag, and I'll do two bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: What size bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: What size bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a two by, I mean, the amount of
bag that I use, it's probably after I fold
[SPEAKER_02]: it, probably like two by four,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Micron size?
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll either do 10 grams in a two by three.
[SPEAKER_22]: By the time I fold it over, it's usually
about a two by two.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll do 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or I'll do 20 grams in a two by four and a
half, which ends up being about a two by
[SPEAKER_22]: four.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like using a 25, three by eight and
putting like 14 to 20 grams in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a 20 inches square.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though it's a trapezoid shape,
we measure it by square inch.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we just calculate how much
volume, like for a flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: we get a little over like, a hundred
percent per bag.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what's your, what's your yield back on,
on that solar ground?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing 30 gram presses right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've, I've the last in this past last
year, I've just been all over the place,
[SPEAKER_16]: but I'm seeing a lot of good success at 30
grams at seven, you know, above 70%
[SPEAKER_16]: return.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what I look at is, okay,
so I have a, basically with like the six
[SPEAKER_02]: star, I need to get at least 90 to like
92% back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with 28 grams and two 14 gram pouches,
I can get 90 to whatever, whatever I need
[SPEAKER_02]: to, I hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hit at least 90, 90% back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, like when it comes to
full spec, things like that, like the full
[SPEAKER_02]: spec first, like, you know, not
necessarily full spec, what I call full
[SPEAKER_02]: spec, you know, is it would be like the
70, 90, 120, sometimes the 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually on that, you know,
I look to get back anywhere from 84 to
[SPEAKER_28]: like 87% back, you know, you say two 14
bags.
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you do the two 14 in one bag after you
bag them or are you putting them side by
[SPEAKER_28]: side on your press?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, side by side on the press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause and, and it's got a little gap in
between it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like, you know, if I'm going to
put, okay, so I feel like with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: what it does is it reduces the amount of
mass and like how far the center mass is
[SPEAKER_02]: from, from the exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I have two bags, you know,
they can get out from the center quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to travel through so much
mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just kind of like, it's all,
it's all theory in the head, but are you
[SPEAKER_02]: still using the long speak?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I use the long speak.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you guys are hitting you.
[SPEAKER_16]: What temperatures are you guys are at?
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are at 180.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are at 190.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like what's with that type of return that
seems like a higher temperature,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I press hot, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I press like anywhere from two 10 to like
what people call it real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I press hot too.
[SPEAKER_25]: Two times like on the low end.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm saying two 10, two 15, two 25.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'll hit, I'll max out at like two
30, but it depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got, there's, there's super stable
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they, they react differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to get it off the block in about 45
to 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to go over 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really don't like to really go much
over about 1500 pounds of forest or
[SPEAKER_02]: however you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm able to like monitor all that shit.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I got strains that we'll,
we won't have to go above 500 on.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: And as you know, the six star for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're getting into like the fucking
second, third wash, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed micron shit, you have to apply more
pressure because now you have more mass.
[SPEAKER_25]: The no melts.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I think the press like a peer
pressure, the M1 from Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_25]: Cause you can just dial it all in.
[SPEAKER_25]: We press all of our microns, everything
separately.
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't mix anything in the press.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: We, I don't, we, we judge everything pre
press and then, cause we, we just have a
[SPEAKER_25]: lot of, a lot of every micron.
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's enough capacity to separate all
the microns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're, you're always, you know,
I love to mix, I love to mix strains too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when it comes to rosin and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I, one thing I'm like really
big about not doing is when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: washing them, I won't wash like,
let's say I want to do like fucking a
[SPEAKER_02]: three fucking three blend, like this
strain, that strain, that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to wash them together until I
know what each isolated micron does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, if I know like, okay,
this strain dumps in the 90, this strain
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't dump in the 90 and it puts a lot
in the 70 or it's putting more in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is telling you where the quality on
that strain is lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then you start to mix like the
degraded parts of other strains with
[SPEAKER_02]: quality parts of other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like washing everything
separated until you know what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated micron is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as how you grade that quality
of those microns, that's when you can wash
[SPEAKER_02]: them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, just watch everything
separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to the blends,
dude, like, ah, man, I'll sit here and
[SPEAKER_02]: have my fucking, I'm like, I feel like I'm
a chef when it comes to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll fucking come up with, and it's like,
go ahead and try to figure out what it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_28]: When you think about it, it's like a
little bit of this, a little bit of that,
[SPEAKER_28]: a little bit of this, a little bit of
that, mix it all up, press it,
like.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we just did some fun mixtures at
work too.
[SPEAKER_22]: Back to the times and temperatures,
I'll do 160 degrees.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll always do a directional flow so
that I get my rosin off the plates as
[SPEAKER_22]: quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_22]: I do do with a 30 second preheat,
I'll do up to two and a half minute press.
[SPEAKER_22]: That, like I said, making sure that I get
the rosin off the plates as soon as
[SPEAKER_22]: possible.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but I never press over maybe 170
when we're talking hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll never press over 170.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm a 180 maximum, but I've been
playing over the last year with anywhere
[SPEAKER_16]: from between 220 all the way down to 90
degrees, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's, you know, each varieties as
we've been talking is going to give you
[SPEAKER_16]: something different.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I found a nice range between the 170
and 190 to be kind of a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_21]: You should really be specific when you're
talking.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's for hash only.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm talking about hash right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make that clear,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about hash right now only.
[SPEAKER_16]: Flour, I would start, I would press flour
at like 210, 200.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll simplify the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would press.
[SPEAKER_22]: Flour in 190, 200, but I've completely
given that up.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will not press flour anymore.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, me neither, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: No exceptions.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like double refined concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, there are some strains that
make really good flour rosin, but for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most part, you know, I feel like it's,
my theory on it is that it's probably less
[SPEAKER_02]: fats and lipids present in that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you press it, the clarity and the
stability probably has a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes present and shit,
but it's just like my observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like a couple of things about flour
rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: What I like about flour rosin is it gives
me the ability, because I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_21]: flour, when someone gives me flour and
lots of people give me flour, to be able
[SPEAKER_21]: to take that nug home, run it through the
helix or the M1 or whatever, and get that
[SPEAKER_21]: little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: And not only does it give me a nice
experience like that, where the person who
[SPEAKER_21]: can actually take it and appreciate it,
but it's also that I'm now learning as
[SPEAKER_21]: well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm seeing more different types of flours,
different moisture contents, different
[SPEAKER_21]: rosins.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like I'm dedicating a lot of time
to it, but I still find it to be a very
[SPEAKER_21]: nice learning experience.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's basically what I love about
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, super good point, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I think that is a very important
test to have in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to processing new material
or something that's not consistent or your
[SPEAKER_02]: growers saying, hey, this run was a little
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always best to have, like when we're
going to wash hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll throw some buds in a jar with some
ice, shake it up, see what falls off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it even worth washing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's still not going to tell you if
it's going to do good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just tells you, should I give it a
shot?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to any kind of new flour
coming in, if you have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: press the nug and say, hey, this nug
pressed out 30% return on it, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got an opportunity to do a killer job
in the wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you present it to the wash,
it might not do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might only be a hydrocarbon slash
flour rosin extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to either learn to refine that
to the best of what it can be as a flour
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin or choose that it can, and it could
probably make great sift and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: refine it that way, press that in the
rosin but if you're looking for a hash
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin, some strains just don't cut it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great test.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like just the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I'm curing my weed and I just
got it cut down because of course I grow
[SPEAKER_03]: my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like going in there, start pressing day
four, grab a couple of mugs and then I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: take some, put it in the freezer,
then I'll do my wash and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't like pressing flour that's
anything over a couple of weeks old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never, but I like that fresh press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those first couple of weeks, you get that
fire, you get those turps, you get
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you only, if you're growing
it, you get that experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like you're saying, John, if you can get
it at that optimum time, I've made some
[SPEAKER_16]: amazing flour rosin out of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: My garlic that I made is amazing like
that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I ran flour that was in my freezer from
two, when was my last crop, John,
[SPEAKER_21]: like 2014 or something?
[SPEAKER_21]: You keep muting yourself, like literally
like muting yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unmute myself, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to hit the double button and
double button.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had Harmony in my freezer for years,
like seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I took it out and it was in a
Ziploc bag and it was just sitting on my
[SPEAKER_21]: desk here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And after like a couple of days I opened
it and I kind of was like, ooh,
[SPEAKER_21]: this is like nice and like spongy.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was all, I knew I grew it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like, it's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was Harmony.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was from Reefer Man and it was his own.
[SPEAKER_21]: At first when I got it, he was kind of
like, oh shit, like kind of a little
[SPEAKER_21]: upset.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I was like, well, what do you
want it back or whatnot?
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, no, no, no, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't realize I gave you like,
he gave me like his cut of his Harmony.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really special.
[SPEAKER_21]: But that rosin was some of the loudest
rosin I ever made.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I went to a couple of events like Lyft
conferences where I was like quite far
[SPEAKER_21]: away from people and I would open it up
and on the parchment, it looked like a,
[SPEAKER_21]: like a baby's diaper.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was just this yellow snot on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was unbelievably like really quite
incredible rosin.
[SPEAKER_21]: And people would be like way far away
going, do you smell that?
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it broke all the rules that heat is
gonna, you know, oh heat, that ruins all
[SPEAKER_21]: the turpines and oh, it's aged.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's how old it was like in the freezer
for how many years and then sat on your
[SPEAKER_21]: desk.
[SPEAKER_21]: All I know is it was some of the loudest I
ever made.
[SPEAKER_21]: So don't get caught up in what you assume
that sometimes will keep you from making a
[SPEAKER_21]: really nice revelation.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you, that hash that when I came and
visited you in BC, man, that was like,
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know how old that was more
than a decade.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, guys, I was more lit than I've been
lit in a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was special.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really special.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was delicious too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: So don't let it fake yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I've got to get going guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've almost crushed four hours.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got about 20, less than 20 minutes,
17 minutes.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got to come up with the last most
valuable tips and tricks we can offer.
[SPEAKER_21]: No particular order, but whether it's
from, for, for collecting parchment,
[SPEAKER_21]: whether it's for how you're bagging your
trash or moisture content in your flower
[SPEAKER_21]: or temperatures or all of the things we've
spoken about.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you feel like you've missed on any of
those things, some of the people that
[SPEAKER_21]: aren't talking as much, I love to hear
from you guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know some of us are a little more
aggressive voices, but if people that have
[SPEAKER_21]: not been talking much want to want to
chime in a little bit more, I'd like to
[SPEAKER_21]: hammer out 17 more minutes and call it a
press.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll call it a press.
[SPEAKER_28]: So how soon does everyone collect off
their parchment from the press?
[SPEAKER_28]: How long do you let it set or settle
before you actually pull it off?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it depends on how much you're
pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a grip, it'll sit there until I'm
done pressing all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes that's a couple hours or
whatever, but usually a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to watch the strains too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause some strains want to sit there and
nucleate while you're sitting there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I usually press in a cold room too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, stuff stays pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I do leave it, unfortunately it
just sits there for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate when you go to collect it and it's
already like, like almost converted over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like half crumble and half stable
and now you're collecting, now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: crumbling up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it takes forever to collect.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll generally collect as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_22]: But like everybody says, I'm pressing and
washing everything in a cold room.
[SPEAKER_22]: And from doing the classes and talking to
the majority of people that I've talked
[SPEAKER_22]: to, that I think is one of the biggest
mistakes that people make, especially when
[SPEAKER_22]: it comes down to washing live resin.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's a whole other topic of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_22]: But when we're talking about washing like
fresh, like off the plant, cut off the
[SPEAKER_22]: plant into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_22]: When we talk about washing stuff like
that, which is what I consider fresh live.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't do it in a cold room,
you're asking for a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're basically going to be scooping
Elmer's glue off of your, your screens.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a cold room.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need very cold water.
[SPEAKER_14]: The environment needs to be extremely
cold.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to process fresh frozen
from start to finish and you want to do it
[SPEAKER_14]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've mentioned it before, but there's
these tables and there's these stones that
[SPEAKER_21]: you can get that are like chocolatier
stones there that you can keep them on
[SPEAKER_21]: certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Those, those, those are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, especially if you're getting into
the business aspect, if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_21]: be in a cold room necessarily,
the entire room doesn't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_21]: to be that temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: You might end up giving yourself colds and
whatnot over time.
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's actually a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_21]: Having a collection plate itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: And they have, like I say, the really nice
chocolatier tables that you can set to the
[SPEAKER_21]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: It does not change that temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: It creates a thermocline where that
temperature is like at least an inch or
[SPEAKER_21]: two inches off that, off that table.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: You see them take warm chocolate and pour
it on liquid.
[SPEAKER_21]: And all of a sudden, depending on the
temperature and the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_21]: chocolate, I think there's a lot to learn
from the collection of rosin and the
[SPEAKER_21]: manipulation of rosin from the chocolatier
and from the, the taffy pullers,
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, guys that have been doing that
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: If I was a rosin company, I would
definitely like, I see that on a resume.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, yeah, I would like to pick your
brain because I mean, you, you got to be
[SPEAKER_02]: careful with condensation though,
when it comes to tools like pulling units.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're working in a cool ass room
already, essentially your tables are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you don't want really cold
rooms because now you got to work a little
[SPEAKER_02]: slower because stuff wants to shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you have like that right
temperature where the oil just wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it's easy to collect cause
you're pulling up sheets of rosin rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than like, if you're pressing out like
five grams at a time, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: a thin layer of, of rosin with the,
with the little drips, which the drips are
[SPEAKER_02]: super easy to collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you get to that thin layer and you
got to kind of like, I wipe everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll fold up a sheet of parchment and
I'll just actually like, I'll fold up a
sheet of parchment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nowadays I just use my gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have my nitrile glove and I'll
just collect with the nitrile glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm real good at just making sure I
get every drop off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're quick with the glove,
you're in a cold room, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_28]: Silicone fingertips, like literal big
little blue guys and they've got little
[SPEAKER_28]: nubs on them and they go over your gloves.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then it will, I roll it like I'm kind
of crazy.
[SPEAKER_28]: I literally roll all the dough with the
kind of flour and then I end up mushing it
[SPEAKER_28]: together and putting it in.
[SPEAKER_28]: I kind of play with it first.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: I will always agitate my rosin mix,
pull, whatever the heck you want to call
[SPEAKER_22]: it.
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't taffy it, but I roll it together
and then I put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_25]: We taffy when we mix different microns
together.
[SPEAKER_21]: And are we, are we taffying for
homogenization?
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we taffying for lighter color to come
out?
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we taffying for all of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll taffy, I'll taffy for, yeah,
homogenizing when I'm doing flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: blending, micron blending, for the most
part like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, if I don't, if I'm going to make
jams and stuff, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't need to, there's no reason
to.
[SPEAKER_22]: And to me it goes, to me, it goes back to
the very first conversation we had is
[SPEAKER_22]: curing the rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: It introduces air into the, into the
rosin, which is an oxidation, which
[SPEAKER_22]: induces curing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're also stretching it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't like to stretch it out
when I'm going to make jams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you think about it, if you're going
to make jams, if you're going to stretch
[SPEAKER_02]: it up, that was a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start introducing a lot of
little bubbles full of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is going to speed up oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you apply heat to it, that's going
to rapidly speed up oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like when you have a nice fresh
press straight to a jar, and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do the jam tech with that,
you're going to get, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve like a slightly lighter color
compared to something that was introduced
[SPEAKER_02]: and locked in a little more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cool point.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a cool point.
[SPEAKER_22]: I generally don't go any further than
rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't make the THCA.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't make diamonds.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I don't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I don't do sauce.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't introduce it to heat.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm cold cure only.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just cure rosin over seven to 10 days
in a, in a cold room in a dark box.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I usually like to shoot for 30 days
before I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just can't wait until we start really,
really finding out if we are curing,
[SPEAKER_22]: let's walk down the road of if we are
curing, you know, we can, we can start
[SPEAKER_22]: talking about like, like aged cheddar for
Christ sakes.
[SPEAKER_22]: We can start talking about six years or
six months, 12 months, one year,
[SPEAKER_22]: two year, five year, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_22]: One year aged hash or rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: Man, it could be a whole new ball of all
the worms in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do like rosin once it's cured and
developed more, you know, like kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: like wine, when you let it sit and age
more, it does develop more flavors.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that definitely happens with rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been times that I've had rosin
develop over the month or two,
[SPEAKER_14]: and it just changes completely from when
it started out, you know, it might be
[SPEAKER_14]: expressing one feet.
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy balls.
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's glass.
[SPEAKER_22]: And don't get me wrong, I like to grab,
you know, a lot of times when I'm in the
[SPEAKER_22]: hash room and I'll have my dab rig sitting
right there and I have my tool,
[SPEAKER_22]: my torch and everything, I'll heat the son
of a bitch up and I'll take a fresh dab.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I'm not knocking it, you know,
but I prefer the one month cold cure or
[SPEAKER_22]: longer if I can.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to do like, you know, seven to two
weeks, seven days to two weeks,
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm doing a cold cure, that's when I
really like to do the taffy pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to get everything completely
homogenized, same color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it kind of speeds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if you're going to do
that, throw it in a jar and into like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, let's just say 40 degrees and
let it sit there for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to completely,
you know, go through the whole nucleation
[SPEAKER_02]: process and become like a nice crumble
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start going to your whip,
you know, you start giving it like a heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: whip, then you start to get like,
you know, a nice wet batter.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't like to leave a lot of room in
the jar between the rosin and the lid.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to get it as full as possible,
but you got to keep in mind though,
[SPEAKER_14]: certain strains will separate real hard
and you'll have a, a turkey layer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is best to, you know, to put some
parchment under the lid if you really need
[SPEAKER_14]: to, if you're going to fill it that full.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you're giving it very
little head of oxygen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just like anything, like when you're
trying to preserve something, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't do all this work to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, you know,
you're, you ruin it.
[SPEAKER_22]: The bad part is I think, I think I must
need like a telescoping, like a little jar
[SPEAKER_22]: that smushes because every time I take a
fucking hit, it gets more head of air in
[SPEAKER_22]: it.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you think about it, dude,
these baller jars that you see everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, you know, I'm guilty of it too,
dude, but these baller jars, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like putting out a two liter of Coke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a quarter of the way full.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: This will literally be gone in three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_28]: So that way we're not going in and out of
the fridge all the time.
[SPEAKER_28]: You have one that you're constantly
dabbing out of, that you have your one,
[SPEAKER_28]: well, one to four grams, depending on what
you want or your different flavors.
[SPEAKER_28]: So you have them all sitting around,
but that way you're not actually touching
[SPEAKER_28]: your stuff that's sitting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I like to do too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I use the little seven or nine millimeter
jars and fill them up as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to smoke on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: I do too usually, but these quarantines,
I brought out a different, a different
[SPEAKER_25]: size jar.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's anyone going directly to jar.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was doing that for a little while and
then it became a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to, I was like, eh, can't get most
of this out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like to really decide what I'm
going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll just work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get everything pressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to have like my
formulation session where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's kind of like an assembly
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll go through this process,
that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get it all done, pressed out,
knock that work out, and then figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do I want to jar it up fresh
pressed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to do this to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do I want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to manipulate this shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, how far do I want to take the
process?
[SPEAKER_21]: I know how far you want to take the
process.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right into your dab rig.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's what I want to add.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want everyone to answer with the last
questions because I suspect 90 plus
[SPEAKER_21]: percent of us are dabbing this shit.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your temp?
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you dabbing off of and what's your
temperature?
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, great question.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to go at 560 when I'm using Rosin
and you know, around 500 for my full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the device I use to meter
everything.
[SPEAKER_25]: I like 630 temp tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends if it's melt, if it's melted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the 4s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got this freaking turp slurp from
Toro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that thing hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the mini now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's no other way to smoke for me
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't even want to fucking hit
anything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same, my guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once I got one of these, it changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if you guys don't have one,
I suggest getting in line to get one or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the little pro for inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way it just fucking winds it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It throws the dab into your fucking lungs
like a hardball, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: In one rib too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's like one and done.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even at low temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really think about it, dude,
it is the most fucking even, like evened
[SPEAKER_02]: out hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it spreads the oil perfectly evenly
across the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way it falls across it and just
right into the lungs.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my favorite nail too, for sure,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets the job done better than any other
nail I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_22]: By far.
[SPEAKER_22]: I usually dab about all the e-nail over
here set at five and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_22]: But for some reason I've turned the torch
so much more.
[SPEAKER_22]: I really want one of those temp tech
things.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm actually in line to get one.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm usually in the real low 500s.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm dabbing off of the Peli nail lately.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he sent me the great quartz.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's at 450.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm dabbing at 450.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's surprising because all the other
nails I have, the mini nail and the
[SPEAKER_21]: davenator, they're not the same
temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: The nail versus your e-nail temp can be
completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, dude, for sure.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well think about when you go in and hit
that nail too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I dive in at 630.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I go to dip the nail in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that temp's dropping so fast,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I hit it, it's probably like
580, some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why the e-nail, we like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: The e-nail doesn't drop the same way,
but the torch definitely drops that way.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the temp tech teaches you that in the
first hour that you own it in a way that
[SPEAKER_21]: you can't even believe.
[SPEAKER_21]: It changes the way.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you what though, I'll be the
devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be the devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_22]: I like my big globs.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's once in a while when I want
that son of a bitch to punch me and I'll
[SPEAKER_22]: go in hot.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'll go in hot because it just,
it hits you just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like going hot every now and then too.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: We all need some of that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Johnny B and Pedro are right next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you guys, if John, if you go to your
left and Pedro goes to his right,
[SPEAKER_21]: you guys will legitimately give each other
a high five.
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_21]: High five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my bangers are always challenged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always go in hot and heavy, but I like
that hot dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they're like, you guys are
like four.
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: 87, 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm up here in the hot and heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sit back and hold on to life for a couple
of seconds afterwards, buddy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Brian's holding up a nice one for Best
Friend Farms.
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you got there, man?
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_16]: You hit me up on IG with that banger.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a couple of these for you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was actually the creative design with
Mr. Gray, my better man, Mr. Gray,
[SPEAKER_09]: and the Grasslab port with a round bottom,
like a test banger.
[SPEAKER_09]: So homie Pedro's got one there too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one Grasslabs did with Mr. Gray
helped me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of simple design.
[SPEAKER_09]: He prefers this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of listened to his advice and I hit
this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to hit my raw, like my raw bubble,
my, you know, the six star gap.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm aware of that, too.
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks like a three or a four,
probably a four.
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks fatty.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just got this eternal quartz.
[SPEAKER_22]: real deep bucket.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, man, when you talk about,
when you want to talk about taking a big.
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that a 10 milli or a 14?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a 10 mil down here.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was gonna say.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's a 30 mil up here and it's really
deep.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, yeah, you want to talk about
dropping a freaking half gram.
[SPEAKER_21]: You get a little of resin like
condensating in the like coming back into
[SPEAKER_21]: oil.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but what I usually do with my,
this is another trick that I do when we're
[SPEAKER_22]: talking, we want to talk about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_22]: I usually use drop, I usually use drop
downs like they're actually on the rig
[SPEAKER_22]: generally.
[SPEAKER_21]: But if I don't have a drop down,
it's plugged fucking solid.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not smoking through this.
[SPEAKER_22]: What I'm doing now is when I hit my
headies, I'll hit them without the drop
[SPEAKER_22]: downs because I actually don't have a 10
million drop down and I usually do the
[SPEAKER_22]: globs and I don't, I don't smoke it till
it's freaking gone.
[SPEAKER_22]: I always have a big puddle in my banger.
[SPEAKER_22]: So you guys have probably seen me do it
the whole show.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll bust this out.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll pour my dab the leftover into this
and then I will, I will warm this up,
[SPEAKER_22]: pour it into capsules.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes I'll mix it with the coconut oil
as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I, and I eat that as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: So man, you want to talk about trying to
just get everything out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're really, besides boiling the freaking
roots, we're down to everything,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, listen, we've just done four hours.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to give everyone a chance to
share their Instagram account to where
[SPEAKER_21]: people can find you.
