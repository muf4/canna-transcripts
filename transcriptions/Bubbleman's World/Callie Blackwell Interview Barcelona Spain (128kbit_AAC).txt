[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we're here in Barcelona at the
Spannibus 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually in the city right now at
the W Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here with Callie Blackwell,
who has practiced a very deep level of
[SPEAKER_00]: civil disobedience in order to,
I guess maybe originally give her son a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher quality of life, but also to
actually extend his life and bring him out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a near-death experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Callie, I'll leave it up to you to tell
the viewers here on Bubble Man's World how
[SPEAKER_00]: this all transpired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Callie Blackwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a UK activist and I got into cannabis
because in 2010 my son was diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_02]: acute lymphoblastic leukemia and then two
years later he was diagnosed with a much
[SPEAKER_02]: rarer form of cancer called Langerhand
cell sarcoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: This left him to be the only person in the
world to have the two cancers together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because there was no protocol for him,
doctors decided to give him a bone marrow
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now unfortunately, Darren had four bone
marrow transplants in 10 months because
[SPEAKER_02]: each one subsequently failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two from the donor, one from himself and
then the last and final bone marrow
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant was his own cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren had been through radiotherapy,
five years or four years of radiotherapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy, say because there was no
protocol, their words were we will give
[SPEAKER_02]: him everything we can without killing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had adult doses of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three days after he had his final
transplant, he trapped his fingers down
[SPEAKER_02]: the side of his hospital bed and picked up
two catastrophic infections in his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with the brand new bone marrow trying
to kick in and it usually happens within
[SPEAKER_02]: 21, 23 days, but it was just struggling
far too much with these catastrophic
[SPEAKER_02]: infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had one in his mouth as well,
which was a kind of portion of his tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was in a really bad way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told us that nobody has ever been
grafted with a bone marrow transplant
[SPEAKER_02]: after 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't happened by 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So day 46 came.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd always had many, many conversations
running up to this saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've only got one chance left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew it was coming, but on December
the 8th, 2013, they said to us,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, there is nothing else left now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go to a hospice.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, how long are we talking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw his antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only things that were keeping him
alive, apparently I saw them as a
[SPEAKER_02]: conscious life support machine because
Darren was very aware and he was part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always very open with him about
every part of his journey because it's his
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his life, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they told us that once they unhooked
him from the antibiotics, we were looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at three days a week at most.
[SPEAKER_02]: These infections would ravage him.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did we want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: So December the 11th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: When would you like to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say he was in a bad way,
but what about mom?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you were with him the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were basically experiencing this
horror from the other side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a roller coaster ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never bought a ticket to, and I couldn't
get off and I couldn't get up from there
[SPEAKER_02]: from July the 30th, 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on that roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that day, that very first day
that they told me he had leukemia,
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew there was a chance we could lose
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast forward four years and the roller
coaster I'd been on, I'd already grieved
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd already accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very matter of fact, everything
that happened at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for me, especially,
it was a guarded way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'd have allowed my emotions to take
over, nothing would have got done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it would have been four years of
hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, we don't have a choice
of what happens to us, but how we react to
[SPEAKER_02]: it, that's everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have that choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a parent, I just picture,
yeah, fetal position, corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you are in your head.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at night when you're on your own and
you cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found writing very cathartic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because Darren was so rare and he
was the only one in the world to have
[SPEAKER_02]: these two cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence why my book is called The Boy in
Seven Billion because he was the only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started a journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started writing and blogging about him
in hope to find other people with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, by the time we got to
the hospice, he had 12, 13,000 followers
[SPEAKER_02]: on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was finding every day I was writing
what was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was getting feedback from people
saying, I'm too scared to check on
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook in case he's dead, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, but I found it very
cathartic at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that was my therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the hospice and Darren
didn't go within the first three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was December the 11th.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd just turned 14 on December the 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went and as I say, he didn't go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Christmas on December the 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had another Christmas on December
the 25th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had New Year's and Darren was
still here, but his organs were slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: shutting down.
[SPEAKER_02]: His stomach was producing a pint of bile
every couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having to draw it out of a nasal
gastric tube because if I didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: he'd vomit and the tube would come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd have to have another one put down and
that's very traumatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, having to do all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a case of waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darren started to get very anxious
because he just wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sat down and we planned his funeral.
[SPEAKER_02]: We planned the venue, the hearse,
the music, the costumes because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: fancy dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren had an idea it would be fancy dress
and he picked some very tongue-in-cheek
[SPEAKER_02]: uniforms for many of his family members.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was certainly going to have the last
laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the things that really
grabbed me about this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching the interview with both of you
sitting there and talking about planning
[SPEAKER_00]: his funeral and just the positivity in
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His eyes while he was explaining it and
the smiles and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, like this is the thing that most of
us on the planet are the most afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are terrified of death
and here you have a child, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: facing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he couldn't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the planning of it, he wrote a will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he only had a PlayStation and a
couple of watches to give away,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also wrote letters to family
members, picking them up on their behavior
[SPEAKER_02]: and literally giving them advice and
saying, look, if you carry on in this way,
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you know, life is too short for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite something to have a child who's on
his way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that term, you know, life is too
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, like no denying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, day 69 came around and Darren was
still alive and kicking, although he was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I say things were slowly
shutting down and the doctors were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, this is the beginning now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this is, this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darren starts to get very anxious now,
sort of two, three months previously,
[SPEAKER_02]: because Darren had the catastrophic
infections in his hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically his fingers here down were
black.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were necrotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were literally dying on the end of
his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been crying about this this morning
and immediately I thought, how did he
[SPEAKER_02]: feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm crying over one day of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like this for a couple of
months, you know, literally feeling his
[SPEAKER_02]: hand die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanted to amputate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped them from amputating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, look, I don't want him maimed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I want him to die pain free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want him to die on morphine
because he didn't want to die on morphine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he'd written a death plan saying
that they'd taken everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not taking his death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to die conpus mentus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I talked them into giving them a new
rectum here where they took out the
[SPEAKER_02]: nerves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually quarterized the nerves so
that he'd never feed his hands again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, look, he'll never feed his
hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll never use it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But previously to that, I'd asked him for,
he was on fentanyl, he was on morphine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing was touching his pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a look at alternative treatments
for pain and Betrakan came up,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a cannabis based product
available in Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd read an article about a guy who
got it on prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd gone over and so I said, look,
we can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to go to Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not licensed for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works very well on neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, so I thought, okay,
well, I'll do it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Main ingredient, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got some from a friend who I'd met.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made just a vegetable glycerine tincture
with the plant, took the plant out,
[SPEAKER_02]: left with this honey kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it in a vape pen for him because
he was in hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, if he can have a vape pen,
it might work on his, but it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt quite cool sitting in the hospital
room like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The room was much, you know, it felt
naughty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's how old at this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: 13, just 10 and 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it was like, well, I tried and
failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think any more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fast forward now in the hospice,
it's day 69 and he's very anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they start upping the morphine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd asked for a bone marrow aspirate
to be done where they go into the main
[SPEAKER_02]: ball joint and they take out a piece of
bone marrow and then they can look at it
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell you exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more accurate than a blood test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got on there, his neutrophil
count, which is the white blood cells that
[SPEAKER_02]: fight infection, were 0.0005, which is
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, look, please do another test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me that there's definitely nothing
there because he's still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he should be dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Day 69, it came back, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the nurse coming to me with a
piece of paper and I opened it and I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both me and Darren had talked about
this and we both hoped that there was
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing because as sad as it was,
I didn't want to see him suffer anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets to the point, you know,
when your dog is poorly and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that decision, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly the same thing, but it's a
child.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we both looked at each other and
went, good, it's just a matter of time
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the end of the prodding and
the poking, end of the hospital visits,
[SPEAKER_02]: end of all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say they start to give him morphine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started to be in and out of
consciousness and this wasn't what he
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took the morphine away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still very anxious about, when am I going
to die?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking he's going to die and he just
didn't know when it was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sleeping tablets obviously made him
very in and out again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just thought, well, as a mother,
I have to give him what he wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In his end of life, I can't do anything
else for him other than ensure that he
[SPEAKER_02]: gets his very last dying wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my only duty now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just thought, I saw this tincture and
I thought, I'm just going to give him a
[SPEAKER_02]: load in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It chills people out, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of just chills people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave him five mil under his tongue,
sublingually, and within half an hour,
[SPEAKER_02]: his whole demeanor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally saw the relaxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could literally see it in him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, about half an hour after that,
a nurse came to the door with a drug
[SPEAKER_02]: called cyclazine Now, Darren had become
incredibly addicted to this drug,
[SPEAKER_02]: so much so that he would scream at the
nurses if he couldn't have it every few
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way they had administered it to
him had caused, it was almost like heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was incredibly addicted to this
drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the nurse come to the door and I
thought, oh shit, what if I've now caused
[SPEAKER_02]: some contraindication and I can't tell
them what I've given him and oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't need to worry because he
turned to her and he said, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was after one dose of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five mil of a tincture made with
vegetable, because it wasn't even fecal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a whole extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, go, go before he changes his
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you sure you don't want that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no, this is enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, cannabis has given me everything
that that drug gave me, but without the,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was off his face when he was on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no, I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping tablets stopped, the morphine
stopped, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an exit drug straight away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it was already a miracle
because this was going to give him the
[SPEAKER_02]: death that he wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, this was already a miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I continued to give it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the following few days,
he was really chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, we had a really kind of,
he became very introspective as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He became very quiet in himself and really
started to think about things and he
[SPEAKER_02]: really accepted death then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was really ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no more panicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five days later, we sat in the lounge and
Darren had a heavily bandaged hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like Mickey Mouse, he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, don't take those bandages
off because underneath, it's down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bone and it's surgically just,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's there with his hand like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He woke up, he pulled his hand out and the
bandage in the middle was off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, mum, look at my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with your hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even register that there was a
third bandage missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, my finger, look at my finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looked like mine, but much,
much thinner at the top here, but with no
[SPEAKER_02]: nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was healed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hang on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is wrong because you can't even
create skin cells without functioning bone
[SPEAKER_02]: marrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said to the doctors, we need,
we need another test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were running around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to do a blood test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, literally five days ago,
there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, we need to do a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a blood test.
[SPEAKER_02]: An hour later, it came back and his
neutrophil count was 0.25.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had almost, I don't know how many,
like, I don't know, a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the nurse, the doctor was like,
well, so what do you want us to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want you to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said to Darren, well, you know,
usual protocol is now, if you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, we will give you antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you want us to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, I want you to leave me the
fuck alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the doctor said, well, that's very
flippant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, 10 seconds ago, he was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're telling him he's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're asking him what he wants to do
as far as medical proceed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I continued to give and his account
just got more higher and higher and
[SPEAKER_02]: higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he officially ingrafted on day 104.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 days after the maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone ever grafted?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nobody after 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He truly is the one in seven billion boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately it got worse after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: His mental health deteriorated just
chronically because now he didn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hospital was, because I couldn't
tell anybody what I'd done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hospital were now saying, well,
we don't know if he's going to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know where, and they literally
said in front of him, well, he could drop
[SPEAKER_02]: down dead next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this limbo, he was now in limbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he explained it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, mom, it's like there's a door
open and everything you've ever wanted is
[SPEAKER_02]: behind that door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to the threshold and someone
slams it in your face and says,
[SPEAKER_02]: not today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to turn around to hospitals
and needles and drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just went, I don't want this
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a period of six months,
he tried to kill himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took shoelaces away from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took belts, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were evicted from the hospice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also took the cannabis away because I
wanted to make damn sure that it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I took the cannabis away,
his blood count halved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I gave it back, it doubled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that over a six blood test
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew, I knew that it was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always love to tell you it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we haven't done clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would rather say it was a miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call him a miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would rather say it was a miracle
than anything else, even now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so for the next six months,
the route he chose to kill himself was
[SPEAKER_02]: through starvation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would literally refuse to eat
anything for six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got down to about 24, 25 kilos,
which I think is about four stones,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like 60 pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you a picture and he was
skeletal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anything like it except
for on documentaries of Auschwitz and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was skeletal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the most horrendous six months
because cancer is one thing and treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're almost a passenger to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was now Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to encourage Darren to
eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was, no, no, because I couldn't
give him a future to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was devastating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanted to section him,
sedate him, and force feed him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked for some mental health care and
was told that he didn't qualify.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he never saw anybody for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was left to me and my pop psychology
trying to get him to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got involved with some local
cannabis clubs because obviously I'd seen
[SPEAKER_02]: what cannabis had done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started to branch out and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found a very local cannabis club,
some lovely people who kept telling me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to meet this guy called Jeff
Ditchfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to meet Jeff Ditchfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, who's Jeff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to Google him.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a friend of mine said, look,
I have a villain in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take him to Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take him on holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't been away for years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to talk the hospital into
letting me take him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, look, if I take him on holiday
and I come back and he's still refusing to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat, I will sign him over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took him to Spain and that was in
July 2014 and met Jeff the following day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only wanted to say hello to him and
thank him for his work, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he then looked at Darren and said,
my God, he looks like he's dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, he can't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I think I can help with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, you know,
because I, again, didn't think about the
[SPEAKER_02]: eating side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even care about the munchies,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, look, he's a syringe of oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lemon, lemon haze, I believe it
was, gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And took him back to the apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the following day, I gave him a tiny,
tiny little bit on a crisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, don't eat this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because drugs, he'll try anything,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen him on ketamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen him on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had no qualms in giving him this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so half an hour, an hour later,
I was prepping lunch and he was down by
[SPEAKER_02]: the pool with his brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I shouted down, do you want anything
to eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Expecting the same grunt to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darren shouted up, make me loads,
I'm starving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So straight away, I gave him food.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate for 12 hours the next day,
and the next day, and the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just, his life came back into his
eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very, very thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: People in Spain were looking at him like
he was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, he looked incredible because I
had seen him when he lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had come so far already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in the pictures in my book,
the light in his eyes could just switch
[SPEAKER_02]: back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was back in the room, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: After 12 days in Spain, we came back to
the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the doctor took me to one side and
said, my god, his mental health has
[SPEAKER_02]: improved by 300%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens when you eat food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to die anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, he doesn't want to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, he's put on four kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, the holiday didn't the world
a good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, yes, it was the holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we'll leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll accept that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll accept that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Sunsea and, you know, they'll accept
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I had to stay quiet because I
was terrified of social services coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in, taking my children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only would Darren, you know,
be taken into care of, he'd lose the one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that now clearly was working for him
again, you know, cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second time cannabis has
brought him back from the brink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's been on oil every single day
since July 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day without fail, 150 micrograms,
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it micrograms or milligrams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 milligrams every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the things I have seen since that,
so it was a miracle the first instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time was a miracle in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happened since is miraculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: His hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can feel only the tips of his fingers
he can't feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: About two weeks after he came back from
Spain, he starts saying, mum, my hand's
[SPEAKER_02]: hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, your hand can't hurt, mate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no nerves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hand can't hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, mum.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, it's like electric shocks coming
down my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rewiring the nerves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neurogenesis was rebuilding neural
pathways in his hands for around the
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, now he has problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to pick things up like this,
but he has full range of movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to be a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, oh, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I literally slap his hand on
his oncologist desk and go, explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear, I don't want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has avascular necrosis in his right
femur, which was basically an inch of bone
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of his femur, which was dead,
necrotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was due to steroid use while he
was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blood couldn't get to the bone,
so it died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told me that within five years he
would need a knee replacement,
[SPEAKER_02]: if he were to survive, because this is
irreparable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't repair dead bone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it was about six or nine months
ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an MRI scan because his left leg is
very twisted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bones are physically deformed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had an MRI scan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sat in the oncologist office and he
said, I believe you were under the
[SPEAKER_02]: impression that Darren had avascular
necrosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, I wasn't under the
impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the scan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to see them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, because I believe you must
have been under the impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, you're going to tell me it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, yes, but that's
impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, clearly it's not because
it's happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, I don't see any,
I don't see this in any of my other
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, none of the other patients are
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I knew you'd say that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, I'm going to keep saying
it because it's the only reason why my
[SPEAKER_02]: son's still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got 60 people out there that
could benefit from it, and you'd rather
[SPEAKER_02]: put your fingers in your ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, this is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The avascular necrosis has gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neorectomy, it's been fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's now six years post his last
transplant, well, almost six years post
[SPEAKER_02]: his last transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are saying that he should have
cataracts by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have a heart murmur at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have issues with his internal
organs because the amount of radiotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: and chemotherapy, they blast in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should be having now, it's called
long-term side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live longer than five years,
if, because that's all they go for is five
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get past the five-year mark,
they then start looking for these
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Darren's going in regularly and there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not even a sign of any long-term
side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are bamboozled.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sits and goes, cannabis,
cannabis, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's had it written on all of his
medical records.
[SPEAKER_02]: He stood over his oncologist and said,
I want you to write what I did and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: was taking and what I'm taking now because
I'm still taking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it on my notes that I don't take
any of the four pharmaceutical drugs that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to take for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's had maybe two colds in the last five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been, honestly, he's one of the most
healthiest people I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's supposed to be infertile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think next month he's going for a
fertility check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's 20 this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be 20 in December.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's gone for a fertility test because
he wants to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, don't rest on your
laurels with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can guarantee him anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to end up having millions of
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just been incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just night and day from the,
I mean, it doesn't help from my
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective when you have the word harm in
the first five letters of the word
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strange thing to have that word
harm of all the words you could have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the word that's supposed to represent
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think of all of the things that
just kept going wrong as they continued to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just the story that you told,
that is so incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just, you know, cannabis
truly is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that there are people in this
world that would rather, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: put their fingers in their ears and not
hear it, it's criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a criminal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beyond negligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sickening to allow parents and the
loved ones of these sick people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sick people themselves to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just when it's, how can we not use the
plant-based medicines as the first line of
[SPEAKER_00]: defense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we always have to wait till three
days before death?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in the UK, you know,
like I see what's going on there in the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's not good with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they're doing and the way,
I mean, this other little guy who they
[SPEAKER_00]: were, took his medicine away at the
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is, this is like what you would
expect a demon to do if you ever came
[SPEAKER_00]: across a demon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, yeah, it's completely just
evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it must be a miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you were under the impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly why I feel that I do what
I do now is that obviously since,
[SPEAKER_02]: since all those followers that Devon had,
they all saw this miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started to get inundated with
people who wanted the same miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I tell them what I would,
what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of them would say, Oh no,
I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is sad, but I respected that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the last five years,
because I wrote a book and I've been on
[SPEAKER_02]: television and I've been very open and out
about this, I've been in parliament.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've told the chief of police what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've told the MPs what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was arrested outside parliament not long
ago, protesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dressed as a suffragette as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of, it was a public,
I didn't intend to get arrested,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make very good photos, me in cast
dresses as a suffragette, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred years later, fighting for the
right to give my child cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a hundred years ago, I couldn't vote,
but I could give my child cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tables have turned, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so now I'm inundated with people who
come to me again at the end of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a shame that it's usually at the
end of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so now I've seen, I've seen this plan
to perform miracles hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: of times since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds of people have come off
pharmaceutical drugs and onto cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've come to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now, I will now introduce JJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So JJ is, she's my right-hand lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've both been working in cannabis,
but it was came a very natural organic
[SPEAKER_02]: join between a pairing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really between us that the people
come to me, I do a lot of consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk them through cannabis and because
many of the people have never touched
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in their life when they come to
me too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to, I'm giving them their first
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm helping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking them through and, and then JJ
mixes up the oils to the preparations,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ratios that we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sources the oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make sure that we know where it's come
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So JJ has very good content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our, our standards are so high because
this is medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's alcohol in there, that's not
supposed to be in there or if there's all
[SPEAKER_02]: this contaminant, contamination,
or we don't know what the, what the
[SPEAKER_02]: profile is, every single piece that every,
every tincture that goes through us is
[SPEAKER_02]: tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know exactly the profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because it's the only way that you can
administer medicine properly when you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this, we have this little
relationship going where we work very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's, yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't do what I do without JJ,
you know, she's been a godsend to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can now help far more people than just
me on my own, you know, so we,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, and we've got other people,
we're starting to get other people on
[SPEAKER_02]: board, but it's very difficult because
like I said, our standards are so high
[SPEAKER_02]: that not many people can meet those
standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of people saying,
Oh, I have a load of oil here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to, can you get rid of it
through me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, was it tested?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll get some tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the time the test goes back,
it'll all be sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you either have it now or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not peddling your, you know,
so that makes it difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: We often have people sitting waiting for
test results to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not release that oil until test
results have come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are very stringent like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually in the UK, although things
aren't good on the public side of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: public opinion is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The public have, I, before I wrote my
book, well, while I was writing my book,
[SPEAKER_02]: before I decided to publish it,
I used to look at public opinion and
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not I would be safe coming out
as a mother, giving my child an illicit
[SPEAKER_02]: drug, because I was watching people be
very, very angry about mothers over in
[SPEAKER_02]: America who were giving their children
cannabis illegally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just for potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why are you giving that to a child?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, doctors know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very much that kind of rhetoric
and it scared me too much to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrote my book and I left it a few
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I looked at public opinion again and
it had changed dramatically to,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, obviously we know that cannabis
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was more of those
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on the television.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the first, well, I was the
first person to ever go on television and
[SPEAKER_02]: admit to breaking the law and actually
giving- Yeah, I like that interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of other mothers in the UK
who really do, their children need to have
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis right now and they're begging the
government to give them what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wasn't going to beg to be a lawful
customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My son's health was their paramount,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was the first one to come out on the
television and say that I'd actually
[SPEAKER_02]: broken the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stigma.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was absolutely- And fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of stigma and a lot of
fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even now there's a lot of stigma and a
lot of fear that are stopping these
[SPEAKER_02]: parents from embarking on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since then, since going on the
television, I've watched public opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: again now sway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are now at a point where 99% of
people on comments especially are,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, yes, cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_02]: My nan uses it or my- Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they are ready to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's snake oil salesmen and
there's all sorts of sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: disinformation about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the media push out CBD or cannabis or
cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The media have used the word cure in the
same sense as CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're fighting against the
misinformation, the propaganda,
[SPEAKER_02]: the reefer madness, everything that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people now, if you were to tell
them, well, I gave my son cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go, wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things have really changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need the government to- But the
government are doing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lining their duct up in a row so
that they can be personally profiting from
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about- Many people in the UK will
say, look at America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how much money they've made that
they've paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado have paid for schools,
healthcare, this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, in the UK, our government
don't care about how much money they can
[SPEAKER_02]: put in the public purse.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only care about what can go in their
pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you've got our prime minister,
whose husband is the biggest investor into
[SPEAKER_02]: GW Pharmaceutical, and our drugs minister,
whose husband owns the land at 220 tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk he's grown on every year in the UK,
and yet it has no medicinal benefit and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not allowed to have access to it,
mass hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it makes you psychotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the UK's media for the last 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll be able to sell it as a medicine
and reap the benefits.
Ours is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your son must be absolutely blown away
and inspired by how his experience has led
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys down this journey now of helping
all of these other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does he think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He must see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sees it, but I think he's quite
nonchalant about it, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very- Devin lives in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was diagnosed with autism, eight years
old, and he also has Tourette's syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's also seen that be treated very
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell when he hasn't added oil for
a little while because your autistic
[SPEAKER_02]: traits start coming out and you see it
again with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he is, although he's very proud of me,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I say that because he's never
told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to presume that he is,
but this is Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect anything like that from
him, but I know that he must be proud in
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm doing, that I'm going on and
helping other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows now that he comes second to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that, and so does my other son,
because this is far bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren has put me on a journey,
and now his journey is to carry on
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever he wants to do with his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now my journey, and he has firmly
put me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's quite happy to come second to
cannabis because he knows how important it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to me and to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only reason why he's still
breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm very glad to be able to share
your story to my audience and to try and,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said earlier, I would love to get
you on to the past church.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try to raise some money for your
group.
I would love to, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally in the story, in the time when
we're online and we're talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when really people are the most
susceptible to be able to just hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: donation button.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to be able to help,
especially when they hear a story that's
[SPEAKER_00]: so incredibly inspirational like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, what a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was how many years?
[SPEAKER_02]: From 2010 until 2014, 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, four, four and a half,
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get taken to a place with your
child where you actually want them to die
[SPEAKER_01]: and where a child has been through so much
that at 14 years old they want to die,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then cannabis turns it all around
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't this available for everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what drives us to carry on really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Kelly's experience, she knows
exactly how it is for a mom to be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation where you actually want to
release your child through death.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the only release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it all comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are watching right now,
how can they find you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the social media addresses,
websites, the book titles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they find all this information
about you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: So on Instagram, I'm The Underscore
Cannabis Underscore Activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: JJ is at Ganja Nanja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm on Facebook as Kelly
Blackwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a public page which I answer many
emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a public page too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my normal one, just Kelly Blackwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a website, KellyBlackwell.co.uk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to update that very often,
unfortunately, so it's more like a holding
[SPEAKER_02]: page, but you can be directed to all of my
social media pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a donate page on there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go straight through to my PayPal,
which I don't expect people to donate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if they want to, then it will directly
go to help because this is a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: not-for-profit thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't make any money on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't make money on top of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because you have a soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I can't morally,
I can't morally take, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't morally make money from someone
that I know how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not from the journey that you just took.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how that feels, and I don't want to
put financial burden on top of that as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not to say that, hey, we do need
companies that are going to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it accessible on a mass scale,
and those companies will require to make
[SPEAKER_00]: profit so they can continue on,
but it doesn't have to be this
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical model where it's 10,000
times the price, and it's only our product
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's patented, and it's some
synthetic version.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's isolate, so it's got,
and like I say, I was saying to someone,
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidiolex, which is the GW Pharmaceutical
CBD oil that they brought out in November,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the four children who have been lucky
enough, I say lucky enough, to be
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribed in the UK, three of them now
have gone completely backwards,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, have gone worse than they were
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally like zombies, and it seems
to be, I think it's in the insert of
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidiolex, it says about the strawberry
flavoring causes severe degeneration in
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the main nerves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the delivery system that they managed
to patent because they can't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: patent cannabis itself is damaging the
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because out of greed, they want to control
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there has to be side effects,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be repeat custom,
otherwise a drugs company goes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's no repeat custom, then the
drugs company will go out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's business sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it on a business sense,
it makes no sense to make something that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, that's the end of their
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of this young girl from
Sweden who's been standing up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, Greta, I believe her name is,
she went and slapped the UN, the who in
[SPEAKER_00]: the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just was like, you guys aren't mature
enough to take care of the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she had a quote, and I'm trying to
remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very powerful quote, and it was
in regards to what we were just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about right now, but I've lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, you'll just shout it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I wish I could sit here with you
guys all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally, I love the vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some of the most important civil
disobedience that's going on on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really like, I can't say enough good
about what you're both doing and continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this journey, and no matter how hard
they come at you, never, never stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, listen, thank you so much for coming
in and talking with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, we're going to be staying in
touch for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, absolutely amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing women.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing the really serious good
work out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm very honored to even be invited
to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, yeah, it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this will be, this will be the first
of many conversations that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
