[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here is the Soul Shine Bubble
Hash 11 year old from Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pick it up Adam?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take to press out guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would say probably, sorry,
there's one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'd say it probably took, you know,
four or five hours maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to fold in on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, flip it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that is a slab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the weight on that final?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was about 40-ish grams here
and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's rock solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright dude, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime man, always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching guys.
See you next time.
