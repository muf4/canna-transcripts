[SPEAKER_00]: Tony V joining my book, my friend here,
Rocky.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I was going to kind of
demonstrate a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know we run terpenes for
you and I saw that you had a water plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and you gave me like an ounce of bud the
other day and said see what you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and I handed him back this jar and
he was like oh yeah that's great doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know what it is or what it does and
it smells like lemon tree but you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: like not really sure what it is and so you
know you don't you can't smell it at home
[SPEAKER_00]: but smells exactly like lemon tree well it
came from the lemon tree bud and if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had lemon tree it smells exactly like
the lemon tree people think it's fake
[SPEAKER_01]: people think that shit's like not real so
this is lemon tree right here translates
[SPEAKER_00]: real well translates really well so what
this is is we took the rosin from this and
[SPEAKER_00]: we made it into a water suspension but we
also binded it to a xylitol from birch so
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is is a sweetener with the lemon
tree flavor with THCA and so what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: this a lot different than anything else
this is yours right you have been using it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit a little bit so let's open
this up so this is lemon tree water
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't taste regular spring water regular
spring water I consider this the holy
[SPEAKER_00]: grail for people that are in your water
business I'm just on the ingredient side
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're gonna put a little bit in that
was probably a little less than a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about I would say 10 milligrams now
here's what makes a difference now this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what called a water suspension we're gonna
watch this thing move around and over a
[SPEAKER_00]: course of a few minutes we're gonna get
all of the all the rosin to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb into the water you can see it
already happening and while it mix that up
[SPEAKER_00]: while that's happening I'm gonna show you
what it looks like in a course of a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes you'll see it that this has been
ours instead of a solubility think
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension so that way it never falls out
so it means every every single taste and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's accurately dosed which is hard to do
and to do it organically so watch what
[SPEAKER_03]: will happen is what will happen is it's
almost done it'll literally hold
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in play now think about this
from another standpoint now this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: water so before we get fancy with it why
don't you try that now
[SPEAKER_00]: now check this out we want to add a sugar
so people are asking me what the hell is
[SPEAKER_00]: this this doesn't it's so good right just
on its own this is terpenes no THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: made into made into a Jack Frost sugar so
smell that getting everybody involved so
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're gonna make a lemon Jack shake
that up
[SPEAKER_00]: all right now try it now you're gonna get
little Jack Frost is a little sweetener so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you taste both of them right
which is important so one doesn't over
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate it's pretty crazy so hopefully
this will kind of like every cup I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do something new and release something
usually takes a little bit for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: get what's happening but coming from
somebody that's you know you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: create the lemon life and everything lemon
tree so I can tell you that our lemon tree
[SPEAKER_00]: lemonade was the first thing that sold out
just gone people coming back today asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for more of it I wish we had more next
time we need to do a lemon stand and just
[SPEAKER_00]: do it in bulk let's talk about cultivating
in California yeah people are failing
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides left and right you know 80% of
the industry is on that and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really truly value organic growing and
what that means why don't you tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about the lemon life and what
goes into growing lemon tree well since
[SPEAKER_01]: day one we've been about the organic soil
soil-based biology of growing I worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: a hydroshop for a long time I sold a lot
of nutrients and stuff but you saw the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from all the stuff that you sold
so it was clear that you know organics was
[SPEAKER_01]: always such a superior product than the
hollow synthetic nutrients and we really
[SPEAKER_01]: pride ourselves on staying with organic
soil-based biology yeah I see on my side
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody tells me they're an organic
greenhouse grower that doesn't use
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or sprays in particular because
even in the second leaf it already has
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes forming and so the potential of
the plant under the Sun is really in
[SPEAKER_00]: control of the cultivator but when it gets
to our end and we have to process it for
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin or we have to process it for full
melt or into terpenes or into pens yields
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes and yields of cannabinoids now
play a huge huge part but it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: worthless if there's pesticides because
then it's just medicine that nothing we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it so I hope that you know as
people advance into the industry they
[SPEAKER_00]: realize and respect and really give credit
to the farmer where needs to be done so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I like working with you because
every time we do man your stuff yields
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable quality so appreciate it you
you you you you
