[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was going on a couple of
weeks ago about being of service to other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the real gifts that we get to
have in this industry, is to make other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, I was up at the Groningen Drug
Center for research, and I went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital there because my wife was getting
a liver transplant at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran into a, well she wasn't a young
lady, but a middle-aged lady who,
[SPEAKER_00]: she saw me and understood that I was there
working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says, can you get me some
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she was dying of pancreatic
cancer, which is not only really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult to beat, but it's one of
the most painful deaths that you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, my company, we're breeding
all these unique varieties of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was, I found her some
cannabis the next day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it to her, and you know,
a few days later I saw him.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, oh, I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I says, and I says, well, you know,
it's not going to be a cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, yes, but what it does is it
lifts my pain, me above the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have the pain, you know,
just driving me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she was able to, you know,
lift her spirits above the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we as a company, we never dealt with
patients that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a medical research and development
company, but what our end goal was to,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this was in the early 90s,
was to bring cannabis back into Western
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine because it was not there at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we were very successful at
that, which helped a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: further down the line.
Thank you.
