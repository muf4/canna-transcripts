[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am here in beautiful Squamish,
BC at an undisclosed location.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been invited by High Integrity Glass
Art, who's throwing a show for Yoshinori
[SPEAKER_04]: Kondo, incredible glassblower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some beautiful glass in the
house here, so what I wanted to do was
[SPEAKER_04]: just a quick little introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a VIP day for buyers to
come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rashaun has invited me in prior to his
good buddy's house, who's allowing him to
[SPEAKER_04]: throw this event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super excited to check out the glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gentleman is an absolute next level
glassblower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys recognize the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've videoed him making glass in the past
at High Integrity Glass Art's studio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're here today, October 20th,
2021, checking out some of his latest
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible glass, High Integrity Glass
Art.
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously your favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the cup for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tube's a TK Hapa Yoshi Cola.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sake tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: A sake tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the ode to Japanese culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's got the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, just in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that is subtle, but beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always excited to see what these guys are
capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is really kind of the highest
level of glass production.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all these years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all these years of photographing and
getting to experience it, it just seems
[SPEAKER_04]: like this is the pinnacle right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flip the marble over?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Europe 72.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: The detail is absolutely astonishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might have to get the macro lens out on
that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a couple of ships.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Flower of Life Ballerina Hive
Series 4C Day with the Ewok Turt
[SPEAKER_05]: Elevators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nothing but the best, clearly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then marbles from Yoshi.
[SPEAKER_04]: The man himself.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Ewok marble set.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the carb caps are just perfection.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been too long since we've done this.
Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm glad that you're back at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is wonderful to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little Jerry Bear.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very Dead inspired.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that Europe 72?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are heavy, Grateful Dead fans.
[SPEAKER_05]: As they should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl I was shooting on in Cali the
other day, they were all dead heads on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, like the craziest number of people.
