[SPEAKER_03]: But here we're live now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not live, but I turned on the camera
and anything you say can and will be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, yo, radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, hey guys, welcome to Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're freshly done with Haas Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Matt from Sasquatch Rosin
Press Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we've got the M1 here and we're
about to rip up, actually Flav's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: house too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to bring some of that ash over?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flav 421 is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen this guy in ages.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's brought us some lovely hash here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this sweet skunk has the smell
that I'm interested in acquiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice color.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to get it into a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be very turpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I better show them because they'll
kind of be like, well, what does it look
[SPEAKER_03]: like, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, is it nice?
[SPEAKER_03]: Old color, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nobody's taking my word for anything
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one believes me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how close it's getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that sweet skunky, got a little
tulle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want to stick my finger in your
cookie jaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hit this one first, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do we have a tool to scrape hard,
maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: A business card?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put two on the shelf in there on
the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the water bottles, there's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just break it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, break it up, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we might also need a business card to
get it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was using those little golden bags
that were sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a business card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have a business card on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two of them on the left of my
shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two business cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Telus business card that was right
in the corner here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it in the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sasquatch business card.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we weigh this and find out what
we're dealing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tear the bag real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we should be looking at like 0.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between like 0.72 to 0.74 is like pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.74.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't smell it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.73.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a sweet scone press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got a whole shwack of other
things to press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come in nice and close with
the camera when we press it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll move the camera real close up so we
can get it on those plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we're going to get all of
that in one little bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to melt super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got to fucking turn the plates
down, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sitting at 210, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff's going to melt at least like
180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whatever you think, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried pressing it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I pressed it at 170.
[SPEAKER_01]: 170?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have any oil traveling through
any plant matter to try to escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's almost just there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love pressing the ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always gets your corners packed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash is prepared there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.7?
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.7 grams, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the folded parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to get the plates
prepared first a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, get your
parchment and your plates prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to the size opening that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: To just push it in gently so it's not too
tight, but slides in nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also so your bag doesn't flip open.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good main point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the plates keep it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For hash, I always go in just about like a
quarter inch to a half inch, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: how much you think the expansion of the
bag will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like to keep everything tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your pre-press right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many of those cranks on the hand
pump will you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably two or three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, with this, I'm just going to
ease into the pressure really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it already starting to melt
through the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, as I push, it's pushing it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to push the bag out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The bag's pushing out a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah yeah, nice style.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulled the whole parchment from the
back through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very simple, but very effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: No need to open it up and try to push it
back into the parchment when there's oil
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when I pulled on the parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to straighten the paper out
in the beginning.
So we
[SPEAKER_03]: lost our show a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still pressing rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still got our money shot to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see it coming up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making its way to the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working anything super, super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we're pretty much at good
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to really slam down on hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to blow out the bag right
at the end or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't pack it too fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was just five grams, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very lovely and wow, the sweet skunk
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bag is just soaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely going to get more out of there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to do a second press,
the best thing to do is do it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of the low temperature that
it did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a sweet, sweet color on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the second press, I always like
to keep it warm and do it right away so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't have to reheat it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of start smashing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're in there already smashing round
two on the first batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it some nice pressure on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did too is I folded it in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always do that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'll even fold it a second time
if it's a really big like 30 grams of hash
[SPEAKER_03]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'll fold it twice, make it a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you're trying to get every thing
out exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it'll blow out your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to look at this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't even do second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hit it at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the right temperature, but a higher
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll extract every little piece of oil
out and there's no need to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely going to be some fire-ass smoke
right there though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab here soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a picture just before
you get a closer look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do no proper patting or it'll
look really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like in the wrong place for the light
anyway so I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It usually has to be like natural sun or
something before I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lens is so big it just comes in
shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit more coming out
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lovely color.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lines on the camera look like the
plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The lines on the screen to like the center
of the border that looks like the rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it's still coming out really
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it from this angle,
it looks really orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going full drap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what we got this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell right away, look at how
light this is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the majority of what just came out
of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking killer yield, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you turn this press up more?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just folded it in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I left it in there for
long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it, a gram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the first press was a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you turn it back and press
this again and get more.
[SPEAKER_03]: From five grams?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this is going to be a high yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much was it already?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one, two?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly one gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally exactly one gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be like one five at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the texture on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh jeez.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to come hit this?
[SPEAKER_03]: The wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a nice color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that nice triggering right there
on that inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cake batter.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one scoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: With all the cake in the middle like,
oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll lift that up for one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to look at this batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your hand behind it real close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can move it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's locked onto the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your shirt's a better background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize it right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
Bloop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little tiny gap in the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the good microwave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's going to be low temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet skunk, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three rips for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to taste that sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that stuff at?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hid it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Panning too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running.
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole mouth is just like sweet skunked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so this is the sweet skunk going
in again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last of the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to just do a much
longer press on the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might have just thought it was
a higher quality than it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you were like, I don't want to
smash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I think you can smash this
like a little harder than you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it seemed like a fluffier,
you know, compared to that, when you grab
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you can feel the oil in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even like this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see more oil in it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still like talcum powder compared to
what that'll feel like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open the bag and feel that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll feel like brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one you can actually see like
frosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just self-pressed into clumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see what that one
comes out like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely what you want to see like
when you can actually form a little hash
[SPEAKER_01]: ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit there like Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, let's see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put this whole thing in the
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just with parchment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know someone's done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, why didn't this work, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that what a leave-in research does?
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard they don't use a screen and it's
just like a quarter pound block of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like personally know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know their unit's a direct flip draw.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Roz and we see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see it coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you make a backpack version where I
could just have this in my backpack so
[SPEAKER_03]: when I'm hiking if I want to just stop and
pull out my power team SPX hand pump,
[SPEAKER_03]: my Sasquatch M1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it all together just like on the
drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a little battery pack on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, do you want to smash some butts,
Flav?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of ridiculous, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of your mottos should be this
is not your girlfriend's hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I was saying that from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be on our shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now someone's gonna steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Johnny Beasley press that it's
like too hot plate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of trying to support it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Track that open there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still do it as I can press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's just buttering up in the
fucking literally buttering up in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's baggering up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a little warmer would help.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think you're out of the
pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: In an hour time, it'll just go right to
butter sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hit it more?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was nothing that adds a
little more in the jetty baking product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're hitting the Terp sugar,
the Tony made from Blue River.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to record it while everyone
was enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a master dish I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted exactly like my Jack Frost dabs
when I dabbed in the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just put it in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you're fucking eating candy at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Candy Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super delicious, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Frost Terp sugar for the win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we put in the 73, this was
Green Crack God, and it was the more oily
[SPEAKER_03]: resinous of the few sizes that we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be it for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it's squished out pretty fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely squished out caramel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super low temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only spot here is just so good with
the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you press that at like 220,
it would come out, or like 210,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would come out fully in like ooze,
but that was like the no bubble tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're trying to preserve,
I guess, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see how I'm having to double press
these things, and it takes like six
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes to press.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ripping parchment over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking parchment ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking bong ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bong ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bong ripper, parchment ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic tripper.
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
