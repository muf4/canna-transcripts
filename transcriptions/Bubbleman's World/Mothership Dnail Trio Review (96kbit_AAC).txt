[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to the Mothership Review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably going to do, in the future,
potentially a review on each piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I thought I got all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking me the differences
between this one and that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I were to do this one, the Taurus,
I might end up comparing it to the Egg in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way and then comparing it to the
Stray Kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I would just do a quick
little review here for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have two D-nails, a Dabinator and a
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third one is not plugged in right now,
but what I figured is we would try the
[SPEAKER_00]: titanium, the silicone carbide,
and the quartz and give them sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: test, and what I could do is hit the
Taurus first, hit the Stray Fab second,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hit this one last, and simply unplug
this particular whip and plug in this
[SPEAKER_00]: whip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using this unit for two nails,
so we'll probably be a little bit bound by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that it takes to heat that up,
which isn't so bad if you know the D-nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the 2.0, which is the unit
that we're working here with today,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the Dabinator from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a customized titanium nail that
D-nail was working on a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure they still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks off in the middle, sort of has a
round dish for collecting clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the I-Dab drop-down, got the Kori
cotton drop-down, the Rasta colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Flav, for that kick-down,
and this is on the silicone carbide hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be using the sapphire
today, but I figured we would try all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes with sort of a different bowl in
each one, and how I'm going to test them
[SPEAKER_00]: is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit each one with the quartz,
and then I'm going to heat each one with
[SPEAKER_00]: the titanium, and then I'm going to heat
each one with the silicone, and we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: what the differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn this phone off because
that will be some endless interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all sorts of D420K SIFT in the
house today for doing dabs, so I figured
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd start with a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we will start with... Let's start
with titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of figure that titanium to quartz
to silicone are sort of the ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find the silicone carbide preserves
terpenes just a little bit more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off over here with the big
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a big, tall, straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be close to a foot tall,
if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There goes my dab rag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have used something a little more
sturdy to keep that from blowing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit of a windy day,
which is kind of good that I'm not testing
[SPEAKER_00]: out lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm testing out motherships with D-Dins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go for a dunk on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little bit of a grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hit off titanium as much,
and I haven't been hitting out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight fab as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of room for air.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite different from the fab egg and the
Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite, quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say out of the three, this one
hits the most open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The least restricted, and of course the
titanium, to me, made the hit just a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably could have turned the nail down
and gone to 600 and something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that a little clean out, which is real
easy to do and makes it for nicer next
[SPEAKER_00]: hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scratch it out, and always close your eyes
when you're blowing any type of the
[SPEAKER_00]: residual out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff gets very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those of you that know, that watch
the videos, I got a little piece of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: my eye on my last trip to Jamaica,
and it stung like the dickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was the titanium
through the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, I kind of want to be able to do this
full review, but nine big dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess I'm in for the long haul
here, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this guy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hot, but we'll lean that down
nice and carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try the same nail, the same heat
source through a different pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little bit of a
smaller rip because that one was seemingly
[SPEAKER_00]: endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now we're going to hit the
straight fab, or sorry, the Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hit the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat, it's a much lighter
piece in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little bit more well-balanced
just because it's smaller and round.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base alone on this one is monstrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the biggest mothership base I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite big.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just fits a little nicer in the
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the Taurus, I would still
consider this a big pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compared to the straight fab,
it's kind of in the medium, in the medium
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's drop another dab onto there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I
[SPEAKER_00]: can say right off the bat that there was
more of an intense flavor in the fab egg
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting OG Kush, made from bud,
turned into dry sift, so it's literally an
[SPEAKER_00]: unadulterated cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure that guy's going,
yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an unadulterated cannabinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, I can really taste the
subtle differences from this piece to this
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even hit off the same nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filtration on this one, the way it
filtered the smoke compared to this one is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different structures, different
makeups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really tasted a flavor
enhancement on the fab egg from the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also found the hit was almost more
evenly distributed in the Faberge egg than
[SPEAKER_00]: the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the straight fab really reminded
me of that old school kind of meets new
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a tube, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that Swiss perk sort of action in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the laser perforated flower of
like life disc perk is also adding to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate Dizzle, who does the Swiss perks,
he does a sort of a frit, fritted holes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he's still doing that,
but when I first met him, he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, I'm certain that Nate Dizzle
and his Swiss perk design was
[SPEAKER_00]: inspirational in these designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on, shout out to Nate Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never stop using my Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a little hit of the lemonade and then
we're gonna move on to the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move on to the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this little guy is,
he's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so yeah, just same heat source
once again through the different pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Taurus, if you haven't ever hit
one, a lot of people say it's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't hit them all personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely hit a Klein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely hit a ball rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe I have hit them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't owned them all and I haven't
got to know them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't really say for the Klein or
the ball rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can speak for the three that I own,
even though I've only had the Taurus for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get this down and find a little
rip with that D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a nice hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really tempted to hit a different
flavor, but this review is really going
[SPEAKER_00]: through, I wanna discuss the flavor
enhancements, the flavor differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the three perks, I mean, of course I
can give you my personal opinions on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel in the hands and how I like them
for, you know, sight to how they look and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they photograph, how they hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also wanted to majorly talk about how
they affect flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hitting the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're going, you know,
rather than have each one with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: source, you can really change the flavor
from titanium to quartz to silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: carbide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what better way to try it than all
titanium, all quartz, then all silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: carbide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we go for our last hit with the
Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know the difference from the
straight fab and the fab bag in about one
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carb cap literally locks into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna start, stop your coughing while
you're removing the drop down from one
[SPEAKER_00]: piece and about to drop it into another
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a good idea to halt on the,
because you don't wanna be chipping glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell ya, the Taurus, okay,
I'll say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, it feels like a fab egg
that's been silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally, if you put a silencer on
a gun, that is the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's restricted, but restricted in the
strangest of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is Scott's version,
Scott Deppie's version of the Recycler,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just recycles so perfectly and
beautifully that it creates a restriction
[SPEAKER_00]: that just, to me, seems like a silencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taurus is the mothership's silencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could literally give someone a monster
rip with this piece and they may not know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you feel the chubble and the
chuggle of this piece and you watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke come up through the tube and into
the stem, you're pretty much sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be getting a really monstrous
rip, whereas with this little guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: these little mini Tauruses, you know,
eight to nine inches tall, with the Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: of Life disc perk in the bottom and the
Recycler in the top, it's just really a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool little pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess next up we will try the
deep dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for the deep dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Careful now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that back over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go deep dish, start with this guy.
All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, let me get this guy put away for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got mad pipes going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's grounded and it only goes in a
certain amount of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little confused thinking that it
was sticking out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's change up the flavor
profile this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go for a little bit of the Great
Gardener's newest creation, the CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a canatonic cross with Rene and it
of course created his CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: He won the Cannabis Cup this year for
highest CBD content of any entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's to you, Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has such a great flavor that the
minute you finish hitting it, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is that tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild and it's not Rene tasty because
you would assume when you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, the Rene CBD, it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would assume right away if you knew
Rene, but it was going to be tasty because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it very well may be because of the
Rene, but the profile is substantially
[SPEAKER_00]: different from the actual Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this back over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be so, so careful with these
mother ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to be thinking as you're
moving them around, especially I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: one rip after the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moving them all back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably all watching like,
oh, bubble man, don't give me a heart
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try not to give me a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of more, more lemonade ought
to, ought to relax both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Faberge egg, CBD Rene, Faberge egg,
deep dish banger quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
difference between the quartz right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I felt like the quartz hit was
substantially cooler in the sense that it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't sharpen my throat and it felt more
preserved in the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously I didn't hit the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit a very different strain,
but I know them both very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in my stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke them daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked them off of a multitude of,
uh, of heat sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can say with, with a surety that the
titanium and these are all at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to basically do all these
things at the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's within, uh, you know, even if it's
10 or 20 degrees, the real difference is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how the substance holds heat and
releases heat, how the terpene profile is
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved or destroyed when it comes in
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one tasted very, very on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor profile on this one is a much
stronger flavor profile, not as subtle as
[SPEAKER_00]: the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have to say this, the egg and
the straight fab had a similar taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real difference was in the,
um, in the restriction that the fab egg
[SPEAKER_00]: offers and also the equal, I don't even
know how to describe it, just the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: water comes up through the piece equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: On all four sides, if you've ever seen a
fab egg, it's two pieces of an egg that
[SPEAKER_00]: are attached by four points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's these rectangular slits
that go around the center of the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really splits the egg from the
top to the, to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, obviously there's a ton of
hype on the eggs and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I really like mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a really nice piece of glass
and I feel that it's right on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these pieces with being
well-deserved of hitting the hashes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the hashes that I'm often
hitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mad shout out to Matt, the great
gardener before 20 K John Burfellow
[SPEAKER_00]: Horatio Delbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all good friends that have
learned these processes, uh, adapted them,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, enhance them and are now making
beautiful products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on guys, I guess, uh,
one more hit of the CBD Renee and this
[SPEAKER_00]: time we're going to do it out of the
Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to this one because this
Taurus generally, you know, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much accurate that most of the things I've
hit out of it have had an increased taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that more preserved terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most flavorful of the three
hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rip was, I tasted it deeper in my
throat and even though I just took that
[SPEAKER_00]: sip of lemonade and it's a very strong
lemonade, I can still taste the powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors of that CBD Renee right on my lips
and even down my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That out of all three of those rips is the
rip that I want to go back for Taurus
[SPEAKER_00]: quartz club deep dish banger, two thumbs
up from the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what we'll do now is we'll do a
quick switch on our nails, plug in our
[SPEAKER_00]: silicone carbide, get him into the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually we'll get him over into,
I'll, I'll keep my order like the order
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll start with the straight fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the silicone carbide nail is a new nail
that D now has come out with recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it's available yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out D dash nail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the bubble man 10 code for your
discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's available, it's a hybrid with a
titanium base and they're now making a
[SPEAKER_00]: small shelf that screws into the top to
the bottom of the nail and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put a sapphire dish right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nice combo I haven't yet hit
and we'll talk about that in another
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're going to hit the silicone
carbide hybrid with the titanium base
[SPEAKER_00]: through the dropdown, through all three of
the motherships, the straight fab,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Faberge egg and the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've already hit the titanium and
we've already hit the quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit, I'm six rips in right now,
three OG full melt dry sifts and three
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt dry sift Renee CBDs from the
great Gardner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other dry sips from D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to finish it off with a
little Horatio Delbur seven star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a little seven star and it's
from my little pony, if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little my little pony seven star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do our
carbide nail with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice big chunk that I'm going
to break into three here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, what better way to honor my good
buddies than, you know, smoke some of
[SPEAKER_00]: their beautiful hash that they were so
kind to leave with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never shy away from a hash gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, that's the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gift of gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing to give some of your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some seven star broken into
some rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our nail at about 600 degrees
Fahrenheit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the sun going down right behind
us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another epic day in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leaving tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on a plane flight at
Toronto and then I'm going to get off that
[SPEAKER_00]: plane, jump on another plane and I'm going
to be in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jamaica is really exciting this next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show you the nutraceutical
conference announcement that's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: to announce that industry in Jamaica in
Kingston on the 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to be heading to Negril
for the 7th and the 8th for the Stepping
[SPEAKER_00]: High Festival, which is a 13th annual now,
cannabis cup type celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Ras Bobby, Bobby Dredd from Aya
Media is putting that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to go down there
and do some judging, speak on the panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: meet some amazing ganja farmers and just
have an amazing time all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we literally have to zip back
to Kingston on the 8th, halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, and there's going to be a soccer
game, celebrity soccer game with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingston artists versus the St. Catherine
artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard Beanie Man and Kronix and some
other well-known artists are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: donning the jerseys and playing the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've sponsored that through UCAN
CRD, Cannabinoid Research and Development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want to be present for that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course I'll have the camera there
and I'll bring you guys all along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with a little 7-star,
Horatio Delbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable terpene content right off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A heavy terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still learning the recipes of how much to
put in and I bet you will end up putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in much less in the future, but wow,
is that terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really nicely terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, I mean almost more terpene than
the My Little Pony has ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that was his whole purpose,
you know, recapturing those terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: had been lost in the drying process,
potentially lost in the water extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process of water-soluble terpenes being
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the silicone carbide nail with the
7-star, top-notch, even through the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight fab, which is for me,
I say that because it's very big and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a very open space and I'm thinking more
and more as I go through the mother ships
[SPEAKER_00]: and I learn about what piece I'm going to
love, I'm digging these smaller and more
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still a great piece, but probably about
as big as I'll ever go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so next up, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fab bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is almost a test in itself to
just be moving around this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little slow dab there, still smoking a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so another 7-star dab,
this time through, this time through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you one thing that's that
terp melt does right off the bat is,
[SPEAKER_00]: or terpsift, sorry, or 7-star,
it just goes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes seem to enhance it the same
way a hash in a joint makes it burn
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep getting rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not putting any more in than I put in
the other stuff and it just keeps going
[SPEAKER_00]: and going and going and that's just a nice
treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted pretty damn good through the
Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, main differences, a deeper
trouble in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a, I don't even know how
to explain it, it's a louder, but this one
[SPEAKER_00]: is deeper and almost a little more
silenced from this version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll use that term compared to the
Taurus, which is an even more silenced
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the Fabeg, which we're going to
get to right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this guy's all turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well just get him out of the way.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, some of you are probably
saying, damn, bubble man just took down
[SPEAKER_00]: like nine rips of full melt trisift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to do my ninth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, this pan a little
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the dish seems to be more stained
with the wetness of a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the hash itself is completely
dry, like completely dry, here we go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Taurus and the final end hit of my
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's tasty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, deep, deep in the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taurus has this restriction on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of pulling harder, but by the
time you exhale your hit, you realize
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some sort of preservation going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taurus, the Faberge egg, and the
straight fab, all three with titanium
[SPEAKER_00]: nail, deep dish bucket quartz from Puking
Beagle and the good folks at D Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the silicone carbide
titanium hybrid nail in the Corey
[SPEAKER_00]: Cottenham drop down and the Taurus from
Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everyone that was involved
in making these products from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabinator to the D Nail, deep dish banger,
Puking Beagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Gardener, D420K, Horatio Delbert,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, just because they're sitting on my
table right here, Unity and the Community
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oil Slick for producing these cool
little products that I'm able to put these
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes on and not worry about the base of
them chipping on me.
