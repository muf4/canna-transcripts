[SPEAKER_03]: So I just got here to the grounds where
the roots rest the Faray Fest and the High
[SPEAKER_03]: Times Cannabis Cup is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Nyabingi drummers going on over
here and we got to get some of this on the
[SPEAKER_03]: camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up man?
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Nyabingi drummers going on.

[SPEAKER_08]: I am Nyabingi drummers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am Nyabingi drummers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am nyabingi drummers.
I am Nyabingi drummers.
So love the words I'm writing out,
I'm just waiting, hey, Shana, bye-bye.
Be our safe haven, and we'll be safe
around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, mama.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's imperial majesty, Emperor Hylas,
the last of the first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we say, princes and princesses must
shut out of Babylon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ethiopians, now, stretch forth your hands
into Jaffa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Ayanai Jaffa, Ethiopia, Ayanai divine
majesty, thy arid coming to Ayanai to
[SPEAKER_05]: build in the parts of righteousness,
lead Ayanai.
[SPEAKER_05]: Help Ayanai to forgive that Ayanai must be
forgiven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Teach Ayanai love, loyalty, and hurt as it
is in downside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the humble be fed to make it through,
to acknowledge the edge protected and the
[SPEAKER_05]: infants cared for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deliver Ayanai from the hands of our
enemies, that Ayanai must prove fruitful
[SPEAKER_05]: in these perilous days.
[SPEAKER_05]: When our enemies are passed from the king,
we can get some peace in the depths of the
[SPEAKER_05]: earth and in the belly of a beast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, give Ayanai a place in Ayanai's living
kingdom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the eye of the king of kings and
the love of lords, the concurrent life of
[SPEAKER_05]: the tribe of Judah, with the legs of
himself and the life of this world,
[SPEAKER_05]: Ayanai will divine majesty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Emperor Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Emperor Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Emperor Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Hylas!
[SPEAKER_08]: Hylas!
[SPEAKER_05]: Selah and Selah, Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, a nice thanks to everyone here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of you might be experiencing
this for the first time, but this is
[SPEAKER_06]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and we said death to black and
white, don't press us.
[SPEAKER_06]: See?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, put your hands together for Sister
Nitsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the person that will take over the
sermon from here and introduce the
[SPEAKER_06]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, put your hands together for Sister
Nitsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, she has been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: She has been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: She has been a stalwart amongst the N.I.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on through all types of tribulation
and persecution because you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: history that Rastafari has gone through in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if Sister Nitsy is not here,
I'm going to ask for her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Sister Nitsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sister Nitsy, Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give thanks to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks to my Rastafari family who
brought such a beautiful welcome to this
[SPEAKER_00]: occasion and I welcome you warmly as
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing and witnessing here is
our daily lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any home, in Jamaica, you can go and
experience this on a daily basis because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how we share our meditation with
our father, his imperial majesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we say welcome again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Rastafari Roots Fest and we're
hosting the High Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met some new friends today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fern, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have a very special,
we have to say brother because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers within humanities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are brothers and sisters and this is
somebody who has developed a very close
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't agree on everything but we know
that this is a journey as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, ganja is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we have paid the
price for as Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have suffered a lot of persecution,
marginalization, tribulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are now experiencing a moment of
celebration towards greater liberation and
[SPEAKER_00]: we say give thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for all the ones amongst us from every
nation, race and creed who has been a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the advocacy for the liberation of this
plant that we know as the healing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation, we say one more applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say give thanks again especially to
our elders of the Rastafari community who
[SPEAKER_00]: as we said have made so much sacrifice and
have paid the price for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't ever forget them whether they are
in their ancestral realm or they are still
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at this time I want to welcome on
stage to share a few words with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who has, you know, started opening
the gates, who has helped to relax things
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit for us and to help us as
Rastafari to feel a little bit more at
[SPEAKER_00]: ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're still adjourning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still in front of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just take some higher steps from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this occasion we're going to be
moving forward very, very positively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to welcome without further ado
the Minister of Justice himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Mark Golding, to come and share a
few words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Sister Mitzi.
[SPEAKER_01]: All other distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen who are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say how much of an honor it
is for me to be standing here before you
[SPEAKER_01]: this afternoon in beautiful Negro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really have a fantastic venue here for
this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God is blessing us, Jai is blessing us
with a nice gentle rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we in Jamaica forgive time so rain
because we don't always have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we get it, we really appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic
occasion for us here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first such event to be put on
in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: In April of this year, the Parliament here
passed a law which made a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to the way in which ganja is
treated in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did a number of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into the details of
that at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe on another occasion during the
festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one important thing living and
living at one with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all of us, I think, should take
advantage of the opportunities to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more about this religion, about the
spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we leave here, eventually,
we will, I think, have a much more fulsome
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been an opportunity for High
Times Magazine to partner with the
[SPEAKER_01]: organizers of this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross ILV is the conceptualized and main
driving force behind this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rastafari in unity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with his team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to big up the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up Ross ILV for having brought this
thing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank High Times for partnering
with the Jamaican Rastafari community to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the Jamaican High Times Cannabis Cup
in the Rastafari Roots Festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, of course, has been the catalyst
that has brought many people from outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of Jamaica to come to Negril to experience
this unique festival, one of a kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be like any other that has
gone before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my hope that this festival will help
to provide economic opportunities for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And will grow from strength to strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see this to be an event
that is enjoyed by all with mutual respect
[SPEAKER_01]: and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we leave here feeling uplifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we leave here looking forward to this
event being repeated again in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And becoming something that is very,
very meaningful for Jamaica and its
[SPEAKER_01]: economy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going
to talk for any longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank you all for being
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I urge you all to enjoy what we have
to offer here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really my sister, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really my sister.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how we look alike?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was about to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, again, I'd like to give thanks and
greetings as usual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, in the name of His Majesty,
the Celestial.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the name of Her Highness, Empress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Empress, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really a pleasure for me,
man, to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Sister Nitchie said, yes,
I have been there on the forefront.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this could not have been done without
individuals like Sister Nitchie,
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus Goff, Ross Ivey, Bunga Joe,
you name the team.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it could not have been done again
without the Honorable Mark Whalley.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give thanks for Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give thanks to Cathy because
after we started this in Westmoreland,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a domino reaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And parishes all over, groups came up all
over because they realized that with the
[SPEAKER_06]: amendment between the laws as it regards
to herb, ganja, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_06]: it opened the door for people,
foreign investors and other people to come
[SPEAKER_06]: into Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do not have any problem with
investors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we have a problem, I do not want to
see this industry being manipulated by
[SPEAKER_06]: people with money, foreign investors or
local Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are certain people, Rastafarian
grassroot people who have gone to prison,
[SPEAKER_06]: who have paid a heavy price to keep this
industry alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there is money to be made out of
this industry, I am saying that these
[SPEAKER_06]: people should also benefit economically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, while we are here, I hope that
we learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: We already have Utech, we have UE,
we have the DSJ that will be coming
[SPEAKER_06]: through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of different agencies and
entities, governmental and otherwise,
[SPEAKER_06]: that will be coming through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the human objective is to really make
this like I said before, into a real
[SPEAKER_06]: education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning in different ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, why I took this stand as a youth?
[SPEAKER_06]: As a youth growing up, I am from a
grassroot background, working class
[SPEAKER_06]: background.
[SPEAKER_06]: And being a youth who had the privilege,
I got a common entrance examination at the
[SPEAKER_06]: age of 11 plus, at the end of my life,
to go to Manning High School, the second
[SPEAKER_06]: oldest educational institution in the
island.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as such, it has helped I to develop my
educational ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as a youth, I never feel satisfied
watching police coming amongst my
[SPEAKER_06]: grassroot people, my working class people,
and harassing them in any way whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the fact that I had the educational
ability, I took it as a pleasure to
[SPEAKER_06]: confront police, to confront the
government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as such, like Sister Mitchell said,
we have arranged marches, marches upon
[SPEAKER_06]: marches, letters upon letters,
until today, give thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here, we can bring, we can travel
with herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get permit that we can go and pick up
herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can travel with even 10 pound of herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, those who have the permit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I have to give thanks for the
work of the Honorable Mark Golding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember we had written to a prime
minister seeking an audience with him to
[SPEAKER_06]: discuss the issue of marijuana,
the educational system, the issue of
[SPEAKER_06]: reparation and repatriation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We never got an audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Honorable Mark Golding is a man like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like anytime you call him, he's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way this minister is not there is
if he cannot be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you're a leader, you must be
prepared to sit with your people and talk
[SPEAKER_06]: with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: A house is never built from the top go
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always built from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people of this country,
descendants of enslaved African people,
[SPEAKER_06]: we know what it is to suffer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The chains run on our hands and our feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: The chains have been moved.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been placed psychologically,
but more so it has been placed
[SPEAKER_06]: economically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even when we liberate ourselves
mentally, like Bob sing the song,
[SPEAKER_06]: emancipate yourself from mental slavery,
nothing but ourselves can change our mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with that, we still have the economic
situation to face.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an opportunity that we can
utilize this product to help uplift the
[SPEAKER_06]: economic condition of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that the United States is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are there with a big stick over
our head.
[SPEAKER_06]: For years they have sent helicopters come
to Jamaica to cut down the marijuana that
[SPEAKER_06]: was grown here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been sprayed with chemicals such as
paraquat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the USF is doing what?
[SPEAKER_06]: More than half the states have now
legalized and decriminalized ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only for medical uses, but also for
recreational uses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's very hypocritical of
the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we cannot do what we think is right,
and if we cannot be allowed to plant
[SPEAKER_06]: herbs, to utilize it medically and
economically, then the United States of
[SPEAKER_06]: America should not be allowed to do that
either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the United States of America is doing
that because they realize the medicinal
[SPEAKER_06]: potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the economic potential of herbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we as black people and as a
nation in Jamaica should also be allowed
[SPEAKER_06]: to use marijuana to develop our economy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a fact that for years research and
research has been carried out,
[SPEAKER_06]: not only in the United States,
but other places of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I used to tell them that Africa
is the cradle of mankind and the cradle of
[SPEAKER_06]: civilization, we were lost, we were
mocked, we were scorned.
[SPEAKER_06]: But today it has all been proven.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the rest of man was right in saying
those things, it will be proven that the
[SPEAKER_06]: rest of man is right in everything that he
says.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope to use this avenue, we hope to use
this space, again to educate our people
[SPEAKER_06]: about his imperial majesty, Eilatulasi,
about the empress, empress Badirah Menen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just celebrated the 85th anniversary of
the coronation of his majesty and her
[SPEAKER_06]: majesty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want our people to realize that we
do have a base, a historical,
[SPEAKER_06]: archaeological, anthropological,
archaeological, you name it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any alley that you go down, the rest of
man is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again I say give thanks to the
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope that you will learn a lot and that
when you leave here, you'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look who I just bumped into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony V is in the house here at the Jamaica
Cannabis Cup Roots Rastafari Festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 36 hours of traveling through ice
storms and floods.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not bad.
Not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the exact same time that it took to
get answered on a contest for on a beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got here before my product,
which I said nine days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have a quick dab here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some of this stuff that you
might have saw on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just the white turplas and butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got bigger ones at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to stand there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the corner even so she's not
affecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whooping up the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some lemon pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little lemon pie turpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon pie turpene right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 to 40 drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I wish you guys had Smell-O-Vision for
this, but you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like, you'll just have to
trust me on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Wrangles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have two gifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon pie and gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now those are the gifts that keep on
giving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon pie and gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been raining here most of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did catch a little bit of the ceremony
of the Rastafari, chanting and singing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drumming as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to say, Tony B is in the house
with the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know people talk about turps and I've
smelled a variety of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to say that Tony's definitely
doing something very unique in the sense
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're bang on to the strain that
they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you smell them if you know the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will say what the gentleman from
Devil's Harvest Seeds just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is bang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smell the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, I got a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my Lindsay O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just no turps today.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good lemon though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got state flesh.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what we'll try next.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause that's the best shit I possibly
have.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't even need to add anything to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why it's called turps raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can have this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a carve at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's not really the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to I dab for sending that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I broke it very early when it fell over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, there's tons of spiders on this
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like four or five little dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No lineups, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No lineups?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, give thanks to the Tweet guys for
letting us hang out in their booth right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And share the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in Amsterdam two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started with these excessive turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should check out some of these turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never smelled anything like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me get him one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a line up of turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little bit better to smell than
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a pause button.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll show this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let it run.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bang on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool because especially in the
diesels.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the best way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember folk music?
[SPEAKER_13]: And then someone came around with a
grunge, tube amp, electric guitar,
[SPEAKER_13]: and turned it all the way around.
[SPEAKER_13]: And his name was Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way to explain music.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the best way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just went.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it does to the response.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a modulator.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was goal one.
[SPEAKER_03]: 36 hours hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more left to rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: 36 hours, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it took my stuff nine days so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is going in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a natural dab, not a beehive dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not made with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the ITAL version of the dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: ITAL dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just tiny little pieces exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, what you do to this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a little chaser I've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The medicine man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different with yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quartz.
[SPEAKER_03]: My halo shattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The taste on that was so fucking
ridiculous.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terp flavor all around the lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: My trip just got better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having a bad day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a bit of a bad day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Tony Terpien rolled through and he
modulated my entire day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_13]: Smell that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can feel it from here, it's pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're smoking rosin and bubble
hash.
How do you even do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started, it was about a half an
hour and 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the reality.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was like, OK, that's my quantity.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does it taste like?
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it rough on my eyes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think the effect is
drastically?
[SPEAKER_10]: The trick is you go to an A, and then you
try an OG smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well this is going to go on for
an hour, so I'm going to take a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to be speaking really
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get back to you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this table, we have Tony Terpien
above the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird Eye's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird Eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the grill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at the Roots Rastafari Festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, so many hash churches.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were waiting for this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here, we got someone selling herbs at
this table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go on the herbalist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, the herbalist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Going in on those terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you put a giant dab of terps on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a whole, yeah, that's a lot,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps would have been fun back in the day
to prank straight people with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just like dump some terps on some
straight people, and then like watch them
[SPEAKER_03]: get pulled over and harassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Terpien.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it won't be going in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it won't be going in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because that's like a $3,000 pipe
with an electric nail in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a Chinese, you know,
they're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll taste like a million bucks through
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, through that, everyone gets to hit
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it goes in there, he just gets to hit
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you've got to make it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we teach people, you've got to
make your home.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the pipe, look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Tony doesn't drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was feeling your pain there,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's true, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll definitely let you hit it out of
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to follow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to hit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you're talking to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Peter Tosh, this guy you're talking
about in the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not saying that to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not saying that to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not saying that to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to taste this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't want to taste that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got me a pen, so I need a supply to
go with my pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can do for you is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make some hash tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you some hash to put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go make some hash tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I came over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to follow up this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all his.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm bigger than this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to follow up this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're bigger than this,
but you really should try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in person, so don't read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I have a deep respect for Peter
Tosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably in a way that he could really
never understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that because you just expressed it
in the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hung out with his mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Tosh passed away on her stoop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I puffed him down back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I puffed him down in bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went to there and gave him some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even named my firstborn son Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a deep respect for Peter Tosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get that wrong, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take it to heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take it to heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can feel it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're my truths.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all we do, the full time we're here,
is we will give away every claim we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't take anything or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just here to give.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your journey, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel my respect at that corner in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you all the best in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the festival is over,
will you be coming to the band,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be looking out for you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tophis, they call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tophis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blessed and wicked.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Steve.
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the first bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow I'll come and say, get Ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight I'll make it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's ready for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: How we doing, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been talking about Cache Church for
about a year.
Yeah, that's kind of where I feel like we
need to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cache Church panelist, Tony Verzura,
turpin' out Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpin' them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so Tony is still here hitting
people up with turpines.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the turpines, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty impressive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: See that every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like five turpines with three
types of full mounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just soapy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So greasy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greasy, greasy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that greasy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like you guys aren't really
pulling.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting a real hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw him, I tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a turp party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turp party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Frost, Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Frost, Golden Goat, Lemon Pie.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about the icy plane.
[SPEAKER_12]: The icy plane.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the captain though, here's what he did.
[SPEAKER_12]: He goes, so we're finally going to get
taken off over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you only have a couple options.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're definitely going to be late.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he puts out this app application for
your phone so you can download this app.
[SPEAKER_12]: Greasy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get this app and you're supposed to
look at other flights so it can help you
[SPEAKER_12]: book it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, we're sorry this app isn't
working.
[SPEAKER_12]: And everyone's holding up their phones.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like mad chaos going on in the
plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bathrooms are plugged and there'll
be no movies on the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had this really good seat all the
way to the far right where there was an
[SPEAKER_12]: exit row seat and there was no seat for
me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was stretched out like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the guy next to me was like.
[SPEAKER_12]: Had the door?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he was like right here next to me this
way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my legs were perfectly stretched out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was like a good hour just with no
AC and everybody so agitated.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like the third de-icing on the plane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like we can hold the power.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're ready to take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go have a turp party.
[SPEAKER_12]: Turp party.
[SPEAKER_12]: Turp party.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been forgetting to turn the camera
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am here now at the boardwalk of
Village.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Kyle Fischman, who's talking to Tony,
was married today a little after 4.20 on
[SPEAKER_03]: the beach in Negril at the Ruta Rastafari
High Times Canada Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're here now celebrating the after
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Suzy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Suzy's on the other side of the table
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hanging out with Bird Eye,
Cam, Austin, and Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new dude with some rosies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tardly bow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you turped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who here is willing to do a shot with me
for my wedding?
[SPEAKER_07]: Me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab a shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get to tell you earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's taking shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't take shots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to film this.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, who's missing one?
Come on, there's one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so this is a most auspicious
occasion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am so, so proud and thankful to be
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Experiencing history with all of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first cannabis cup in Amsterdam was
certainly fun, and it was momentous,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was historic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is real life.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is changing people's lives right
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're all a part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we've all been dreaming of
and fighting for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to get married here with my
love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got to take part in that wonderful
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're here with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're here with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to thank you all and say
that this is for everlasting friendship
[SPEAKER_07]: and what legalization of cannabis is going
to do for humankind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mazel tov.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, bam, boom, bam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always loved you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so good to hang out with you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've loved you since the moment I met you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kelly P on the chalice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He let you put those drops in his mouth at
Bob Marley's house, so I'm sure he's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to fall off nice or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be going for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will keep you from sucking too much
oxygen in and give you a nice carved hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have to say about the flavor
on that bird eye?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real deal right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always hitting this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have had my camera on pause that
whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good conversations going on over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Susie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the crew right there is the best man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Cameron and Austin and Kyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Junior Jr., JR, Kelly P. Bird eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a collaboration in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm legal in Cali and all over,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's my card.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's not your medicine card.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a federal requires.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice catch on the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it running?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slow and steady on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll melt real slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to drop it in there and then
we'll cover it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want them to get the full flavor
of all of it melting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smell it now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It smells very islandy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells kind of like green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to hold that, Tony?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could probably turn that up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: $5.93.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a super slow terpy hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at Kyle.
[SPEAKER_10]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so embarrassed.
I'm so embarrassed.
It's going to be a super slow terpy hit.
