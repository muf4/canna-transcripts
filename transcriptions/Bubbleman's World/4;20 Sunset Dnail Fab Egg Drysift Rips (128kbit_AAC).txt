[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and Welcome to the house sound and Sun is
[SPEAKER_00]: going down and it was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I want to share it with with my
YouTube family so Up goes the phone in
[SPEAKER_00]: goes the case I ran around a little bit
like a maniac trying to catch it before
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sun went down but I thought what I
would do is For those of you that follow
[SPEAKER_00]: me on Facebook at bubble man You saw that
I was cleaning some dry sift today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my Little bit of dry sift here
three little varieties there People were
[SPEAKER_00]: asking what's what these are two both from
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean this contaminant out of this This
is really nice and melty and it's a hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant This one over here was a little bit
of barb that I had left not not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: barb But a long I think it was a one-hour
spin So I cleaned a tiny little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that as well and it's mostly pure
heads There might be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hair or some contaminant here and there if
I get under it with the sun scope,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all in all Quite happy with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again as I've shown many times on
on bubble man's world You see this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift and you see that when I turn it
upside down That it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that That is stable powder and I
just put this on here I don't know maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple hours ago and of course what's most
impressive is that you can see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just powder as I scoop up a giant dab got
the egg right here and Well, why don't you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys grab a piece grab your rig and let's
do a little the Sun is setting rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I had my tip my head turned over so you
couldn't see but closed both my eyes that
[SPEAKER_00]: rip Really lovely enjoyable Such a great
time to be out in the house sound area
[SPEAKER_00]: every time at around This time as the
Sun's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like the water always calms
right down if it was a blustery day windy
[SPEAKER_00]: day the Waves kind of chill right out and
you can see it on the water that the waves
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite calm right now Got a helicopter
flying by here in a bit Maybe we better do
[SPEAKER_00]: a helicopter dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some of that barb this little big dab
of the barbola The Sun behind it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not nice So we get quite a bit of
helicopter traffic up here as I am on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to Whistler Anyone that's flying to
Whistler and a helicopter goes right past
[SPEAKER_00]: my house And then of course we have search
and rescue in the area seems to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow Helicopter is out more often than
we would like to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it Yeah, unfortunately people get lost in
the mountains up here all too often they
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the backcountry with The proper
gear they don't let people know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going into the backcountry these
are all things that when you live in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area like British Columbia It's very
important that you do these simple things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you leave a note or a phone call or a
message or tell someone directly where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're where you're going because you can
get hypnotized by the beauty and The
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with getting hypnotized by the
beauty is it can get deadly pretty darn
[SPEAKER_00]: fast So I wouldn't be surprised if the way
this helicopter is flying that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the yellow search and rescue
helicopter Well fingers crossed we did
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a girl on Whistler Mountain gone
for three days She went into the backside
[SPEAKER_00]: of a crystal chair down Blackcomb ended up
into the backcountry of the singing pass
[SPEAKER_00]: which is oboe cowboy and Eventually she
ended up on Wedge Mountain which was two
[SPEAKER_00]: whole mountain ranges over up on the way
to Pemberton so pretty scary very happy
[SPEAKER_00]: that she that that story ended the way it
did and The reason that story ended the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it did is because we haven't had a
winter We just have not been getting snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been getting precipitation
precipitation, but we've got such warm
[SPEAKER_00]: weather that it's It's just affecting some
of the winter fun as you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably seen my channel would have a lot
more snowmobiling and a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: snowboarding and ski flying and all these
things If the snow was up there for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy so And what a beautiful sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna take one more rip Go
back to the original that barb was really
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: How loud the barb is See what we got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we see that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinda Sundabs, maybe I'll use the Sun Can
I get in front of it there we go try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the Sun to heat the bowl All right,
