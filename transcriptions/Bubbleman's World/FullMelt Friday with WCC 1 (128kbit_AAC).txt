[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world for
a city Parking lot truck sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah with the West Coast concentrate boys
in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a delicious meal at Cardero's
Scooted into the underground parking lot
[SPEAKER_01]: here and of course like we always do when
we don't have a tour We couldn't get the D
[SPEAKER_01]: nail to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't even get their Chinese version
to work off of this little piece of shit
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 watt fucking inverter that I have
wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like, do we need to get a
torch?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Brett got out and walked around and he
was like I found A place that we can plug
[SPEAKER_01]: in that we can get get this shit done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here we are We're definitely on
camera under the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one literally right here Then
there's also another one right over there
[SPEAKER_01]: on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in well, we're in good I didn't
see that one camera view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're we just finished a great meal So
we're gonna smoke some beautiful hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to have a conversation
with these guys today about Hash making
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, a lot of people ask me all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you how do you become a good hash
maker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any advice for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought what better way than to have
a conversation with Adam and Brett They're
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly fresh new hash makers on the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been making hash for like
the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah last year and a beautiful job They've
been doing thanks to the West Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate crew Helping everyone out
along the way Phil doing a great job and
[SPEAKER_01]: passing on the knowledge that I shared
with him and I guess we've got the fab egg
[SPEAKER_01]: all ready to go with the Cory Cottenham
drop down and the Beagle Bowl We've
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's time to puff here
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some some GCG full spec and PC full
spec All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks quite nice quite lovely It's
amazing how nice it looks hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, like just in front of the camera
right there beautiful with us it here
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll lower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's Adam Great job, I don't mind
being blacked out by the hash I mean man I
[SPEAKER_01]: could push that right up against the lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just keeps looking better and better
and better So You can talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about how we got into making hash That'd
be perfect dude, cuz that's kind of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you guys from a perspective
of like fresh on the game Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it first off started with me
and Adam being inspired by seeing full
[SPEAKER_00]: mount resin that we couldn't purchase
Couldn't go out and buy so we decided we
[SPEAKER_00]: were gonna take it upon ourselves to try
and make it mind you that that was a Long
[SPEAKER_00]: road to where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean not long in time, but long long in
Actually practicing, you know and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of hash and it wouldn't be possible
without you know, the help of our
[SPEAKER_00]: Collective and our crew behind us course
because that really gave us opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know hone in on our skills guys like
Phil dropping knowledge coming in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: crew definitely helped and and your video
It was really got some water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's definitely water in there
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll hit this while you continue to
tell the story of how you guys got into
[SPEAKER_00]: this Yeah, so basically we just started
making hash for ourselves and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we met up with the West Coast collective
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed to like the hash and wanted to
offer our solventless product in their
[SPEAKER_00]: collective so we came in and Started doing
that for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started with rosin dry sift
When Phil came in he really helped us hone
[SPEAKER_00]: in on the bubble skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you see Some beautiful bubble like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah It's not it's not really a long
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically were inspired we went out and
try and did something we Accomplished it
[SPEAKER_00]: and we try and just redo that day after
day after day Well, I think it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: an inspiration for people to listen to
because they all want to be doing it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I mean really I think from my
perspective the tip I always give people
[SPEAKER_01]: is Is hone in on the best quality
possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that's where you want to pay
your attentions to yes If you find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that someone thinks is the bomb
but it's not You're kind of wasting your
[SPEAKER_01]: time in that sense of like why is my
product not melting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you know, why am I getting such shitty
yields?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I'm personally bummed when I run a
batch and it's just not yeah It's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're what you're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure or or when somebody you know the
whole Trash to stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're only going to get as good
as a good as melt as there You know the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that the resin comes from that's
it It's hard to turn real trash into six
[SPEAKER_00]: star full melt a lot of the time damn near
impossible It's damn it like you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the girl's hand when you're done
fire in fire out always What do we say
[SPEAKER_00]: fire in fire out?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing to
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some great tasty bubble,
of course I'll show some macro photographs
[SPEAKER_01]: so you guys can see this is the GSC the
God the green green crack green crack God,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the G C G I've been smoking enough of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I'd know the name by now Walking
around the parking lot looking for we
[SPEAKER_01]: should really show this real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good it's a good time
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you see that right on the
pillar this is how we do this is how we do
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So yeah, we've been trying to
film this sequence most of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met up earlier We had a little session
we went in eight and the day just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like did that not just disappear?
[SPEAKER_01]: We hung out for a few hours in a parking
lot just Smoking this truck out like beans
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could oh But it'll be loud Okay,
okay smoking it out So yeah, I think I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have one more little dab a doodle here
while we're try the other stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it the PC We're gonna do a little
Periscope after this too So I want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: this video short and sweet kind of the
inspirational video of like young fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: new hash makers That want to make their
mark, you know This is a video that I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to sort of answer a few
questions to people like that Which is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the information I guess when
you're someone that doesn't know how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: What information is real and what
information is not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah really R&D because there's so many
things out there and you may you may think
[SPEAKER_00]: something works and then you try it and
you You quickly come to the realization
[SPEAKER_00]: that it doesn't We all have those ideas
and you know after you make it for a year
[SPEAKER_00]: You start realizing what works what
doesn't in the end fire in fire out is the
[SPEAKER_01]: main Not to mention when you say something
like I've been making hash for a year That
[SPEAKER_01]: can mean a lot of different things
definitely depending on where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from like oh I made like three
batches in the last year That's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make like five to ten batches a day 365
days a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so those are two different sort of
Spectrums mind you I wouldn't say we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making hash ten batches a day 306 five
days a year But we definitely get to make
[SPEAKER_00]: hash every week If we aren't making hash,
we're making rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to understand more about the
plant we all love Awesome, really well
[SPEAKER_01]: right on guys and what when people ask me
locally, where can they pick up West Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate solventless?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the glass is gonna say the only place
you can get our solventless products right
[SPEAKER_02]: now is at THC It's on Main Street And
yeah, they're great guys in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just did a pick up of some of our
purple candy full spectrum It was a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice drop and I think the guys over there
grabbed a couple grams for themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely get that quick if not DM the
West Coast Collective Especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: an MMPR patient or have your dispensary
card in the lower mainland DM the West
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast Collective Collective with no E on
the end of it And then I guess another
[SPEAKER_01]: option is they can always just whip by the
CCHQ on Davie on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always there Wednesdays Yeah,
scope out the product there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come and see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have product for you to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free full mount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free full mount.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've been doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a wonderful experience Full
mount Fridays are in effect and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a wrap guys Obviously, we're gonna
do a periscope now, but let's say goodbye
[SPEAKER_01]: to these guys Cheers guys You You You
