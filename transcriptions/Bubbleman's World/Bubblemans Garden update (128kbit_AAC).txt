[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're gonna do another
little garden update here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in about week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watermelon's producing very nice nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice resin content on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have the Medi, Medi Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have, oh that's nice,
that Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the Chem 4 Reunion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under that Chem 4 Reunion you got a nice
big fat watermelon nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon being the astro boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some nice, nice nuggets
stacking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that other head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy here, this branch had a really
nice unique fat head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta stake that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we got the My Little Pony as well
here in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't really pushed out her resin
content yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not covered, covered, covered in
resin, but she sure has a real nice smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are now being flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably flush them for five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not longer, I'm not exactly sure of the
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really paying attention,
so it'll really be about what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably snap off a bud here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cure it out, dry it,
and dry sift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to see if the resin's melty and
ready, how I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a neat way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, yeah, I'll just keep you guys
updated on my little crop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you updated on my mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we have the Afghani and
the Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enjoying a little bit of sun,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of beautiful British
Columbian sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean and mountains in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be some very happy moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these will be moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt safer soaked them before he brought
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see no signs of any bugs or any mildews
or any problems whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real nice, healthy little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Skunk and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up we have the Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara Bud update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara's doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also bug free, mold free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great tight internoting on
these arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's done a nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this would be a great little plant
to flower with just a single top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing four or five nice big arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's not getting flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just gonna be a mom for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mummy styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the ganja more and more each and
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the ganja more and more each and
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rise this morning, this morning.
I've got to have me some ganja.
But I see the new day dawn, dawn.
For light and spliff of ganja.
Everyone got their own thing doing,
doing, doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me, I've got to have some sentimental
each and every day.
Yeah.
