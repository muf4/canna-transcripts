[SPEAKER_03]: Which are chemical compounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they express that for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants themselves are threatened
either by a disease or by sometimes by a
[SPEAKER_03]: predator or for whatever environmental
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants express secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondary metabolites are nothing but
chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually isolate them and take them
out, they are as chemical as much as a
[SPEAKER_03]: drug can be a chemical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to understand that even though
their origin and their source is natural,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are expressing chemicals inside them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those chemical compounds are the ones
that we are actually benefiting from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for whatever reason that they have been
there by nature, that is really what we
[SPEAKER_03]: are trying to capture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said to you before that for a
nutraceutical, for this added nutritional,
[SPEAKER_03]: added health benefit, that knowledge is
key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we get that knowledge from?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two sources that we can get that
knowledge from.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is what I have described as
ethnomedicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is knowledge that has come down
from millennia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are ethnomedical practitioners
or traditional medicine practices from
[SPEAKER_03]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Ayurveda and Anani type of
traditional medicines in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are African medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are European medical systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's traditional Chinese medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming from millennia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge that particular herb or plant is
very good for a particular ailment or as a
[SPEAKER_03]: tonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the only source of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the scientific way of actually
going and looking for plants that may not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily have had that history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are many natural sources that we
don't use as medicinals or nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean that they don't have that
value?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also express that same secondary
metabolites which might be of benefit to
[SPEAKER_03]: human health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marine sources are a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica has our waters of marine algae and
various other sponges and so on have not
[SPEAKER_03]: been yet tapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own plants, 23% of our endemic
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are only found in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of them are actually used as
nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't eat it, does that mean that
they don't have a benefit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well actually they might.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where science comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can actually test them and see if they
have medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whichever of the two sources that one
has captured, whether you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional knowledge or whether you're
using a scientific group, and have
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered that there is a value in a
particular plant or a source of water or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, then can we just bottle it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we market it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we take it and put it into the market
and call it a nutraceutical?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the question that we're
trying to answer in launching a
[SPEAKER_03]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well my answer to that is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: One should not do that if you are talking
about launching an industry that is to
[SPEAKER_03]: last a long time and is of global
standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those products ought to have two very,
very important facets to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is safety, proof of safety for
human consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if possible, proof of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: For whatever that product is, is it
efficacious for the claim that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making it to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are some of those things that you
must have and how does it tie in with
[SPEAKER_03]: science?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a product is to have, is to be known
as safe, then it must, let's take a
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we must know, we must be able to have
good agricultural practices associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must have good manufacturing processes
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must be able to standardize it and we
must also show that it is safe for human
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, efficacy is to be able
to link whatever you're taking to show
[SPEAKER_03]: that it has that added benefit to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This process here, which I think most of
you might see, is actually takes you
[SPEAKER_03]: through a small process step.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually shows you the value addition
in partnering with science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are simply taking a plant that
is grown, then you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand how agricultural processes
impact what the plant is producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, we had discussed about
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: These secondary metabolites, how are they
expressed as you change seasons?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they expressed, how are they
varied as you change the growing
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about if you use organic versus
non-organic?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are these secondary metabolites
expressed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore we must have a good
understanding of those conditions in order
[SPEAKER_03]: to have an industry that is based purely
on being able to reproduce every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be able to understand those
quantities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we must be able to
have is sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: For that same industry to be able to grow,
we need to have all of these factors fully
[SPEAKER_03]: understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second step is being able to
take those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to make an extract,
then being able to take the extract using
[SPEAKER_03]: science as much as possible to ensure that
those secondary metabolites are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: with you as you extract them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to, every single time being
able to link back and see what the
[SPEAKER_03]: quantities are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those standardizations are extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also important to be able to have
traceability.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to say what your batch,
being able to trace to where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, for proof of efficacy
to go into the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're saying that a particular plant
is very good as an antioxidant,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you need to prove it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last of all, to be able to take
it to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now clinical evaluations are not necessary
for all nutraceutical products,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you go down that route,
then we add value to your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where can we get all of this done here
in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_03]: At a laboratory scale level, there's UWI
that engages in both safety and efficacy,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as chemistry department that does
quantifications, biotechnology center
[SPEAKER_03]: that's engaged in both production at an in
vitro level, as well as product
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's UTEC and NCU.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your tertiary institutes that
engage in this kind of research that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can partner with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you develop at the lab
scale, of course we need to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: take it to the pilot scale, and that's
where SRC comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last of all, I'm gonna leave you with
three types of products.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be three types of
nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, sort of a product that doesn't
necessarily claim nutritional,
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't claim a medicinal,
and you can put that out without
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily claiming in your label that it
has that added value.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course you can have the second
type, which claims a medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third time, which claims a full
health benefit and medicinal claim that
[SPEAKER_03]: has gone through the clinical route.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brings us to the regulations that
Jamaica needs to undertake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our panelists hopefully will also
touch on some of those regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Ministry of Health is here and they
are working on amending some of the laws
[SPEAKER_03]: to fit the nutritional industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna leave you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your patience.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Rupika.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll hold all questions until later.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also gonna ask our panelists to try
and stick within a five-minute time frame
[SPEAKER_14]: as we must commence official closing of
the opening ceremony at 2.30.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rupika alluded to the Santa Research
Council serving our primary function in
[SPEAKER_14]: moving our products from the lab stage to
that of the industrial level or to the
[SPEAKER_14]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_14]: We at the Santa Research Council has a
long history in developing
[SPEAKER_14]: nutraceutical-related products.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have formulated a number of teas and a
number of other products with
[SPEAKER_14]: well-established therapeutic benefits and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_14]: I advise you to just take a look at the
Santa Research Council's booth and get a
[SPEAKER_14]: clear idea in terms of some of the stuff
we are doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, for most of the practitioners here,
you'll find a line of products.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of the 10 major practitioners here,
eight of the products on display were
[SPEAKER_14]: actually developed by the Santa Research
Council.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have the capacity, we have the
know-it-all, we have the technical
[SPEAKER_14]: expertise to move your products from the
exploratory level to actual products on
[SPEAKER_14]: the market with the hope of it eliciting
that part of the benefit that you had
[SPEAKER_14]: planned at the onset.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I encourage you have a chat with the
SRC team and have some discussions with
[SPEAKER_14]: your practitioners and exhibitors so
you'll be more aware of our capabilities
[SPEAKER_14]: and competences.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am now going to move to a very critical
component and it has been a vexed issue in
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamaica for years as it relates to
protecting the intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I'd like to invite Mrs.
Bellamy to give you an overview of the
[SPEAKER_14]: services offered by AGIBO and how they can
assist you in protecting your innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
members of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank you for inviting me this
afternoon to do a very brief presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have five minutes and I'm very tall,
so I usually speak for a short time
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can see me, so I don't have to
talk long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want you to remember two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like you to visit our website,
so everybody should be writing now,
[SPEAKER_01]: www.jipo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I see you've got your pen,
so I'll wait for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's www.jipo.gov.jm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want any questions answered,
you can write us at info, I-N-F-O,
[SPEAKER_01]: at jipo.gov.jm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an area that we have been doing
work in at the international and the local
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually, we're far advanced in our
work in the Caribbean and in Jamaica in
[SPEAKER_01]: the area of finding protection for our
traditional knowledge, traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural expressions and our genetic
resources, which deals with our subject
[SPEAKER_01]: area today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a draft regional treaty,
which is to be considered by the heads
[SPEAKER_01]: with responsibility for intellectual
property and then to be transferred to the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads of government for them to give their
sign off on it, which would mean that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would be able to put local legislation in
place that looks at protecting from the
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view of intellectual property
your rights associated with traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, traditional cultural
expressions and genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a new area in terms of
intellectual property rights because
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally this area was looked at as
the common heritage of mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been a thrust
internationally from local communities and
[SPEAKER_01]: we have our local community that is
represented here today and we are all
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of the recent passage of the
amendment of the Dangerous Drugs Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: which deals with one of our critical
genetic resources in Jamaica, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be protected under this piece of
legislation that will come into being.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are the other usual areas of
industrial property and intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property, which is trademarks,
patents, designs and copyright and related
[SPEAKER_01]: rights, which most persons in Jamaica are
aware of, which deals with all forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: literary works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a nutshell, that's what
intellectual property is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you send me an email at that
address which I gave you, we will respond
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you visit our website, there's also
further information on how to contact us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our phone number, just in case you
don't want to go to the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: is 946.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can save it directly on the phone if
you don't want to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: 946-1300 or 946-0789.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also brought some brochures.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I heard I had five minutes I brought
brochures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested, you can check me
and I'll give you a brochure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll move right along.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane Edwards, President of JamPro.
[SPEAKER_14]: She'll give us an idea in terms of the
business opportunities that exist locally,
[SPEAKER_14]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you join me in welcoming Ms. Edwards?
[SPEAKER_13]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks
for inviting JamPro to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_13]: launch of this really exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, JamPro is all about business.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are we here for is how do we develop
this industry into an export industry,
[SPEAKER_13]: a sustainable industry, as you heard from
Dr. Delgota.
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, the global nutraceuticals
market is valued at over 207 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: by 2016.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where it's supposed to grow to.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to stress that point.
[SPEAKER_13]: The market is being driven by rising
health care costs in metropolitan
[SPEAKER_13]: countries, aging population, growing
interest in healthy lifestyles and natural
[SPEAKER_13]: products, beauty, the whole beauty
industry, and the desire to be younger and
[SPEAKER_13]: healthier and live longer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's essentially what's driving this
industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think Jamaica has a really exciting
opportunity here, particularly in the R&D
[SPEAKER_13]: that we have behind the industry,
in the innovation and intellectual
[SPEAKER_13]: property, as we've just heard.
[SPEAKER_13]: But most importantly, I think,
in establishing a total value chain from
[SPEAKER_13]: field to consumer, which is an opportunity
that we really have here if we seize it
[SPEAKER_13]: properly and if we develop the proper
frameworks and legislative structures that
[SPEAKER_13]: will allow us to grow this industry
internationally.
[SPEAKER_13]: We think there's opportunity for creation
of new Jamaican brands in health care,
[SPEAKER_13]: and branding is hugely important,
I think, because this is a heavily branded
[SPEAKER_13]: industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an industry that Big Pharma has
not really taken on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big pharmaceutical companies haven't
really taken on big time.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are very structured distribution
chains and there's a very professional
[SPEAKER_13]: industry internationally that we need to
tap into, particularly new channels like
[SPEAKER_13]: health food stores.
[SPEAKER_13]: We think there are growing synergies by
creating our own Jamaican branded
[SPEAKER_13]: synergies with health and wellness
tourism, which is an area that we are
[SPEAKER_13]: developing at Jamprow.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what can Jamprow do for you,
essentially?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, as I said, Jamprow is all about
business, helping businesses to grow and
[SPEAKER_13]: to thrive.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're involved in capacity building for
exporters, explaining to exporters how to
[SPEAKER_13]: access international markets, actually
finding those markets and finding those
[SPEAKER_13]: proper routes to market, because we need
to go down niche routes to market that can
[SPEAKER_13]: give us opportunities for value-added
products.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also about advising exporters on
packaging, on labeling, on how to comply
[SPEAKER_13]: with international agreements,
trade agreements on market access.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Delgoda spoke about quality standards
and traceability.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is absolutely critical to the
development of this industry, because if
[SPEAKER_13]: we don't implement HACCP ISO and good
manufacturing practices, we cannot access
[SPEAKER_13]: international markets.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yes, we are very involved,
Jamprow, in developing the regulatory
[SPEAKER_13]: framework that has to govern this industry
if we are to achieve world-class
[SPEAKER_13]: standards.
[SPEAKER_13]: So exciting business, exciting
opportunity, but we've got to focus on
[SPEAKER_13]: developing the proper frameworks for us to
develop.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Jamprow is here to help you.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a website, www
.jamaicatradeandinvest.com.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't know, I'll give you my card.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very excited at the launch of this
industry, and we look forward to
[SPEAKER_13]: developing and building a sustainable
industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to share things a bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we move to the business and the
financing aspect of industrial industry,
[SPEAKER_14]: or the sustainable development component,
I'd like to invite my dear friend,
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Anitha Graham.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the managing director of Winchester
Surgical Center, Caribbean School of
[SPEAKER_14]: Medical Sciences, Jamaica, and also a
professor at the University of Technology,
[SPEAKER_14]: to speak briefly on healing waters and
then move into the business aspect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Graham.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Cliff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to recognize the diplomatic corps
here, as well as the mayor.
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor is tucked in her little corner.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's so important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Without her, we can't stop this thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd like to just say, when you look at
the health and wellness industry,
[SPEAKER_11]: and when you look at nutraceuticals,
our healing waters and our mineral baths,
[SPEAKER_11]: they are very important, and they are part
of the whole question of wellness and
[SPEAKER_11]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our healing water is the most famous
three.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are Milk River, Rockford Mineral
Bath, and St. Thomas Bath and Mineral Spa.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important to recognize them
because from a scientific point of view,
[SPEAKER_11]: they are really healing, and a lot of
people remember the history that both in
[SPEAKER_11]: St. Thomas and Milk River were being
discovered because slaves were beaten,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then they went to these waters,
and they got healed, and therefore their
[SPEAKER_11]: bosses took it up from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But importantly, what is it that they
carry?
[SPEAKER_11]: Milk River Bath has ionizing radiation,
and it has about 16 curies in a million
[SPEAKER_11]: parts per liter, and it's one of the most,
has the most concentration of ionizing
[SPEAKER_11]: radiation in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is 54 times that of France and
Switzerland, and about 16 times that of
[SPEAKER_11]: Bath in England.
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what it does to us is important
because ionizing radiation is
[SPEAKER_11]: anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you find is that, for example,
people who have been to Milk River have
[SPEAKER_11]: been noted to have their arthritis and
their back pains and their swellings and
[SPEAKER_11]: infections healed because their ionizing
radiation is anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's also anti-cancerous.
[SPEAKER_11]: It helps pain, and apart from that,
it is anti-microbial.
[SPEAKER_11]: So those people with infections and so on,
when they go to, for example, Bath,
[SPEAKER_11]: which has a high sulfur content,
you find that their infection would have
[SPEAKER_11]: been subsided or healed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you find that healing waters are
very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another aspect of healing waters is that
they have nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have minor minerals like cadmium,
potassium, chloride, and so on,
[SPEAKER_11]: that are very important for the body.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they always argue that when you go
to St. Thomas, if you drink the water and
[SPEAKER_11]: get the hot bath at the same time and hot
massage, it helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't know exactly what we have and
how we can market this industry and become
[SPEAKER_11]: part of that $2.5 billion and recognize
that Milk River and Bath St. Thomas are so
[SPEAKER_11]: important.
[SPEAKER_11]: From a scientific point of view as well,
we have to look at partnering with the
[SPEAKER_11]: Scientific Research Council, the
University of the West Indies,
[SPEAKER_11]: the University of Technology, NCU,
and other academic institutions,
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as Ministry of Health and so on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, for example, the sulfur in St.
Thomas' fountain, at Bath Fountain,
[SPEAKER_11]: can be very important.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because suppose you are allergic to
sulfur, then it may be important that if
[SPEAKER_11]: you go there and you have some little
bumps on your body and so on, allergic
[SPEAKER_11]: reactions, it may be that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to look at in terms of the
contents and constituents of our healing
[SPEAKER_11]: waters and recognize the benefits as well
as sometimes the little dangers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I must say that even though Milk River has
such ionizing radiation, Rockford too has
[SPEAKER_11]: some minerals that are very important and
they don't recommend that you stay in
[SPEAKER_11]: these for more than 15 to 45 minutes at a
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they are not as bad as the cautions
that are there, but the precautions must
[SPEAKER_11]: be important.
[SPEAKER_11]: And therefore, it's so important that we
recognize the values, the healing values,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the nutraceutical and nutritional
values of our healing waters here in
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is well worth it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not short of healing plants,
healing waters in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have quite a bit of research and a
number of research entities in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_14]: which have been doing extensive work in
developing products, determine the
[SPEAKER_14]: scientific principles underlying their
therapeutic properties of our natural
[SPEAKER_14]: plants, some of our invertebrates,
as well as our waters.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, key importance to us also is how
do we start up these businesses?
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do we seek the financing?
[SPEAKER_14]: And how do we ensure that we do it in a
sustainable way?
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I'd like to invite Mr.
Porter to give us an idea in terms of the
[SPEAKER_14]: support services in place on the JVDC in
the startup of nutraceutical industries.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Porter.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: All protocols observed.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just spending my five minutes to
tell you a little bit about what we do at
[SPEAKER_10]: JVDC and how we fit into this puzzle
supporting the nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, for us, it is about business and
doing business the right way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting from the start point,
we have this mantra, JVDC, from concept to
[SPEAKER_10]: market.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about how do you now take these
ideas and make them into sustainable
[SPEAKER_10]: businesses?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you convert your ideas into
products?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you ensure that they are
competitive, that they meet international
[SPEAKER_10]: standards and so on?
[SPEAKER_10]: At JVDC, we like to consider ourselves a
role of the sleeve organization.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're implementers and we work directly
with entrepreneurs and other creative
[SPEAKER_10]: persons of a business to concretize these
business ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: We work in certain pillars.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our business pillar where it is
about business assessment, looking at the
[SPEAKER_10]: viability of your business idea,
putting together your business strategies
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our coaching program and mentoring program
takes you through the steps to ensure that
[SPEAKER_10]: your business, whether you're a startup or
existing business, that you concretize
[SPEAKER_10]: your ideas and you're doing it to
international standards and meeting market
[SPEAKER_10]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a technical arm, which I'm a
part of, and that is about the product
[SPEAKER_10]: development and the packaging and branding
side.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have heard Jampro mention the
importance of building your brand and
[SPEAKER_10]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_10]: For us, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about how do you package your
product to meet international standards,
[SPEAKER_10]: to meet consumer needs?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you make your packaging attractive?
[SPEAKER_10]: To do it in a way which calls upon
available resources, look at constraints
[SPEAKER_10]: that we may have and how we can come up
with the best and most creative packaging
[SPEAKER_10]: solution that we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a team of graphic designers,
for example, who work on creating the most
[SPEAKER_10]: suitable and attractive packaging solution
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about understanding what the
industry is about, tapping into the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: natural vibe of the industry and give your
packaging solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also about bridging and crossing
over into other industries.
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, we work quite a bit with the
natural fiber industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can natural fibers be a part of this?
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of nutraceutical products are
generated from plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the other spin-off products that
can be created from other parts of the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant which may contribute to the
packaging, it may contribute to a new
[SPEAKER_10]: product?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other side that we're heavily involved
in is on the marketing.
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, in Jamaican stores,
we actually get it into the hands of the
[SPEAKER_10]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is about pitching brand Jamaican,
authentic Jamaican products, quality
[SPEAKER_10]: products, and we use that to get the
products out into the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we also have our engineering
team where conversion, the value added
[SPEAKER_10]: aspect of it, how do we convert that raw
material into the actual product in a very
[SPEAKER_10]: efficient way?
[SPEAKER_10]: For your plant layout, for your quality
control systems, production management.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether you are a micro producer or small
or medium sized producer, we work with you
[SPEAKER_10]: depending on the scale you are to
implement the appropriate measures that
[SPEAKER_10]: can make you successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is in a nutshell, cut time is
limited.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is in a nutshell what we do at JBDC.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also visit our website which is
jbdc.net.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are on Facebook and social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can visit our website, find out our
contact information, get more information
[SPEAKER_10]: about us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are located at 14 Camp Road and we have
our incubator resource center.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, they have a drive on the Garmix
Free Zone complex.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are open to working with persons in the
industry to make it quite a success.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much Mr. Porter.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to invite Ms. O'Connor from
First Global Bank in terms of giving us an
[SPEAKER_14]: idea of the financial resources that can
be made available for small and medium
[SPEAKER_14]: enterprises.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know having the science there and
everything and the engineers that
[SPEAKER_14]: facilitate development of a business,
you really need the financing to step out
[SPEAKER_14]: of that industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms. O'Connor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jamprow and JBDC, we want to say that
First Global Bank is all about business.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we are here for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very happy to be a part of this
launch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it amazing that despite being the
home of over 50% of the medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world, Jamaica today has not been
able to harness its resources to tap into
[SPEAKER_02]: this very lucrative market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notwithstanding the fact that many of us
have benefited from some bushy or some
[SPEAKER_02]: home remedies that have helped us with
diseases and sicknesses that have healed
[SPEAKER_02]: us in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And First Global Bank is saying today,
just by our mere presence, that hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are in support of this big business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in support of the launch and the
development of this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see its success.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are expecting great stories to come out
of it and we are saying we want to partner
[SPEAKER_02]: with you to help you to achieve this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years, we have partnered with the
DBJ to provide financing for the SMEs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the SME group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are saying that today, we want to
partner with the SMEs who will be
[SPEAKER_02]: operating in this new industry and how
we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, First Global Bank launched a new
product called the Easy Business Loan and
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about that for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, SMEs have always had some challenges
over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big challenges that SMEs have
is presenting financial information for
[SPEAKER_02]: their loans to access loan facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: What First Global Bank has done in
presenting this Easy Business Loan is
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, hey, we will look at your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will look at what financial information
you have, even though it may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: audited financials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are saying we are finding ways to
come up with products that will assist
[SPEAKER_02]: you, that will meet your needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have a very, you have peculiar
needs and we are saying we want to help
[SPEAKER_02]: you to meet those needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another product that we have developed
recently is our unsecured financing,
[SPEAKER_02]: unsecured loans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are saying to you, collateral has
been a challenge for you in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are willing to look at your business,
despite the fact that you may not be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to support a loan with collateral.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our big partnerships, First Global
Bank, is the DBJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the DBJ over the years have always
supported SMEs and micro businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, not a lot of SMEs take up
the facilities that the DBJ have out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And First Global Bank has always pushed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the major issues for SMEs is
the whole thing about capacity building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, DBJ, in assisting the SME to come
up, to put together, to build capacity and
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop their programs and their
products, have come up with what this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is called Voucher Technical
Assistance, the BT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it does for you is that it helps
you to get the necessary financing that
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to put together your financial
documents, your marketing plans,
[SPEAKER_02]: and your business plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you seek financing for your
small, nutraceutical business,
[SPEAKER_02]: or your medium-sized, nutraceutical
business, you will be seeking investor
[SPEAKER_02]: partners, you will be seeking loans from
financial institutions or other lending
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will need to present certain
documents.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, a business plan, that very
all-important business plan, that is your
[SPEAKER_02]: guide and your roadmap to the development
of your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the DBJ will do through the AFI,
through First Global Bank, is provide you
[SPEAKER_02]: with financing to access that help,
to access the help from consultants to put
[SPEAKER_02]: together your financial statements or your
marketing plan or your business plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will fund it up to 70% of the
cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that they will do for you is
to provide security, up to 50% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: value of the loan that you will be seeking
out from a bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: DBJ will give you 50% of that to a maximum
of $15 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we consider this partnership with DBJ
very important because it allows us to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet your need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows First Global Bank to meet your
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to do business with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we launch this industry together,
I'm here to say that First Global Bank is
[SPEAKER_02]: here to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a booth under the tent,
and we are welcoming you to come and speak
[SPEAKER_02]: with us to get more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much Peter.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, our last
presentation from our panelists,
[SPEAKER_14]: who are not pleased, Professor Anthony
Clay, who will be looking on what the
[SPEAKER_14]: future holds for the nutraceutical
industry in terms of exploiting the
[SPEAKER_14]: industry in a sustainable manner.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladies and gentlemen, Prof. Clay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I try this again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for turning out today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be talking a little bit this
afternoon about some of the extraordinary
[SPEAKER_06]: changes that we've been living through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is a truism, but we live
through, we're living in a time of
[SPEAKER_06]: unprecedented social, economic,
demographic and technological change.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of these changes do present
challenges and threats to the economies of
[SPEAKER_06]: the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are far more opportunities than
threats.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's just look at a couple of them and
see what they mean for us and for the
[SPEAKER_06]: development of this potential new
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today there are about 7 billion people
living in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: That number is going to increase a lot
over the course of the century.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time we get to the end of this
century, the world's population will be
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere in the range 9.5 to 12.5
billion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are going to be 2.5 to 5.5
billion more people than there are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the distribution is going to change
dramatically as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time we get halfway through this
century, about half the population of the
[SPEAKER_06]: planet will be Asian.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about a quarter will be African.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of the other nations of the world
will only add up to a quarter of the
[SPEAKER_06]: world's population.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the distribution of the world's
population will change really remarkably.
[SPEAKER_06]: But an even more significant change is
going to be the age distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time we get, the median age in the
world today is about 29.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time we get to 2050, the median age
will be 41.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about, by the time we get halfway
through the century, about a third of
[SPEAKER_06]: humanity will be over the age of 60.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be at least 3 billion people in
the world over the age of 60.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just imagine today if half of all
of the people in the world were retirees?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the number we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about half of today's global
population as retirees by the time we get
[SPEAKER_06]: to 2050.
[SPEAKER_06]: So by the time we get halfway through the
century, if you look at Europe for
[SPEAKER_06]: example, there will be two people over the
age of 60 for every child, for every child
[SPEAKER_06]: under the age of 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: The population of places like Europe will
be predominantly elderly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Japan will be an even more extreme case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And China is about to undergo the world's
most rapid transition into becoming an
[SPEAKER_06]: elderly population in history.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to start in just two or
three years from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So by the time we get halfway through the
century, there's going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them will live in Asia and Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll be a lot older on average than
they are now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're already seeing dramatic changes in
the world causes of death.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to see even more dramatic
changes as we go through this demographic
[SPEAKER_06]: transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I'm sure everybody remembers,
there was a lot of upset, a lot of concern
[SPEAKER_06]: about Ebola and the chikungunya virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to remember that in fact
these are not typical of what's happening
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the course of the last 15 years,
the global burden of disease, and we
[SPEAKER_06]: measure this in terms of numbers of lives
lost, has been falling dramatically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the last 15 years, the number of
lives lost due to disease has fallen by
[SPEAKER_06]: about one third.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we think that even further reductions
lie ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is because people are richer,
they're eating better diets, we've got
[SPEAKER_06]: better sanitation, and we've got better
medical care.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are living much longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the course of the last 100 years,
world average life expectancy has doubled.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rate of increase is continuing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time we get halfway through the
century, people will be living on average
[SPEAKER_06]: at least 10 years longer than they're
doing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be the case, within living
memory, that most people died of
[SPEAKER_06]: infectious disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is no longer true.
[SPEAKER_06]: The leading causes of death now are the
age-related degenerative and
[SPEAKER_06]: non-communicable diseases, including,
for example, cardiovascular disease and
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the major kinds of cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to give you one indicator,
in the UK today, just a little under half
[SPEAKER_06]: of all deaths are due to cardiovascular
disease, which costs the UK economy about
[SPEAKER_06]: $45 billion equivalent, US dollars
equivalent, in healthcare expenditure and
[SPEAKER_06]: lost productivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is going to be the norm,
increasingly, in the years ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already the case in Latin America and
the Caribbean that the leading causes of
[SPEAKER_06]: death are not the infectious diseases
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're age-related degenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually living long enough now to
die of degenerative disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we have to do now, this is the
next frontier in medical research,
[SPEAKER_06]: is we have to find a cost-effective way to
reduce the burden of the age-related
[SPEAKER_06]: degenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have to be able to do this for a
far greater number of people than ever
[SPEAKER_06]: before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the single most important
driver behind the development of the new
[SPEAKER_06]: industry for nutraceuticals and functional
foods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because these are foodstuffs and medical
products and ingredients in a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: format that contain actives and
micronutrients, most of them plant
[SPEAKER_06]: extracts, that give us a cost-effective
way, just by changing people's diet,
[SPEAKER_06]: to reduce the burden of age-related
degenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: In about 2010, the global market for these
products was estimated at about $140
[SPEAKER_06]: billion US dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time we get to the end of this
decade, most projections show it going
[SPEAKER_06]: over $200 billion US dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: About a third of the global market is in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe represents about a quarter,
but the real growth opportunities are,
[SPEAKER_06]: in fact, in the developing economies,
the new industrial economies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The market in India is growing at nearly
20% per annum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are really the markets that we
should be looking to now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some, not all, but some of the ingredients
needed for this new industry can be
[SPEAKER_06]: produced in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as many people here know,
I was the first to identify the potential
[SPEAKER_06]: of the nutraceuticals and functional foods
market for Jamaica, back in the late
[SPEAKER_06]: 1990s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time I did that research,
the market for nutraceuticals and
[SPEAKER_06]: functional foods was just one-tenth of the
size it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So over that period, this market has grown
tenfold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have lost out on a lot of that
growth opportunity, but the good news is
[SPEAKER_06]: that all the projections show that this
rate of growth is going to continue for
[SPEAKER_06]: many years yet to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is not too late.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can still get into this global market,
and we can still build a globally
[SPEAKER_06]: competitive industry in this country.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as several people have already pointed
out, the fact that the industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: the market is there, the fact that we have
products that we can manufacture and
[SPEAKER_06]: export from here in Jamaica does not
automatically mean it will happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a number of things we have to
get right, and if we cannot get them
[SPEAKER_06]: right, this industry will not work for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to be absolutely clear about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not about traditional herbalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not what the market now requires.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to focus on product quality,
on proven efficacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to have standards controls in
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to be able to trace any problems
with contamination back to source and deal
[SPEAKER_06]: with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, everything that you now
need to run a modern food or
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical export industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to be willing to do the work to
put all of the foundations and the true
[SPEAKER_06]: requisites for this new industry in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we do so, this is a market that is
projected to grow for the rest of this
[SPEAKER_06]: century.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time we get to the century,
it will be many times bigger than it is
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is still early days.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is still everything to play for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So provided we do the work now,
and I am hoping that today will be the
[SPEAKER_06]: start of a new commitment to build this
industry in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Provided we do that, then this country
could build a major future on the strength
[SPEAKER_06]: of this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we give our panelists a big round of
applause?
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like first to recognize Mayor
Bromberg.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome and thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a number of distinguished guests
in our audience today.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I begin to start calling names,
I know I'm going to get myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to thank you all for your kind
support and thanks for joining us here
[SPEAKER_14]: today.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a clear indication of your commitment
to development as well as the
[SPEAKER_14]: sustainability of a national industrial
industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, we get to the meat of the
matter.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have just about 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to open the floor for
questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can throw your questions out to our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you please rejoin us?
[SPEAKER_14]: So the floor is not open to our
participants.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can ask as many questions as you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll try our best to address them in
an amicable manner.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can show by raise a fan and I'll run
to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please also indicate a person to whom you
are directing the question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Paul Chan with the Ganja Future
Growers and Producers Association of
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: The professor is the director,
the professor who just spoke from the
[SPEAKER_12]: United Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the inputs, the plant... Professor,
does the plant inputs for this
[SPEAKER_12]: nutraceutical industry require certified
organic plant inputs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just correct one point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at the University of the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very proud of that fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not about organics, except
possibly as a marketing point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, the key is to identify the
actives.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, if you remember I said we're
not talking about traditional herbalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you actually have to do is identify
the complex molecular compound that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually has the identifiable health
benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you really... What we have to aim for
is to actually understand molecular
[SPEAKER_06]: pathway so that we can be very precise
about what it is we're addressing and how
[SPEAKER_06]: it is we can address it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what you have to do is you have
to do the extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you take a traditional herbal
product, you are getting some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: active that maybe does you some good,
but you are also getting typically
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of other molecular compounds,
some of which may in fact be bad for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I'm sure you know, there was a big
scandal a few years ago with some Chinese
[SPEAKER_06]: herbal medicine which it turned out was
actually quite toxic and caused permanent
[SPEAKER_06]: liver damage in some of the people who
took it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no, that's just a stage we came
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next stage is we have to identify the
compounds that actually do people good and
[SPEAKER_06]: extract them and then package them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may mean, for example,
microencapsulation and starch,
[SPEAKER_06]: which we have to do with the flavonoids,
for example, because to get the dose that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually does you good, you have to
actually be consuming so much that it
[SPEAKER_06]: would be unpalatable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there we need to look at cotton using
these products in starch so that when you
[SPEAKER_06]: consume them, they actually don't break
down until they're in your intestine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way you get the health benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the key to a lot of this industry is
to look at low cost delivery mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why functional foods has
actually probably got the potential rather
[SPEAKER_06]: than nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nutraceuticals, you put it in a
conventional medical format.
[SPEAKER_06]: But functional foods, you just put it in a
standard food or a bakery product or a
[SPEAKER_06]: drink or a spread, which means that people
can actually adopt a much, much healthier
[SPEAKER_06]: diet without having to make fundamental
changes to their lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, it looks very much to me,
is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you take, for example, the
flavonoids from turmeric that we believe
[SPEAKER_06]: act as, the flavonoids in turmeric can
take what something called tumor necrosis
[SPEAKER_06]: factor alpha, which is a cancer precursor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you introduce a higher level of
these compounds in people's diet,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can reduce the incidence of certain
categories of cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the way we have to go next.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this has to be a science-based
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can start by looking at traditional
herbal remedies.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good place to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to go to the next level, we have to do
the scientific assessment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Further questions?
[SPEAKER_14]: We can only take one more question.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask you to just have discussion to
the parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that the growing of marijuana
needed to go in-house with lights or
[SPEAKER_08]: outside with sunlight, does the property
of the plant changes depending on how it
[SPEAKER_08]: is grown, sunlight or artificial light?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I fear that if we concentrate just
on one particular type of growing,
[SPEAKER_08]: we may lose another aspect because of what
is natural and more achievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know enough about the specifics of
producing tetrahydrocannabinol,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think it is quite clear that as part
of the demographic change I talked about
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier, we have to look at much more
intensive ways of producing food and
[SPEAKER_06]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're going into a world where
we're going to have to feed another five
[SPEAKER_06]: and a half billion people over and above
the seven billion who are alive today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means we have to find ways to
produce more food, more fuel, more fiber,
[SPEAKER_06]: and more pharmaceutical products off a
smaller area of land than ever before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another one of the key directions of
scientific research is how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's clear we have to look at
production in intensive conditions,
[SPEAKER_06]: in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We simply will no longer be able to afford
the kind of extensive agricultural,
[SPEAKER_06]: inefficient agricultural systems we have
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that however it's going to
work, we have to find ways to produce more
[SPEAKER_06]: intensively in future.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Professor.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are deeply sorry for the rush.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that the next session of the
Prime Minister should be starting any time
[SPEAKER_14]: now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you understand the protocols with
the security details of the Prime
[SPEAKER_14]: Minister, we have to close out this
session with immediate effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank you all for being with us,
and thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we implore you to have discussions
with our distinguished panelists.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure they'll be able to guide you as
much as they can, and if not, we're
[SPEAKER_14]: directed to the respective agencies that
are going to be of guidance to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you please join me in giving our
panelists a big round of applause?
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for sticking with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we hope that you'll stay with us for
the official opening ceremony.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're asking for a cease and take of your
seats.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting ready for an official
function of your seats.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss James, can you report to the entrance
right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kimberly James.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kimberly James, can you report to the
entrance right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such a wonderful occasion to be
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who have just arrived,
you've missed the opportunity to look
[SPEAKER_04]: around at the research, at the people who
are supporting the research, and at the
[SPEAKER_04]: practitioners of the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Faye Ellington, and I will be guiding
you through this process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some yam spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had jerk, and they had yam spread
with cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had some moringa nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I go a little off, then you know
it's the moringa nuts that send me off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really very good, the work that's
being done here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me acknowledge all our ministers here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Minister Anthony Hilton, Minister Julian
Robinson, I want to acknowledge Professor
[SPEAKER_04]: Errol Morrison, Professor Henry Lowe,
all the scientists who have gathered here,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the persons who are involved in
support of one-way shape or form.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such an important project.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Morrison, yeah, I just mentioned
you, but you're just making sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is in order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those who have come from overseas,
we want to welcome you as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some changes, and I think I
might as well just handle those at this
[SPEAKER_04]: time on your approval.
[SPEAKER_04]: And explain why some of those changes have
occurred.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're perhaps wondering, where's the
Prime Minister?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not only did she have to attend a
funeral, Dr. Fenton Ferguson's mother's
[SPEAKER_04]: funeral this morning, but there was an
emergency meeting that she has had to
[SPEAKER_04]: attend to, but she will be coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are perhaps wondering about Minister
Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you haven't seen him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he has been called away on an
emergency meeting off the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say too much more on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he won't be here, but of course,
we have Minister Julian Robinson with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Honorable Derek Kelly is unable to be
here as well, and Dr. Lisa Myers,
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Lisa Myers-Morgan will be representing
the Honorable Derek Kelly and representing
[SPEAKER_04]: the Honorable Fenton Ferguson,
Dr. Kevin Harvey, the Permanent Secretary
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just welcome you all and tell you
that this is indeed a historic occasion,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you are just very, very special to be
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I go any further, it is my
pleasure to ask Reverend Dr. Stephen
[SPEAKER_04]: Jennings, the pastor of the Mona Circuit
of Baptist Churches, to come forward and
[SPEAKER_04]: ask for God's blessings on the occasion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us pray.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almighty God, you are maker of heaven and
earth, and you have given us all things
[SPEAKER_07]: freely to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thank you for making us stewards,
managers of the earth, and giving us the
[SPEAKER_07]: great responsibility not only to take care
of the earth, but to produce food and
[SPEAKER_07]: medicines for the healing of the nations.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask you now for your blessing upon this
launch of the national nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_07]: industry in this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thank you for all who have been working
hard in their various ways to produce
[SPEAKER_07]: health and wealth from the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we pray that you give continued
wisdom, understanding, and knowledge so
[SPEAKER_07]: that people might be better and their
lives might be transformed in positive
[SPEAKER_07]: ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: We pray that you might teach us not to be
greedy, but rather to support legitimacy
[SPEAKER_07]: and implement needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We pray that you might help us to be
people of sustainability, that we will
[SPEAKER_07]: keep the crops going, and that whatever
industries we produce might be able not
[SPEAKER_07]: only to satisfy individual needs,
but the common good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here are prayers today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask for your blessing, your guidance,
and your strength.
[SPEAKER_07]: This we pray in your name and for your
sake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps it's a good time to ask you to
make sure that your phones are on vibrate
[SPEAKER_04]: or silent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Reverend Steven,
Dr. Steven Jennings.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was growing up in the hills of
Clarendon, I think most of our medical
[SPEAKER_04]: needs were taken care of by the plants we
had around our home.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was leaf of life, and all we were
required to do was wash it and chew it to
[SPEAKER_04]: get rid of a cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was fever grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was sericea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sericea, some people call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed my lime leaf tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, lime leaf tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the lime, you know, but the lime leaf
tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't have lime tree,
just make a little cup of hot lemonade.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up with six different kind of
flower in and out of my country,
[SPEAKER_04]: rather for the non-Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_04]: At my home in rural Jamaica, there were
six different kinds of flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had banana flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had cassava flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had arrowroot flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had breadfruit flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had yam flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had the regular counter
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the things we made, see,
all look for me like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me is not at home with some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look good so I have this edge of me
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before me eat all of the proper things
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see how that doctor on the back there,
the one who have the baritone,
[SPEAKER_04]: him have all of those things as a young
man too, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he will tell you more about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point I'm making is these things
have always existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have used them in our homes for
domestic purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now time to get the real value and
explode this industry to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is really interesting,
you know, of the 160 plants declared as
[SPEAKER_04]: having medicinal properties worldwide,
there are over 80 that are endemic to
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: May I hear an amen.
[SPEAKER_04]: May I tell you we are blessed indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now time to ask some people who have
been working in this industry in this area
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Norman Wright, CEO of Perishables,
could you come forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you were here earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is Mr. Norman?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you just welcome him very warmly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are coming to the zoo for the first
time since it's been done over,
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you realize how much effort and
work has been put into this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need to really visit and take the
children along.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Mr. Norman Wright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen keenly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a promise.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the good book says, every moving thing
that live it shall be meat for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even as the green herb have I given you
all things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we invest in moringa, a long term
crop?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or ganja, a short term cash crop?
[SPEAKER_09]: There are idle plants, hungry idle ants,
and hungry bellies to be fed.
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1980, at the age of 24, when many
Jamaicans were migrating, I made a choice
[SPEAKER_09]: to stay in Jamaica and create employment
and domestic capital formation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started Perishables Jamaica Limited with
300 Jamaican dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: At that time, it was 175 US dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: At today's rate of exchange, it's $20,000.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, in 1980, there was not a
$60,000 penalty for starting a business.
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, I dare say I would not be standing
here talking to you today as a small
[SPEAKER_09]: farmer and businessman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our mission is to efficiently produce and
aggressively market indigenous
[SPEAKER_09]: agricultural products and buy products at
a reasonable price to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's think back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we make that $60,000 an incentive
for people who are wanting to get into
[SPEAKER_09]: business instead of a disincentive?
[SPEAKER_09]: The first indigenous herb we developed to
an industry was Satyrija Viminia,
[SPEAKER_09]: also known as Jamaican peppermint,
and we are the only tea company in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_09]: that produces indigenous Jamaican
peppermint.
[SPEAKER_09]: All others are imported.
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, we have over 500 farmers supplying
us this commodity.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have commercialized 13 traditional
Jamaican medicinal plants with small
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers and wild crafters, some of whom
are members of the South Manchester Herbs
[SPEAKER_09]: and Spices Multipurpose Cooperative
Society.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are currently developing another 20
plants under various brands, including our
[SPEAKER_09]: own Tops and Zipper Copper Itle Jamaican
brands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forgive me the commercial.
[SPEAKER_09]: We export our products to the USA,
Canada, the UK, and the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our products are competitively priced in
terms of quality and reliability of
[SPEAKER_09]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our business strengths are our human
resources, both external and internal,
[SPEAKER_09]: the development of unique medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: We use 96% local, raw materials in our
processing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are net earners of foreign exchange.
[SPEAKER_09]: We solar generate our daily electricity
needs and sell a little excess to the grid
[SPEAKER_09]: each day.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the threats to our business?
[SPEAKER_09]: Inconsistent and inferior quality
contaminated materials, weevils and pests.
[SPEAKER_09]: I dare say the additional 100% increase in
asset tax is a threat to our business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lack of water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water is life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on the example of the Yellows Water
Pipeline, I hope that the government of
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica and the bot-side companies will in
the near future find it possible to
[SPEAKER_09]: convert some of the craters that are
created in the highlands of our country
[SPEAKER_09]: into water reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_09]: This water could be gravity-fed,
yes, not pumped using electricity to
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers downstream to provide sustainable
water supplies for the production of our
[SPEAKER_09]: herbs and spices.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to harvest, store, distribute this
precious commodity more intelligently for
[SPEAKER_09]: our long-term development.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm closing.
[SPEAKER_09]: My mission is to share as much knowledge,
technology, resources, and skills with my
[SPEAKER_09]: brothers and sisters so we can build and
develop a long-term sustainable,
[SPEAKER_09]: nutraceutical industry while contributing
to keeping the Jamaican social fabric
[SPEAKER_09]: together.
[SPEAKER_09]: God has been my guide and he determines my
destiny, my mission.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came into this world with nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will leave the same way with nothing,
but Jamaica will be different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we invest in moringa or ganja,
the resolution might yet be to develop
[SPEAKER_09]: piaba, dog blood, donkey weed,
rango dasha lung, stevia, or lignum vitae.
[SPEAKER_09]: To this end, it is understood that our
human resources will determine the success
[SPEAKER_09]: of our industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have to search with heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: Find the answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a promise.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Norman.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a promise, and you've been a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And friends, it is now my pleasure to ask
the Chief Research Officer of SCEEP in the
[SPEAKER_04]: USA, Reverend Dr. Kim Run, the Caesar,
to come forward and bring his testimony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you welcome him?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Jamaican welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Reverend Dr. Kim Run, the Caesar from
Cedar Labs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to thank this
community, your ministers, UTEP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all you folks for allowing me here to
participate in this amazing thing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of background, I'm a chemist,
I've been a healer, a chemist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ordained minister for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an herbalist for nearly 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think an important thing that we need to
look at here, and what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish is, and what I hope SCEEP help
brings, is the ability to bring you
[SPEAKER_00]: answers through testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers as to, to a great degree,
what you have, so you can better decide
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers to what hidden potentials in the
way of different cannabinoids in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help different illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to help where we can to educate
your university.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to help any way we can with the
science we have to move the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: projects forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to tell you why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may be a little emotional,
because it's near dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a tremendous number of very,
very sick children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't always win those situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently in the United States,
one of the most important drugs we need
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from Mother Earth and this
plant is a compound called CBD to stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very little in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working hard to create it,
but when you create it, from the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: up, because Mother Nature didn't have it
there, it takes a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, when these children are
incredibly sick, and we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them from dying, we give them
terrible drugs that keep them alive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but destroy their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, we not only are
creating devastation to our patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're devastating their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they live in tight group communities,
we're devastating those communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's extremely frustrating to me that
wonderful medicinals like CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: don't kill anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no capacity to stop you from
breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no capacity pretty much to cause
a lethal dose without eating and consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amounts far beyond what anybody
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rarely have major allergic reactions
or intolerances.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that about a new drug we're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty hard thing to know that
as a healer, when you've got to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult decision, am I going to give
this patient, this young patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these terrible drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I really certain they're likely to die
if I don't give them to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real tough position to put any
healer, any physician, any herbalist into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, part of coming here is
hoping that you will let me assist you in
[SPEAKER_00]: leading the way in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understanding why these sort of
treatments are much more humane,
[SPEAKER_00]: why these treatments have greater dignity
to them, why these treatments have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of compassion to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why I'm extremely hopeful
about Jamaica is, as a very spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: person, I know a spiritual nation when I
see one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a spiritual nation that
was basically created out of a demand for
[SPEAKER_00]: dignity and a strong, compassionate
feeling, you can make these things happen
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very wonderful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, we're up against all
sorts of walls where that's concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people close their shades at night
rather than opening their window at night
[SPEAKER_00]: to look across the street and say,
is my neighbor okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're losing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a highly spiritual nation based on
compassion, there's almost nothing you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may think in some ways,
I know the world sees some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, or resources, I don't believe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you have a huge resource in
spirituality in your entire community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, Mother Nature has given you a
rainforest that's filled with herbals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, cannabis is important,
but there are many important drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: are better to give the patients and the
drugs we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a great number of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a desire to improve your
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not just at the individual
level, it's the entire community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see that in the United
States to the degree I see it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: except in the small mountain colonies,
the small mountain communities like where
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the big cities, that kind of spirit
is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's asleep, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I will tell you is, if you allow
us to help you, if you allow me to do what
[SPEAKER_00]: I can to assist you, I will happily come
back and work at the university teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: your people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you every medicinal remedy I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will help you develop others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go out in your forest like I've
been doing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to a beach when I got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to a beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here for recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Olivia, the person planning all
this for me, fill up my calendar,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me talk to as many communities and as
many people as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you allow me to do this,
I will be immensely thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you're patient with your
program, and if you're encouraged to build
[SPEAKER_00]: your program, I think in a very short
amount of time, the rest of the world is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be looking towards Jamaica and
saying, what is going down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, I have patients in
states like Florida on the far other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of our country who, because they can't do
what they need, but they can get it from
[SPEAKER_00]: me and get it from California,
every month they have to make a pilgrimage
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way across the country to get the
medicines and treatments their children
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need it, you know how strong
parents are and how much courage they
[SPEAKER_00]: have, and they will go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come up with a medical program here
that is the best medical program,
[SPEAKER_00]: people will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know every father, every mother will
bring their children here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're sick, they'll come here
because this is where they know to get
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, reliable, spiritual medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else I can tell you
other than I'm incredibly grateful for
[SPEAKER_00]: this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
