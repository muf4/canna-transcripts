[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is almost 420 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, early flight today with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do the champs show.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Wednesday, 21st, and we're
starting the champs.
[SPEAKER_11]: The champs on Friday, I believe,
on the 23rd.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to be there with a couple
of days to spare.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully we'll bump into some of the good
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, of course, been consuming my
coconut butter.
[SPEAKER_11]: God, it just reeks like barb, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Such a nice little way to get the day
started.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit of the coconut butter,
just the tiniest little bit, will give me
[SPEAKER_11]: a real nice vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to bring it on the plane,
so I will have it with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess, really, I just wanted to
share with you guys a little bowl this
[SPEAKER_11]: morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got my bubble pressed out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little of the OG Kush, and then a tiny
little bit of the barb.
99%.
[SPEAKER_11]: She melts right in your hands,
that one, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just have the tiniest little bit out on
the card, and it is melty.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we got our beeline.
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to go join John at the airport for a
nice quick flight, about five hours or so
[SPEAKER_11]: to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got myself a Game of Thrones I'm going to
watch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to get blasted off the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a big vape session out in front
of the airport when we get there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we'll start the day with a Wake
and Baker.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, 419, I guess I better yap for one
more minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we better call John.
[SPEAKER_11]: John, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what John's doing for 420.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if we can get in touch with John
in time.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what Johnny B's saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're almost at 420.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's give John the one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good morning, John.
[SPEAKER_11]: One minute warning is over, and it is 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_11]: you're already on the road, bud?
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I got you on camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say happy 420 to all the listeners and the
watchers, and we're going to see you at
[SPEAKER_11]: the airport in about 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420 on a puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you soon, brother.
See you soon, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's John, four in the morning,
and the guy's in a bloody good mood,
[SPEAKER_11]: always in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we love about John B.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we like watching him.
[SPEAKER_11]: We enjoy hearing his stories and seeing
what he's up to, because the guy's just a
[SPEAKER_11]: great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Swiss perk rips, coconut oil dips,
and it looks like we're off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to Toronto?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my bong bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm so happy today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got more shit than you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten suitcases?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one's full of medtainers,
then I have this one, then I have this one
[SPEAKER_02]: full of weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to carry fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole thing is we're going to be
making dry sit more at Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the Astro Boy and I have the
watermelon, and we're going to crush it
[SPEAKER_02]: over screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check these bags in and then go have
a sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's a medtainer on the ground
there.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: But whose is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we really just find that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just found that.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone just ditched all their joints
right before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take those with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep those joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep those joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just found, well, I just found and
then pointed it out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That medtainer container was on the ground
at the entrance to the airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now open it up one more time just
because it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells dank, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medtainer John picks up the medtainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, these are born around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, we are not making this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just walked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That container was on the ground full of
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the day we start one, two,
three, four and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a guy that found five big fat
joints on the way into the airport today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a happy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, John.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice and loud out here at the
Vancouver airport.
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like 5 to 30, 6 in the morning right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is public safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy who lost his medtainer on the way
into the airport, he was puffing up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were puffing up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny's wondering if the guy's on an
international flight.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, this is our big, huge,
giant airport session.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue on with puffs and
trippy sticks, eat some coconut oil,
[SPEAKER_11]: and head on in.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already checked in, so it's just a
matter of security, which is pretty chill
[SPEAKER_11]: here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then jumping on our flight.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bravo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we come.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was security checks.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_11]: John's titanium set off the alarm,
and he had to take away basically all of
[SPEAKER_11]: his clothes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had to take my belt off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy in front of me had to take his
shoes off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put my trippy stick right in the
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran mine through the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to love being Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: C-51.
[SPEAKER_02]: C-51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we were filming at security,
and we were told you can't film at
[SPEAKER_02]: security.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not filming at security anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not allowed to film at security.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're allowed to bring our weed
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you can bring your weed in your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to have to get off here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is breakfast time, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some egg, cheese, croissant
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 15 minutes to wait for our
flight, so we'll be trippy sticking and
[SPEAKER_02]: eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pee now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

coffee, drink, Pringles, cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is pretty sweet.

with bubble cash and proper natural
[SPEAKER_10]: extractions knowing that her son is going
to use cannabis for her medication she
[SPEAKER_10]: wants to find a cleaner way and methods
well she's worried about him she's worried

[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not too shabby, eh?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice little view of the shitty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a huge shitty fan myself,
but if you're going to be in the shitty,
[SPEAKER_11]: you might as well have a view of it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: And all the little ants marching.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can just videotape these people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good thing this isn't a scope.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: D-nail session, John?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we need the desk for.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So John was a bit choked when we got to
our room.
[SPEAKER_11]: He wasn't feeling it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beds are a little closed for a couple of
dudes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we, Fred and Wilma?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have computers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a couch.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need hardwood floors.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're changing our room.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we puffed this one into this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you got your passes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just got them for the party.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the weed guy, we just blazed down.
[SPEAKER_11]: They filmed it for their channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out on his YouTube channel,
our little hangout here, which is at.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so baked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark Cloakheed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full melt to the dome.
[SPEAKER_07]: The weed guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it easy, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny, Johnny, and Avery in the house on
Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still doing this Puff Wednesday
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great day.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm jumping in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're puffing here with some fresh
roses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I phoned him for 420 this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, hey, John, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm taking a hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we met at the airport about an hour
later.
[SPEAKER_11]: We found five joints and a meditator on
the way in to the airport.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys just flew in today?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is for a hardcore down hitter who
just got some beautiful, nice fresh roses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some fresh roses.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is her first time smoking
solventless.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything before this was like shatter,
BHO stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on a hit that you just did on Shadow,
you'd probably be coughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I would be coughing as long
as.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: So where are you from?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just up north.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm just up north.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 73 microns.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can imagine where it's like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's overlooking the ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, anywhere in Toronto is like
two grand.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Puff Wednesday going on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Puff Wednesday with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like an initial cough.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like that follow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't control.
[SPEAKER_10]: That cough was a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That uncontrollable thing seems to be a
little bit of a chemical issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all of a sudden you've done some
crazy concentration.
You're like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've coughed to that grown up many
times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's get you on the solventless
trip.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get you off of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were just talking to some parents,
some concerned parents for their son.
[SPEAKER_11]: Her son was probably 18 or 19 or 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: And somehow we started talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: John started talking to her first.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we ended up talking to her about
cannabis and concentrates and not solvent
[SPEAKER_11]: free, basically.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the extracts that are used.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not just safe to make.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Safer to smoke.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Safer overall.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just said from a parental point of
view, you'll just appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he'll still be able to use his rigs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And imagine your mom turns you on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I met this guy by the man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And John B.
[SPEAKER_11]: at the airport.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they gave me their card.
[SPEAKER_11]: We really thought we should have invited
her on this and did a little interview
[SPEAKER_11]: with her.
[SPEAKER_11]: And been like, hey, you know, whatever his
name is, we're talking to you right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We met your mom at the airport.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, get on the solventless kick.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing hitting the shatters
all day long?
[SPEAKER_11]: Your mom's worried.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're with her 20 minutes and she's
almost ready to try something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went out and had a big bong rip out in
front of the airport.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys were already flying with your
glass, I assume?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we pulled it out in the airport and
walked out front, that one right there,
[SPEAKER_11]: and had a huge session.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, people off the street were like,
is that weed?
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're like, attach.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like, can I hit that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And some other girls are like,
I want one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was unbelievable, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you guys like Toronto airport as
opposed to the airport?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fly to Toronto all the time and they
just seem a little bit more, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're so big.
[SPEAKER_11]: The airport's so big, they see so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't imagine that a rig is really on
their radar.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, one more dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting out of the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hit a big one, babe.
Hey,
[SPEAKER_11]: this has been a great Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: We met some pretty cool people,
had some great puffs, eaten some good
[SPEAKER_11]: food, bumped into some familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just the first day, John.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_11]: And have a puffy Wednesday.
