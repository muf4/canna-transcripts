[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am of course Bubble Man and I am out in
my world.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm out here early, early, early.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be meeting up with D420K
today and I'm not exactly sure what
[SPEAKER_10]: exactly we're going to be doing,
but I suspect it's going to be involving
[SPEAKER_10]: bowls and adventures.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I've really been most
focused on on Bubble Man's World lately,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm not sure if you guys have noticed,
is promoting a healthy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Promoting a lifestyle outside of just
sitting around and maybe playing video
[SPEAKER_10]: games on the couch or just watching
movies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I'm against those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are wonderful, great, fun things to
use up some of your time with,
[SPEAKER_10]: but for God's sakes, get out there and be
with people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get out there and session.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get out there and do.
[SPEAKER_10]: BC is such a do place.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an incredible amount of epic fun
available to us, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, right now I'm thinking of
opening up the mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's epic fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a little bowl with you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got the Taurus with me today.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit of water right here behind
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice full bottle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tell you, when you go out on the water,
you really want to make sure you have a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of fresh water with you because the
salt water is surrounding you,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's pretty much useless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to wet the whistle there.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got a new bowl today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really all about the quartz,
you guys know, especially when I'm out and
[SPEAKER_10]: about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, I love the silicon carbide and
the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_10]: D-Nail sent me this a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a brand new offset deep dish bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see it comes apart real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just got a 14-4 hole that's going to
go right into my mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I do have a DC quartz banger here
that I could easily rip as well,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I haven't ripped this yet,
so I thought this is my opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, it goes in real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could use a drop down on that if you're
uncomfortable with putting a titanium nail
[SPEAKER_10]: into your pipe, whether it be a mothership
or any other pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally understand where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a D-Nail on this, I would 100%
drop this in the ground, but for a quick
[SPEAKER_10]: little tour, I think it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got my hybridized sublimator D-Nail
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've put the top of the sublimator carb
with the bottom of the titanium D-Nail
[SPEAKER_10]: one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got the D right on top there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've also got, oh man,
I'm really loving this dabber that D-Nail
[SPEAKER_09]: sent me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the feel of the wood in my hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just nicer than the feeling of the
metal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it fits like a pen or
something, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I brought myself a little bit of
headband rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this has gotten a little bit dark,
but ooey gooey.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was made from some nice, nice bubble
hash, and the bubble hash was very dark.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not overly surprised that we've got
a pretty dark product here, but I'll tell
[SPEAKER_10]: you, this product is strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got ourselves a nice rip there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This might be my last D-Nail or non-D-Nail
session on the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really close to getting the D-Nail
hooked right up to the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll probably end up asking for an
extended whip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd even put it right here in the front so
you can just plug in the whip like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's give it a shot, shall we?
[SPEAKER_10]: So nice big torch, nice offset bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a big torch, I mean a nice,
a decent size flame coming off of this
[SPEAKER_10]: thing right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to see when you're out
inside of the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it a little bit of a seasoning the
best I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm gonna have people, oh,
you didn't even season it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, I don't need to hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Torching it up real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get it nice and seasoned for you,
okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Change that color.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, it's going nice and purple
as I torch it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it the best seasoning that I can,
because I sure don't want to taste any at
[SPEAKER_10]: all metal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is why we season the nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it nice and poiple.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, she's turning nice and purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess probably this wasn't the best bowl
for me to choose when I'm damn near out of
[SPEAKER_10]: propane, or sorry, when I'm damn near out
of butane and the torch is running quite
[SPEAKER_10]: low, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's nice and purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she's off gassing anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just continue to hit it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get those purples to come in.
[SPEAKER_10]: What they do is they kind of come in,
the purples, and then they disappear.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of that is what we would call the
seasoning of the nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want that any leftover.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see my nail went completely
purple, and now she's almost clear again.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it a last little base to clean out
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty impressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is pretty much the first well,
I don't really even have a torch nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is one of my first nails I've
actually had to season.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the time they, I use the D nail on
such a low temperature.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, what I would do is I'd hook the
nail up and turn the D nail way up,
[SPEAKER_10]: and that seemed to do the job.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've never actually done this with the
torch to season her out, but she looks
[SPEAKER_10]: clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: More importantly, she smells clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's starting to go pink now a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seasoning of the nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Derps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool down a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So nice to have you guys out here again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to be doing a lot of
boat sessions this summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The boat's right on the dock and it takes
me all of five minutes to leave my house,
[SPEAKER_10]: get in the boat, and then be out in the
middle of the water, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: surreal.
[SPEAKER_10]: No one around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that carb work good?
[SPEAKER_10]: Unbelievable taste on that headband.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually taste it like in your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just tasting in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_10]: It lights up these taste buds that are
deep, deep down in your tongue.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can feel it like the taste of it right
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it almost reminds me of the taste of
like the first time I ever had dank.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first time I ever smoked weed that was
like, Oh my God, this is just the most
[SPEAKER_10]: amazing taste ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: You all remember that feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all had it where we've, you thought
you knew what good herb was, and then
[SPEAKER_10]: someone gave you the absolute chronic fire
and you hit it and you have this minor
[SPEAKER_10]: epiphany, almost a religious experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much what I'm talking
about with this right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was so God damn tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very glad I seasoned off the nail,
got rid of that little coating that was on
[SPEAKER_10]: there and you could smell it the tiniest
little bit, but I'll tell you that hit was
[SPEAKER_09]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I'll tell you, it tasted like another
one and another one and another one and
[SPEAKER_09]: another one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what that tasted like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he has a little kind of view of the
house sound here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got the mainland that attaches to
Vancouver and that goes down and then you
[SPEAKER_10]: see this little island right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Boyer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then between the island, you can see
there's a ferry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that ferry is coming from this island,
which is called Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just this part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That other little part is a different
island.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then beside that, you've got Keats,
the flat one in the background,
[SPEAKER_10]: which you can barely see is the Sunshine
Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this giant right here,
like it's a big one, is called Gambier.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gambier has a little friend at the end
called Anvil.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the mountains in the background are
the mainland, but the front one,
[SPEAKER_10]: Anvil, this big front one, which is not
the one in the background, that tip that
[SPEAKER_10]: you see that's a little on the bottom half
of it, that's actually the mainland again.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Elphinstone National Park on the
Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a little bit of a house sound lesson
there for you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna just float around here for a
little bit, maybe read my book,
[SPEAKER_10]: puff some more bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got D420K coming down on the Harley.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure we're gonna end up going and
having some fun either biking,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe heading up to Squamish, maybe
getting out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we will make sure that we share some
of it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We enjoy you guys and we're happy to have
you guys watching Bubble Man's World and
[SPEAKER_10]: D420K's channel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep watching.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right guys, I've just picked up D420K
on the dock.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, this is him, not a three
dimensional hologram.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all D420K and Bubble Man today.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna be ripping around.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might see some other friends and folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna go look for some marine life.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might even get on the Harleys and rip
up north.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where this video's gonna go,
but I believe it's Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't we puff?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, it's Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then we'll do a puff Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna head over to that island over
there and get the rig out so D420K can get
[SPEAKER_10]: his wake and bake on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I woke up this morning to about
six texts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you at?
[SPEAKER_08]: What you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were gonna be here this
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I laid back down after about an hour
because I was up late.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I got more texts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought the morning was,
you're coming up the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got up, cleaned my mother,
my mothership fucking right up proper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then packed my bags, grabbed a couple
of wicked sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vegetarian one for my buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a meat one for me because I'm a meat
eater.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking A, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even rip before I left.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 11 still.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess that's considered morning,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's afternoon is after 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's before noon, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are still in the morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna head over to Boyer and we'll
catch you when we get there.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're kind of in this little pool of water
that is trying to hide from the wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: The wind is wicked strong coming in from
the south up north.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're what, 20, 30 feet off the
shoreline?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, we're more than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 at least.
[SPEAKER_08]: 50?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I like to hear, Darren.
[SPEAKER_08]: Forged this shit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: First hook of the day for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm doing a nice big rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wake and baking.
[SPEAKER_10]: This might be the last you have to hear
that annoying sound of the torch because
[SPEAKER_10]: we're going to try and get the D-nail
working in the boat real soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once that's happening, I doubt I'll be
pulling the torch out again.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is nice that we're kind of locked in
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Using the carb cap dabber combination.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big fucking rip, D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cleaning my bowl off for my last hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: One nice thing about the torch is you can
just clean that nail till it's literally
[SPEAKER_10]: like dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a nice rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost should have turned my back.
[SPEAKER_10]: I lost a good portion of mine right off in
the wind, but I smelt it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The headband.
[SPEAKER_10]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasty fucking rips, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to do a little bit of a
combination sort of fun stuff day today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to get on the Harleys
and do the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do a little combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that'll be a little bit different
from our last video where we just
[SPEAKER_10]: literally booted all around the sound and,
you know, from Gambier to Bowen.
[SPEAKER_10]: From Bowen to... Yeah, no, I was watching
it earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had it right on the front and it was out
balancing on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so scared about these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, before I got these, I didn't
want to smoke out of these because they're
[SPEAKER_08]: so expensive and good looking.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good thing to always take off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I find that when it's left on.
[SPEAKER_10]: That you forget it sometimes because it
looks like such a piece of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen them get moved real quick by
people and those kind of blow off.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I've done that and actually forgot,
it's been so good up that it's stuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to heat it up to pop it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we're pretty close here now,
hey?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how close would you say that is?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say that's a good 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 feet?
25.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to move us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know, don't collapse into the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: It says it's only a few feet deep here as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 feet deep, 70 feet deep, 50 feet deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see no bottom activity.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not that easy to see bottom
around here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if... One of these times I'll
have to dive down and see if I can touch
[SPEAKER_08]: the bottom and bring up the rock.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's only like 200 feet some spots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're going to do that,
I'd bring you over to a spot that was like
[SPEAKER_10]: five, 600 feet so you could really impress
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really impress us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd come up like a big old red snapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: My guts and everything would be popping
out of my fucking mouth and my eyeballs
[SPEAKER_08]: would be blowing up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, good times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too much wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too much wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got too much wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't we...
[SPEAKER_10]: head around this island a little bit and
see what we can see.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might see a little bit of... see a
little bit of goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: D420K out on the boat doing OFZ dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can see what he's got going on
there, his OFC carb cap is his dabber.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we aren't claiming originality here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just saw other people doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I seen someone do it and I thought,
fuck, that's what those are for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something to stick your dab to and
put in the bowl right down to the thing
[SPEAKER_08]: and bam, you're fucking in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of taking your dab tool,
dabbing it in, putting it down,
[SPEAKER_08]: grabbing this, putting it on, stick your
hoot to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget who I seen it off, seen it,
but I seen it on the Facebook and it was
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just clicked.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clickety-click, mothership fam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Optimum flavor zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found that out too.
[SPEAKER_08]: OFZ.
[SPEAKER_08]: Optimum flavor zone-age.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude-age.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you're filming and I'm dabbing,
so... Ooh, yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the clarity on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy bazooka.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice, very nice, very nice,
very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you can see it in the sun
there, but he's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we've got this, we've got that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did we do with the whole shot?
[SPEAKER_10]: The big shot?
[SPEAKER_10]: She's right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just add that over to me when
you're... It's probably a good idea,
[SPEAKER_10]: hey?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go low.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing it underneath, yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hard times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hard times doing this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna go for the sort of dual cab it
up as you dab it up sort of thing here.
[SPEAKER_06]: See if I can get this right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, that tastes so really delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprisingly great flavor off of that
titanium.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a tiny little bit of difference
from the quartz, but it's really
[SPEAKER_10]: surprising what a great hit you get off
that Thai nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seems like the wind's almost died down a
little bit deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still recovering from the last rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys, so we just made it here
next to this giant military ship and it
[SPEAKER_10]: looks like they're having some sort of a
little meal on it or something at the back
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of officers and nice outfits
and stuff all sitting at nice tables and
[SPEAKER_10]: such, so kind of a cool little thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big ship.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of that, D?
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking neat, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the size of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a couple picks?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, holy shit, the back deck is
hundreds of feet long.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if they're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_10]: In a perfect world, we would roll up and
we would be the dab crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd be like, hello, yep, dab crew
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here to deliver the dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd put down a fucking hoist.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd pull up of our motherships.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck, that was a bit of an adventure
driving over here, wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got into some gnar there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was from the ship doing a
little bit of a turn.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see how the wood out there is
disappearing and then appearing and then
[SPEAKER_10]: disappearing and appearing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we really have to watch out
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look behind us, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's a few puffy little clouds.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty beautiful, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess we'll truck over and maybe
go to check out Pam Rocks where all the
[SPEAKER_10]: seals hang out and see what they're doing
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a float and maybe another dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: A float and a toke.
[SPEAKER_10]: A float and a toke.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so we made it to Pam Rocks
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: See, we got a little bit of seal action on
the Pam Rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about the shady camera work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard when the boat's moving to do
good camera work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm only willing to go so close
because this is the ocean and there are
[SPEAKER_10]: all sorts of other rocks up in and around
this area.
[SPEAKER_10]: We could go a little closer to these ones
over here, though, if you guys like.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been crying out for this many
thousand years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their vibrations are traveling through all
the surf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crying out for unity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Marcus said.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Garvey said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for those of you who read the book,
they call it prophecy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the prophet said.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they all said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so we are packing up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just got to the dock.
[SPEAKER_10]: And shit, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like I'm a ninja, partly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Partly ninja.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we're going to get on the bikes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get off this boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sure was a great day, though,
out there, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the clarity on the water near the
rocks here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see the big fish down there swimming?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over to the rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see those little ones?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's big ones in there, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, guys, so we've made it from the boat
to the bikes, the bikes to my house.
[SPEAKER_10]: We realized that I didn't have the GoPro
completely charged.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we wanted to take you with us on some
of that ride up the highway, because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, everywhere we've been today has
been beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the Zastro Boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The mother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mother nature at her best.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's just loving life.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet skunk behind you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congolese behind me.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we figured we would do a dab
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got the ninja nail right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually got a trio of ninja nails right
here with the mothership plugged in using
[SPEAKER_10]: the super high end five gallon bubble bag
bucket to hold the mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: Made with recyclable plastics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure people will be commenting on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I offer you a rip there, D?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gladly take a rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I still love not having to turn on a
torch, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a big torch fan.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really have to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, they're necessary when
needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they sure do fucking make a lot of
noise.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I didn't eat them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the idea of the D-nail just being
on all the time wherever I am,
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever the situation is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom, there you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: D-nail action.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice dabber.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to bring up my D-nail
and get that case off for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The zebra wood.
[SPEAKER_08]: The zebra wood, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes with it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of drops by the D-nail guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's number 37 or 137 or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we figured we'd do a couple of dabs
here before we got on the bikes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take a little rosin check.
[SPEAKER_10]: After all that boating, you get a little
bit of a wooziness.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really look forward to riding them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love riding with Darren.
[SPEAKER_10]: We ride right beside one another.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't really do the front one behind
the other kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll rip up here to Squamish.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bet you we do it in about 20,
25 minutes tops.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that should be fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.
Greasy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Greasy, rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Still working though.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of amazed actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: That pulled it off that warm, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Such flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: That headband is killer.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm hitting some different OG
nebula.
[SPEAKER_10]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the stuff right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, GoPro's pretty much charged up.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bikes are waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've got dinner arrangements for
later.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we should probably rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we should.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a good quick, quick rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I say stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stick to life's course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two days that come, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seasons pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man and man give thanks, I say.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be here on this journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I and I are on.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I want you to stop the way you're
living.
[SPEAKER_05]: Change your ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start over.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much, so much to be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Won't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on your mark, get set, and get ready
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting from A, B, C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, let's make it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting from one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematics, it no lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Age of children, I night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the voice of truth remains the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, today, today as yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: It never changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: As the message and the word you've never
heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It remains the same unless time changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harsh reality of life come home to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not hearing the message in the
words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you see the rest of my words coming to
pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on your mark, get set, and get ready
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting from A, B, C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, let's make it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting from one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematics, it don't lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So judge your sons and daughters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's unite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Play your part.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't let them sell you a six for a
nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't let them sell you no nine for a
six.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see them so sublime that they will
foist it upon you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will give you water to carry in a
basket.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on your mark, get set, and get ready
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're starting from A, B, C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, let's make it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting from one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematics, it don't lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, play your part now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play our parts now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge your children a night now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow the truth now.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right guys, we just made it to Lynn
Canyon in North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever been here.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna be fucking stoked,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an epic, epic place.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a suspension bridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got some cliff jumps that can be
done.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's really beautiful trails.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only one downer part is there's
definitely gonna be a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So knowing Dee and I, with the sessions
that we're gonna wanna have, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: have to go off the beaten track.
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem, we'll bring you with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are constantly off the beaten path.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, these will be the types of signs we
see here.
[SPEAKER_10]: At Lynn Canyon, because this place is
fucking extreme.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does this say?
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme danger.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a cliff right here, like about 800
feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So many, many, many people have died here
at Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you can die even just sunbathing in
Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a rock down here that has,
it's got like a plaque on it where a woman
[SPEAKER_10]: was just, you know, sunbathing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the rock released off the mountain and
landed right on her.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was her spot where she never left.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're into the busyness now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, look how fucking busy it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, we're gonna have to wait a little
bit, because people don't, this is insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Baden Trowell to Dempsey Road,
and it's a 15 minute trail.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not gonna take it, but I figure we
might as well head over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we got Baden Powell Trail, we got Lynn
Valley Dempsey Road, one kilometer,
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 meters.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Grouse Mountain Skyride,
that's 10 kilometers in three hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And 11 hours to get to Horseshoe Bay,
35 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some people standing over there
on the other side of the cliffs.
[SPEAKER_10]: See her?
[SPEAKER_10]: She's doing photography, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we checking this out, Dee?
[SPEAKER_10]: This seems to be the place for us,
eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Really quite nice little trails.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if we're gonna be able to hit
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if we'll get down that low,
but if we do, we'll hit some bowls down
[SPEAKER_10]: here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Such a fucking sick little trail,
eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking some of that intense heat from the
sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful down here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I think this is it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Might be a way to get over the fence.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's try.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it might take us down to the
water, it might not.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a big, big ass fence right there,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, probably what a lot of people do
is they just jump over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a path right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_10]: Spot number one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jumping over fences.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna put D420K on just in case.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in case I do a header?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in case you tank, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, fuck a duck.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a whole crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's head over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's head over to this one, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gonna have to go to the water and...
[SPEAKER_10]: Never come down to this part of the
canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always gone around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty nice little pools.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bon rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bon rep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, you have to tour us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we'll set this up on a tripod and
have a little session.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pause it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in Lin Valley, Lin Canyon Valley.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a beautiful, like, I can't even
express how amazing it is in this little
[SPEAKER_10]: area.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were gonna take you guys over the
suspension bridge, but instead what we did
[SPEAKER_10]: was we came down the staircase,
as you saw, because you were with us,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we found a bunch of kids on the rocks
behind us.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see them between us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're doing little cliff jumps and
stuff into these pools over on the other
[SPEAKER_10]: side.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got all of our gear.
[SPEAKER_10]: We managed to bring the dabbers,
the fucking torch, the bowls, the pipes,
[SPEAKER_10]: the fucking tripods, the cameras,
the batteries, the cards, the keys,
[SPEAKER_10]: the everything, and we have enough for a
dab each, so I guess let's fucking get to
[SPEAKER_10]: it, D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's serious fucking torch right there,
bro.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get that nice and orange hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what's gonna be louder right
now, the torch or the water behind us.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's raging pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Loud-wise.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, boss.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, mon.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll give that about a 20 to
30 second little spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see some of these monster
boulders, but things balancing
[SPEAKER_10]: precariously.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be nothing for someone to walk by
that thing and for it to release,
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very fucking important to be aware of
your surroundings up in this area.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very proper.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was proper.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanna heat that up and I'll get you
sorted?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna let the dabber cool down so I
don't mess up getting all of your hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna clean this up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure if that was just gonna be
smear or if it was actually like a big hit
[SPEAKER_10]: in that corner and it was a nice big hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we got a hit each.
[SPEAKER_10]: A nice hit each.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing too shabby.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab's the D420K by the river.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fucking spectacular.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bunch of people in there right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all going for some jumping,
so.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably gonna sit here for a bit and be
baked.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna go back up to our bikes and
get the rest of our hash so that we can
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe try and hit a bowl on the suspension
bridge if we can.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You camera or other way around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, I got one other spot I wanna
take D to, so we're gonna get there soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're here on the top of the Lynn
Canyon suspension bridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: We finally got it so it's empty.
[SPEAKER_10]: D420K's right behind me and we're fucking
heading over this bad boy, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been on here in a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice to see the bridge empty, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the waterfall one.
[SPEAKER_10]: 60 to 70, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even wanna look down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And look at this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's walk a little further.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's completely psychotic.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a little mini prosumer model.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how tall is that one?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts up here,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my thoughts are absolutely blank.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely blank, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just nice and serene and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty fucking sweet, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: The sun's sure mucking with my lens,
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of dirt on this lens and
it's all catching in this bad light.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's recharging is what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't really think about anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should head out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hear that?
[SPEAKER_10]: We said nothing's prohibited so we can
climb over the fence anywhere we want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's what I asked them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just wasn't sure if the rules
had changed on that or if that was still
[SPEAKER_10]: the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, totally nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Park Rangers.
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes to show it's the sort of DC vibe,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a great job.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get to spend the day in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you recording?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said the one guy had lost 17 pounds
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just walking, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they got these beautiful
boardwalks set up throughout this place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how quiet does it become within,
like, a few hundred feet?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even less than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get heavy if you want to go up,
up that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this is the way I always went to,
Twin Falls.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can go have a dab at Twin Falls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take these guys for a little hike through
the forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see the pathways that lead still
into the forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be able to use my dabber,
though, to carve it in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it says we're in an ecologically
sensitive area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to help protect it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that ripping around?
[SPEAKER_10]: Those squirrels?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, look at them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tree tiger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just having a blast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tree tiger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just ripping around, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Tree, tree tiger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I'm loving life on these boardwalks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some sweet, sweet fucking sweet digs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It used to be all rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was much easier to twist your ankle
or trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the bench.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the greatest metaphor for
life.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get out and get what you put into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to have a bench right in Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the power, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the power and the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just don't have water right nearby.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I said that, I saw an empty bottle
in the...
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, go grab that bottle.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a piss jug, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not touching it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking piss jugs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly Ricky and Julian have been here
earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's all about the piss buckets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Piss jugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, did we get off the path here?
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what it used to be more like right
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of naughty roots and shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Naughty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naughty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super naughty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I think this might be the spot
where we're gonna jump out.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I am correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear it's been 10 plus years since I've
been here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, this is where I used to climb down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Although we can go down lower.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have to go from here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I used to.
[SPEAKER_10]: See how there's a little thing that goes
right into this river runoff?
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to follow it right down.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a better spot up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a good bench for puffing on too
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where the old trailer used to come
from.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: This one fits just right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_10]: we've officially stepped over the chain
link fence and we're into the gnar.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I don't know if it's this way we
want to go or that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to try one way and then if it
denies us we'll shut her down and try
[SPEAKER_10]: another way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially carrying this fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we got to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking so beautiful in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you can do is you can jump.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about your only real option right
here to get down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gotta be 20 feet so I'll have to
climb back up the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up D?
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty sweet looking pools, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: I might do a periscope right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, look at how awesome this is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that is epic.
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta love BC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool that we're at Lynn Canyon
because we've never been here on
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubbleman's World before and it's one more
cool spot for you guys to notch down on
[SPEAKER_10]: your little calendars, bucket lists,
one day to get to BC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come to Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cool air that's ripping up this canyon
right now is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can kayak up this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do cliff jumping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these pools are 20, 30 feet deep
and they're pretty safe for jumping.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one more epic spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go check out D on the bridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so we skipped the bridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the bridge right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go, we're going to go down
below.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll hole in the fence.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one was easy,
huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: The old hole in the fence.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, look at this for a lookout.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know dude, this might be the spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We sit down low.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put this up high looking down like this
at us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't interrupt those kids.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though you might think you were
calling for the opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, we're doing great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to carry that?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have both hands?
[SPEAKER_10]: It gives you both hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you need one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like hard to argue with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could definitely make an argument for
it, but.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, this is pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fucking sick indeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess you can go right through here
or right down through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're going to do that I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flat surface of the world.
They're living.
They're living.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stop where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_05]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goes by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn your stars around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some nice pools here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me tell you, that was close,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely getting pushed over by this
giant rock.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be interesting to see you
make this corner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it is tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to get down.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit lower maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we are at the headwaters.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just beautiful, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lin Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crystal clear waters.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people hanging out up there,
but by all means, we can hang out down
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't we do half our session here and
half our session at that crazy waterfall
[SPEAKER_10]: view.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we found our spot, D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_10]: More rips for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll hold the banger if you like.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll go great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll do it proper.
Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might not be able to hear us very
well, so I'll talk up loud as I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are at the bottom of the Twin Falls
waterfalls in Lin Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we decided to have half our session
over here by the nice calm waters.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to climb up a little
ways up where the lookout was down to the
[SPEAKER_10]: waterfall.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have a hit there too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we start with this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this you or me?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's me first.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wicked cool in here too, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost forget what a hot day it is out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be surprised.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I like the cool in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get to heat up like it was
perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get one of those for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: So beautiful in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really spectacular.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nicer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely nicer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Adds to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Adds to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're now perched on a little lookout
about 50 feet over this Twin Falls.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: What he's saying is he's just letting it
cool down real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we might forget.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we talk towards the waterfall,
you might not hear what we're saying,
[SPEAKER_10]: but that's all we're saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another epic spot in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going into the cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're walking on the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going into the cave.
This
[SPEAKER_10]: is climbing up the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where he's going for a jump.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's putting some stuff in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's walking out on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sitting on the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now he's getting up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jump, jump, jump.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're watching.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like he's lowering himself down into
this little
[SPEAKER_10]: stash nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was pretty epic down by the
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the bridge that was down above
where we were looking down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we're going to climb out to the
bikes and go hit the road.
[SPEAKER_10]: So feel free to join us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme danger.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so much easier than the way here.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Time to get on the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another day in the life of a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he doing good today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he trying?
[SPEAKER_05]: To change his ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, everything takes time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, I want you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.

[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The life of a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is he trying?
[SPEAKER_04]: To change his ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to change the ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety-two years here in up this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Between this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like old ones, one knows yet to know soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking in the breath of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can use the breath of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: For either this or that.
Life's never free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The life of a man.
Is he doing good today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is he trying?
Boy, I want you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another day.
Just another day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The life of a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another day.
