[SPEAKER_13]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we better go live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can't get this going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Public.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let us do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow, we got people popping in left,
right and center.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't even gone live yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the new way to do things in 2020.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just setting up the YouTube meeting,
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: It should go live here in a second.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will introduce you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully we're all gravy, a little bit
rusty on this 2020 Hash Church first of
[SPEAKER_13]: the year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just waiting for Zoom to, ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Set up the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'm going to link that into the
old YouTube chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I will get to, here we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: And boom, there you guys go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can hear you great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack is on mute.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I have it set up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you come in, it automatically
mutes you.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool to have both of you guys in
first because you're kind of my,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, at chance been a frontline guy
for a long time at Berkeley's patient
[SPEAKER_13]: group, you know, you know, doing,
doing the good, good work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack has also now, how many years has it
been, Jack?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that I've been doing this work.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been working where I am for about the
last five years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you want to give us a little bit of
a low down on what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause Jack's, Jack's new to you guys,
but Jack is certainly not new to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack and I go back far, like 20,
20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_13]: We worked in the cannabis industry
together.
[SPEAKER_13]: I came out from Winnipeg and I met him and
we just kind of clicked right away.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was kind of a little bit of an
aggressive character at the time,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of Winnipeg ask and made me
feel like I was at home and give him a
[SPEAKER_13]: little low down on what you've been up to,
you know, obviously for the last five
[SPEAKER_13]: years, but also a little bit in regards to
how you got there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, well, thanks for the, thanks for the
intro Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely where Marcus and I met was,
was definitely the nineties in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_09]: when there was that, that time when all of
us were busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: From there, I, like a lot of people in the
business, I had my own, my own personal
[SPEAKER_09]: difficulties and through those,
I ended up leaving Vancouver and coming
[SPEAKER_09]: over here to the island.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did that quite a while back and in
trying to, you know, heal myself,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I did a lot of things that
involved cannabis and at the same time I
[SPEAKER_09]: ran a volunteer based mobile needle
exchange in the streets of Victoria.
[SPEAKER_13]: So tell them a little bit about kind of
how you went down the road and got into
[SPEAKER_13]: drug addiction and where you ended up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause that really sets the story.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I'm sure it might be a little bit
sensitive to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to share everything,
but get into that a little bit because
[SPEAKER_13]: dude, you lived some serious shit that
really, in my opinion, led you to do the
[SPEAKER_13]: work that you're doing today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for me, just like a lot of people,
I think I came out to, to BC from,
[SPEAKER_09]: from Ontario and I, I got out in a
cannabis scene, like, like any 20 year old
[SPEAKER_09]: who wants to go out and make their own
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I became very successful at that as
how I, how Marcus and I met.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once you kind of get to a certain
level in the cannabis world, you're no
[SPEAKER_09]: longer just dealing with people who are
only in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and through that, I found that I was
just not a happy person.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I got all the things in life
that I was supposed to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: physical things, things that I was taught
that would help me to, to feel better.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I didn't feel better when I had
those things, I turned then to the other
[SPEAKER_09]: drugs that, that I was involved with the
business of.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and that for a long time,
that made me stronger.
[SPEAKER_09]: That made me seem like a, like my average
friends, you know, and, and nobody really
[SPEAKER_09]: knew about it because, you know,
I was making enough money to, to,
[SPEAKER_09]: to hide what that was.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and I went on that way for probably,
you know, a solid, a solid decade.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I guess
[SPEAKER_09]: in that world I just experienced even,
even further traumas, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it made me want to do the things that I do
now to try to challenge what, what drug
[SPEAKER_09]: policy exists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I always felt like it was the
criminalization of cannabis that ended me
[SPEAKER_09]: up meeting into a world that I really had
no exposure to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up as a little hippie kid selling
hash to university students.
[SPEAKER_09]: And eventually that became such a,
a big thing that I was involved in the
[SPEAKER_09]: smuggling business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that involved, of course,
all the other things that, that,
[SPEAKER_09]: that, that come with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, for me, I always felt like
cannabis was always a healthy part of my
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was always something that I came back
to when I needed to, to gather myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, I don't know what else you
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, you know what, I guess that
was good, but it leads into, so listen,
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack had some problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: He got addicted to some drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I say he got addicted to drugs,
Jack excelled at being addicted to drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I saw him at the end, he was
literally on Maine and Hastings,
[SPEAKER_13]: like in the worst situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you, it's a death sentence
when you end up down there, very,
[SPEAKER_13]: very, very few people go down there and
come back from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So not only did Jack come back from that,
he started doing what he's doing in
[SPEAKER_13]: Victoria right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, that's what I was getting to
wanting you to tell us about with the work
[SPEAKER_13]: that you're doing now, based on the
experiences that you had using cannabis to
[SPEAKER_13]: help other people who are in your current
situation get back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that's, that's an easy story.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I basically, I came over here,
I was real quiet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in order to kind of get my own head
back together, I wanted to learn what it
[SPEAKER_09]: was to do something for nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I volunteered my time in a needle
exchange that served food and shit,
[SPEAKER_09]: because I wanted to find out what it was,
why people were nice to each other,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And through that experience, it led me to,
that was in a different health services
[SPEAKER_09]: agency.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I was called by this group called
Solid, which at the time only had one
[SPEAKER_09]: staff member and a shit ton of volunteers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And their story was like, a lot of their
members were, their story was very similar
[SPEAKER_09]: to mine, you know, where, so, so for,
for years, I just, we just did the mobile
[SPEAKER_09]: needle exchange.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went out and ended that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as everybody knows, the opioid crisis
is a, is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I ran an agency of, of people with
lived experience of, either current or
[SPEAKER_09]: past experience with drug use.
[SPEAKER_09]: And through that, we started doing
overdose prevention work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started the very first temporary
overdose prevention site here in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, and we kept doing more of the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we run the Harbor, the, that's the
equivalent of what you guys have in
[SPEAKER_09]: Vancouver is insight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And through running deep types of
projects, I've been able to show people
[SPEAKER_09]: how cannabis is an effective tool in a
harm reduction toolbox.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I'm running a needle exchange and
giving you clean needles, when I'm giving
[SPEAKER_09]: you Narcan kits, in case of the worst case
scenario, I also always wanted to be able
[SPEAKER_09]: to give people cannabis because for me,
that was the thing that always kind of,
[SPEAKER_09]: I never succeeded at, at government detox
or, or, or rehab centers.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I always succeeded when I gave myself
time and space and time to reflect in the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to be able to do that for
others.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we started just giving away edibles
and joints on weekends here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it started out with maybe only about 80
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were all street entrenched drug users
in the downtown core.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would always say to them,
you know, I probably know that you won't
[SPEAKER_09]: try this until that day when your dealer
wouldn't turn on his phone, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're really sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, and then, and then when that
happens, I really want you to take the
[SPEAKER_09]: edible and I want you to tell me what
happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we just gave out joints and,
and edibles within the, uh, within the
[SPEAKER_09]: scene.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we started doing a secondary stream
research with the university of Victoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I was to say, Marcus, uh,
tell me about your drug use and you tell
[SPEAKER_09]: me, Hey, I do an eight ball of cocaine a
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, then you would check in weekly to
let me know after a week of me giving you
[SPEAKER_09]: 80 milligrams of edible and a joint or
two, how that impacted your patterns of
[SPEAKER_09]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got a lot of very positive feedback
from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we expanded the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: We reached out to people who are large
online vendors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they started to give us a more product
to give to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we got up to having about 200
members and five days a week, four hours a
[SPEAKER_09]: day where the service, uh, was running.
[SPEAKER_09]: And about six months ago, we were able to
move and get a storefront that was
[SPEAKER_09]: separate from our administrative office.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I have a service open seven hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an at cost cannabis service for
members only.
[SPEAKER_09]: You either have to be a person of lived
experience with illicit drug use or on
[SPEAKER_09]: government assistance, like a disability
or old age or of Aboriginal descent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, those are the only people that add
into the program because those are the
[SPEAKER_09]: people who are most disproportionately
affected by opioid death totals.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that the community safety unit
has a complaint and has had from,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, for, for about the last month and a
half.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they still haven't come to us to give
us the lecture about shutting down because
[SPEAKER_09]: I am working in conjunction with the chief
medical officer here who is working as a
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of lobbyist with us, with the
minister of health, because the harbor and
[SPEAKER_09]: the other injection services that I run
have government exemptions that allow for
[SPEAKER_09]: drug use in those areas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously heroin is still illegal,
but where we work, it's accepted that that
[SPEAKER_09]: we have to pass drugs back and forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: There has to be an exemption that allows
for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am negotiating with the province to
extend that exemption over our cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: programs, to recognize that our cannabis
programs are an element of our life saving
[SPEAKER_09]: services that we provide.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also do other things like run a drug
drug checking project.
[SPEAKER_09]: So any person who does casual drug drugs
on the weekend or any, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: hardened addict has access to mass
spectrometry and real information about
[SPEAKER_09]: what's in their drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I run all of these services together in
one place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like that's the main reason
that my cannabis service has not been shut
[SPEAKER_09]: down yet is because I'm not a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you can come in and see that the same
thing that's $20 and the dispensary is all
[SPEAKER_09]: over the city is $5 where we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I have eight or nine staff that work
for me, uh, just in the cannabis programs,
[SPEAKER_09]: in the production, the attaining and
distribution of those things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only money that we make off
cannabis is that to pay the salaries of
[SPEAKER_09]: the people who are there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and everything else we give away.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've gone to where I've only,
when we started, we made maybe,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, a hundred dollars a day because
there is no price.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a donation.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you come in markets, maybe one day
you have no money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe one day you have $4.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some days you leave me money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some days you don't, but in the end you
leave the service with something every
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, that's, that's kind of,
uh, the, the, the loose parts of how it
[SPEAKER_09]: works.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I wanted you to come and share
this story because I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: good people in the community that will
want to get behind it and support it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know I've, you know, tried to
facilitate and do whatever I can for it
[SPEAKER_13]: because it really is the good,
good work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you are such a unique person to be
doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're literally, I just love you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, Oh, I wanted to see why people were
nice to each other.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like how honest is that?
[SPEAKER_13]: If people knew who you were 20 plus years
ago, it would just be like, wow,
[SPEAKER_13]: like this guy has matured.
[SPEAKER_13]: He has like grown as a human being.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been through hell and back and then
back to hell and back again.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're just kind of shining.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're doing super good things.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're helping people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can tell that your experience is
directly effective in the efficiencies of
[SPEAKER_13]: the program because you know what it's
like to be a drug user.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when you talk to them,
look, I know you're not going to be this
[SPEAKER_13]: edible, but you know, at one point in
time, their dealer is not going to answer
[SPEAKER_13]: their phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: That dealer is going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to lose that phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is the moment when those drugs
are not going to be available.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is the moment when you get that
edible and that joint into their hands.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just such a nice, it's just such
good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I'm really proud of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, and you're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the reason that I do those things is
because, uh, if, if I give you a joint in
[SPEAKER_09]: an edible today and next week you're,
you end up in jail and you get out and you
[SPEAKER_09]: have no ID, your welfare has been cut off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can help you with that too, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way, when you get those things
back together, you get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_09]: stable and, and maybe you, you need some
other kind of help.
[SPEAKER_09]: You feel like that you can ask us for
help.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's the strength of the
service and it's why that I connected like
[SPEAKER_09]: primarily we work from the health
authority contracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of what protects me in the
services that I've run is that I work
[SPEAKER_09]: essentially for the man in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then this, I love, I love the
opportunity about how, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_09]: anybody's ever been a drug user,
you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's a point when you're ready to
tap out and if people aren't ready to tap
[SPEAKER_09]: out, ready to help you at that point,
you kind of miss that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes months or years can go by
before somebody feels like they're in a
[SPEAKER_09]: position again, where they, they want to
make changes, you know, and recognizing
[SPEAKER_13]: those, that time is the key, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like who, but a drug user who's gotten out
of it can recognize it's the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is like a tool that allows us to
have that conversation every day with
[SPEAKER_09]: people, you know, when they come in for
their joint and they're edible,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can really have a chance to check in
with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can really have a chance to,
to make changes in their lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the ones that I've been able to make
for myself, you know, I just try to offer
[SPEAKER_09]: the supports that I wish would have been
there for me a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is why today for 2020,
I wanted to start with a story about
[SPEAKER_13]: realness and truth and not get right into
cannabis 2.0 and licensed productions and
[SPEAKER_13]: regulations and blah, blue, blue,
blah, blue.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I know that the majority of the
people that I invite into these rooms,
[SPEAKER_13]: although some of us, many of us are going
down these pathways and checking out
[SPEAKER_13]: alternative pathways, we still all come
from the foundation, from the place that
[SPEAKER_13]: you are in right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So know that in the Hash Church panelists
and the Hash Church congregation,
[SPEAKER_13]: you have an incredible amount of support.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, I would like to introduce
the Hash Church congregation because Jack
[SPEAKER_13]: and I got right into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have Etienne in the room as well
who came in right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Johnny B who's smoking a fatty
and taking dabs as Johnny B would be
[SPEAKER_13]: doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Mr. Skunk Man Sam looking very
dapper today.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you got a lizard on your head
today?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Colin is in from Vessel from Happy Valley.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's sideways today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why maybe he's got to turn
his phone sideways.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Wade is in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see his video on but welcome Wade
and welcome to the Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_13]: Medicine crew to Josh and Kelly are in the
house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Mark is also in the house and we'll be
getting into some pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_13]: conversations where I'm sure he'll be
dominating for at least an hour straight.
[SPEAKER_13]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get out your pens and your papers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then of course, my good friend and
colleague, Mike West is in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got Sebo Shen from Hanu Labs,
another great guy doing good work and
[SPEAKER_13]: opening great dialogues.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then another super righteous dude is
in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got Boo Williams in the house right now
and all I see Boo doing is good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just see him going and giving people
water and delivering food and giving out
[SPEAKER_13]: clothes and buying gifts for kids and just
like, so there is an incredible group of
[SPEAKER_13]: people in the room today.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna go for an organic
dialogue as per usual.
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone wants to chime in, feel free.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no direction to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank each and every one
of you for showing up today as well as all
[SPEAKER_13]: of the people who are watching on YouTube
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got almost 500 people watching live
right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Hash Church still got it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Jack, as somebody who has worked
needle exchange, thank you very much for
[SPEAKER_14]: your dedication and your hard work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you need people in the trenches,
especially those that have done it and who
[SPEAKER_14]: need it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you never know when it's somebody's
time and need.
[SPEAKER_14]: So people look for a needle exchange.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Help people out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do some volunteering and look at Jack.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jack, you need any volunteers to come
help you out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can they come find you and help you?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find our services, the Solid
Outreach Society at 1056 North Park in
[SPEAKER_09]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the side where our outreach office
and our cannabis services exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our administrative office is at 1804 Cook
Street just around the corner from the
[SPEAKER_09]: store.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess we always are looking for
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: The people of lived experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the first qualification before
anything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say, Jack, we've talked
on the phone quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great talking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Great to see you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really touches heart because I've
been down the path.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I talk with a lot of people here in
the downtown.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've worked at Network.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did talks at Carnegie Hall with Dr.
Warmbier on harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now we have Neil Magnuson doing
the same thing here in town with the
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis substitution project.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Neil's killing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's also got his show, Truth,
Hope, and Courage.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's really, really doing the same
focus of what you're doing here in
[SPEAKER_15]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're seeing this in different parts
of the world, actually, too, overseas.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some other people we've talked
about.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't think of the name right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's just great work that you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all support it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for bringing up Neil, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason that we started calling our
program the Cannabis Substitution Project
[SPEAKER_09]: because we hired a person from Van Du,
Howard Dijon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he came over and told us about Neil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how it really started is we
were just sitting like this, puffing on my
[SPEAKER_09]: couch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was telling the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just decided, I think I'll stop
selling weed and let's just start giving
[SPEAKER_09]: it away instead.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's honestly how it began.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're trying to do is make it so
that Neil and Sarah and other people who
[SPEAKER_09]: are doing the same, what we've done is
we've actually built a society.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a board.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a staff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have managers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can show on paper how that you create
cannabis at such a cost that you can
[SPEAKER_09]: employ people, but still give out hundreds
of donations into the community a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The chief medical officer here really
wants to make the program migrable,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, to migrate it to places.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to take all these extra tools
that I have with the research connections
[SPEAKER_09]: that I have and hand them over to people
like Neil and Sarah so they can expand
[SPEAKER_09]: their services.
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of like once a week having 700
people line up on Hastings to come get
[SPEAKER_09]: their thing from Neil, I want to give Neil
my playbook and say, here, Neil,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually make it so that there is this
subsidized area of the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Marcus said, there's people in this
forum who have the access to go and
[SPEAKER_09]: investigate the LP world as it sits right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: The people who I serve, they just know the
way that they could be served by that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to say like when I
volunteered at the Green Cross,
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a member of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was worked on donations.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when people come in with 50 cents and
we would get them some, it would be a
[SPEAKER_15]: bottom of the bag, whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: We always made sure that, and that is in
those beginning stages of working.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was basically harm reduction in
those first clubs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they all were based around.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we saw that and it was really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, and we saw it kind of fade away
with all of the legal dispensaries opening
[SPEAKER_15]: up and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But now we're starting to see that come
back because truly it needs to give back.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, I'm just sitting here on memory.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can keep going on with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know because it is kind of like what
Hilary did in the beginning and the kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of support that Marcus and others in the
community gave.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no way that Hilary could afford
the massage therapist.
[SPEAKER_15]: They couldn't afford the herbalist that I
went to and saw from there, stuff like
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went through those whole programs
because I was injured.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hooked on pharmaceutical drugs,
same thing, no difference.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went through the whole stages of the
whole harm reduction, learned the full
[SPEAKER_15]: pillars.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all with three through Sam
Sullivan, stuff like that with the
[SPEAKER_15]: downtown east side, what you're doing at
Van Do and all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there was a big part of that
between 86 and 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think you touched bases on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's when we started seeing that
explosion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because as you know, it's just
natural that people kind of corrupted the
[SPEAKER_09]: model.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was brought forward like a true
medical access because obviously the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: is a medicine and access, not giving
access is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to make sure that in the
changing landscape that is the LP world,
[SPEAKER_09]: that the people that I work with wouldn't
be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there would be space given to people
like yourselves, like myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: People like how did you like when people
would say to me, you know, how did you
[SPEAKER_09]: help solve the opioid epidemic?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what I would want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought people who understand that drug
policy is garbage, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And understand that problems are solved
from within community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when there's no solution to the
system, you require a new system.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why what you're doing is so
cool, man, because you're just doing
[SPEAKER_13]: something completely different.
[SPEAKER_13]: That actually works.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I knew people like yourselves would
agree and get on board.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: My biggest supporters so far, I hope they
don't mind me saying, has been the NCC,
[SPEAKER_09]: the National Compassion Club and Twisted
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those have been two companies which have
made it possible for me to have staff make
[SPEAKER_09]: it possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like give me, when I could say,
you know what, I need double the donations
[SPEAKER_09]: you give me for them to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it the adversity that you face that
made it so, like, why don't you just do
[SPEAKER_13]: what 90% of people do and just go online
and bitch and moan and cry about the
[SPEAKER_13]: system and how it's not really taking care
of you?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I just find it amazing why people
choose that over just like, you can make
[SPEAKER_13]: change by doing little things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that what you're doing is little,
but it started little and it's growing
[SPEAKER_13]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now no one can deny it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the most ridiculous thing to try
and deny that drug users can be helped on
[SPEAKER_13]: a, and not just helped on the level of
like how we used to say, oh, cannabis will
[SPEAKER_13]: increase the quality of your life,
you know, while you're doing chemo and
[SPEAKER_13]: while you're passing away.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it can actually shrink the tumors out
of existence.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can actually help you rid yourself of
these addictions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B, how much oxycodone were you
taking every day?
[SPEAKER_15]: 280 milligrams a day of oxycontin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fast acting super dolls and another 40.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_15]: My prescription drugs were 1,400.
[SPEAKER_15]: $288 a month.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hooked on heavy pharmaceutical drugs
that led into heroin.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went through these whole stages and
that's why it was easy when I started
[SPEAKER_15]: talking with Jack, when we started doing
this going back a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we touched bases, tried doing
things with the getting future,
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to get all these different little
mechanisms set up so we can actually
[SPEAKER_15]: supply germ rates to all these people that
were in need.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great feeling to see when people
actually give back and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like myself, I'm always trying to help
people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how to help people.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want people to just grow their own.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_15]: By starting a YouTube channel or working
with everybody and just kind of giving
[SPEAKER_15]: back as much as you can to the plan.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of the only thing that doesn't
create a gaping hole in your life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack said he had everything he had.
[SPEAKER_13]: He had every physical kind of thing he
required and he was left feeling empty,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, because that's not what makes
you feel great in life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, please catch this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I might even make a full screen just for
this one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was an important one, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Connection to other people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: The true value of life is not taking.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is giving and doing for other people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's giving and doing and helping.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is where you start to feel that warm
glow inside.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the more you do it, the better you
feel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, you have to be careful in this world
navigating because there are literally
[SPEAKER_13]: sharks out there that will consume you
whole.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not to say you can't help.
[SPEAKER_13]: Surrounded by them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can help.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, look at the work that this is
doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, the next thing that I'd love to
do that I think will be of the greatest
[SPEAKER_09]: benefit for both communities, the
community I serve and the community at
[SPEAKER_09]: large, is to start what I would call a
therapeutic space, which is actually a
[SPEAKER_09]: grow area.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to create like this Medi center
where you can have a place where you can
[SPEAKER_15]: grow your own and you have a place where
you can actually learn about cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: education, how to get off.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's got to be more of a place where
there's a place where people who truly
[SPEAKER_15]: want to learn and need and can't get
better.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are certain times, like I was
saying, we have legalization.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be nice to start seeing
those forms of extracts that I use every
[SPEAKER_15]: day that are going to be offered to
patients.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to be the biggest thing is
really is going to be those extracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's high concentrations of THC that
you know that we need that are needed for
[SPEAKER_15]: patients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do cannabis education classes and I
think heaven, the physical garden there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everybody here has been a garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know 100% the value of standing in
your room when the lights turn on and all
[SPEAKER_09]: the plants are praying.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what that does for you as a human
and I think to give that experience
[SPEAKER_09]: instead of just teaching people to come
and be needy and here's a joint and here's
[SPEAKER_09]: an edible.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to create a community where they
can come in and in the days they feel good
[SPEAKER_09]: enough to water a plant or pull some
leaves or whatever task it is that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: contributing to the medicine that they're
getting and then also for the community at
[SPEAKER_09]: wide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right for the grannies who think I can
grow four plants and I could do that for
[SPEAKER_09]: those people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then you can come into our community
garden and I could show you how to take a
[SPEAKER_09]: cutting and we could talk about how you
can give those cuttings away.
[SPEAKER_15]: We get people growing their own.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been saying it for so long.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is wrong for grow for just grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is our way to overcome some of
the shitty rules that exist in the LP
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if we band together as a community
to solve a problem that exists cannabis is
[SPEAKER_09]: it's health services, you know,
and if we could use the money from bat to
[SPEAKER_09]: help stem the toy the tide of the opioid
epidemic, then we can look at ourselves
[SPEAKER_09]: and and know that we help do that with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that I could really get
behind and and that's why I hope the next
[SPEAKER_09]: steps will be when we get ahead with a
little bit enough money that we'll be able
[SPEAKER_09]: to get this therapeutic area growing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to help you with that too,
because I I'm all about people growing
[SPEAKER_15]: their for and I started we got your for
.com.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want people to grow their own for
and I want to hook you up with everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make sure you got your own for
go to your hydroponic stores, buy your
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff, go to your bond shops like people
need to start growing their own because it
[SPEAKER_15]: gets you out of bed.
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see that life come out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the problem was I got a lot of people
who were so discouraged with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they were over water doing certain
things.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, with with a few good
people, we came up with a good little
[SPEAKER_15]: system that for plants with LED lighting,
you don't need AC units.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't need D Hughes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You might need to put in the humidifiers,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But education is the key.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Canada can grow for you go on Amazon,
go to grow store, pretty sure Wal-Mart,
[SPEAKER_15]: all these places are going to start
carrying different systems and stuff like
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like we we have twelve to
fourteen hundred members and growing every
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just think that times four.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you give me a five thousand plant count
and I'm pretty sure that we can pull an
[SPEAKER_09]: industrial space in the middle of downtown
Victoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bang.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can have four per household.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you come down to, say,
like apartment buildings or people I was
[SPEAKER_15]: looking at and see how people are living
with buildings that are full of people
[SPEAKER_15]: with HIV or different conditions,
then you can have one in every damn
[SPEAKER_15]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we can we can manhandle
rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I would I would love to challenge the
four plant in each household, because,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I have fourteen hundred members
who don't have households.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where the fuck you think you're
supposed to put that?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, where are you going to grow their
homeless, their whole household?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not everyone has a house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I drove around in 19.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was 2007.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in 2008 when they tore down my
house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had no place to live in my truck and all
I had was my one plant, Medi-Kuch,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I would drive around that in my truck.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's pictures of it, too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had nowhere to go with the plant,
but I kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I went into someone's bathroom and
stayed in there for a few days.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I carry this plant around with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I did a video on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was like, yeah, it's like,
where do you go?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was actually it was a part of my
life when I just got my license from
[SPEAKER_15]: Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: They tore down my house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was protesting, fighting WCB.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kept that plant with me because it
was the only strain that helped me so
[SPEAKER_15]: much.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would I remember being behind a cop
and putting it up on the dash so he could
[SPEAKER_15]: see it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just kind of I had signs on my
truck, Fight Works, ABC, and they kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: let it go.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: But always standing up for the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: That plant that plant got me through.
[SPEAKER_15]: It took me to so many different places.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cannabis community that joins and
holds you together was probably the
[SPEAKER_15]: biggest rewarding thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And walking into that lab with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: Memories.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2020 is going to be explosive.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: What we've seen happen over the last
decade and 2019 with legalization and
[SPEAKER_15]: everybody's complaining.
[SPEAKER_15]: About it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we say, grow your own.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, 2.0 is going to be a different
year.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to say, you know,
we really appreciate the work that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and we're backing you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing right now is we're
gathering the Dempire Collective,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a whole lot of farmers
internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just gathered as a meeting of the Mines
at Heartwood Institute in Garberville,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a really big topic of
conversation on how growers, producers,
[SPEAKER_01]: extractors, distributors, wherever you are
in the world, how can we touch
[SPEAKER_01]: compassionate care?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we touch children who need help?
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are financially struggling to
be able to reach the plant, to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to hook up and have conversations.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate meeting you in this
format.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've watched you lots of times,
you know, on the on the Church United
[SPEAKER_09]: Spill privilege that that Marcus would
would have me in because, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: usually this is a pretty high level tech
of weed, you know, a type of format
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was a little bit nervous to even
though this is the kind of shit that I
[SPEAKER_09]: have to do all the time for work,
you know, and it's just it's nice to hear
[SPEAKER_09]: back from the people who you've watched
thinking like, I know this can work
[SPEAKER_09]: because when I watch you talk when I don't
know who you are, I feel like that that
[SPEAKER_09]: you would want to help with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when that comes to fruition,
it gives me confidence that the ideas I
[SPEAKER_09]: had five years ago walking around picking
up needles on needle exchange and how to
[SPEAKER_09]: incorporate people in the cannabis
business into the unfolding landscape of
[SPEAKER_09]: changing drug policy and, you know,
how we could use the opioid epidemic
[SPEAKER_04]: to change the way we think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely a good thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you always kind of hear the
stories of what would happen if,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, you just couldn't go to Safeway
anymore and buy food.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what would happen would be that you
would definitely want to have a seed
[SPEAKER_13]: collection and start being able to grow
some food.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the best thing you can do is help out
others that can do nothing for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is the best feeling in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: Passing on love, passing on knowledge and
educating people that will only help them
[SPEAKER_14]: better themselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the best feeling ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really amazing what an incredible
catalyst this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it continues to catalyze and
point in directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, you know, is illuminating areas
that have been dark for a really long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illuminating big ag, big pharma,
you know, all of the problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: politics, polycorporatix is what,
you know, the word that I've been using
[SPEAKER_01]: lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that this plant is here
to save the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we are the medicine makers and
we are the people that need to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bring this plant out into,
you know, regular mainstream world so that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody can jump on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that you all know that this
cannabis culture is international.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we connect on a very, very deep level
only because of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a unique plant in the sense that
there is this underlining, like it seems
[SPEAKER_13]: to affect compassion and humanity and
empathy and really sort of produce it in
[SPEAKER_13]: people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one of the reasons why when
everyone's so concerned about like,
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, evil cops and lawyers and
judges all taking over the cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: industry, I'm like, bro, they are messing
with a power that is so much more powerful
[SPEAKER_13]: than any.
[SPEAKER_13]: They fought it for decades.
[SPEAKER_13]: They spent billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_13]: They destroyed tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, millions of lives,
[SPEAKER_13]: and they lost to a plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now they're going to lose again.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to try and make it
corporate.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to try and be greedy.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to try and do all of these
different things.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what they're not going to understand
is that while you're handling this plant
[SPEAKER_13]: and breathing it in and being around it,
it's going to affect the way you think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Promise.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_13]: We said it years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: My partner actually said it to me years
ago, Martin Rovchik, who was one of the
[SPEAKER_13]: founders of Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: Before Manitoba Harvest was started,
we were growing a five acre hemp field
[SPEAKER_13]: just experimentally in 1995.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just outside of Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was quite young at the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember I was maybe 21 years old or
something, 21 or 22.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said to me as we left the field in
my van and we kind of looked back and we
[SPEAKER_13]: had to hide the field.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, it was not right on the highway.
[SPEAKER_13]: But he said, you know, this is going to
change the way people think.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that wasn't even anything medical.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was just cannabis growing in acres in
the prairies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it truly did change the way people
think.
[SPEAKER_13]: They started seeing it at the grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_13]: They started consuming it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they're putting it into their
bodies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that affecting them?
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a very unique plant that is like
it's viral in the sense that it just gets
[SPEAKER_13]: out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And these people that think they're going
to cage it and control it, I think that
[SPEAKER_13]: they'll see it'll work about as well as
their prohibition did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mayan prophecy also states that a
flower is what is going to save this
[SPEAKER_01]: modern culture, these modern people,
a single flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a whole lot of sense to me
that this is going to be the thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: saves the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: On that note, D420K, can I get a?
[SPEAKER_13]: Bon rep, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, right on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack's got his little girl.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just in time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: For a little bon rep, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how long I've been waiting for
that?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just kind of created like the motto or
whatever it is, you know, between you and
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Mark with his, with his hash church
song.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was also pretty classic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty classic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really nice to be gathering with all of
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm being quiet right now because I'm
trying to put dry sift on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm just going to say aloha and
happy new years, everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy 2020.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, are you in Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on Maui.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was able to get legal cannabis here too,
because I have a, I have a California
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you submit to, to Hawaii,
which I did last Saturday night and on
[SPEAKER_14]: Monday, I had my card.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I actually went to the dispensary and
bought cannabis and carts and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff, just to see what their program is
like here on the island.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maine does that as well, just north of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really nice because it allows
people to, to check out different growers
[SPEAKER_07]: and different processors and really learn
about what everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I would say the cannabis here is
circa 2004, 2005, California.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's it's got a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: They, uh, they don't have many people
coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the cannabis seems to sit around a
while.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Turks and everything are gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: They store it in these bottles that are,
have a lot of oxygen and air in them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So like Canadian weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like all Canadian weed, like all of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, how is it bone dry in a
container that just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds familiar up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not bone dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: The prices are a little high, you know,
because they have to grow it and produce
[SPEAKER_14]: it on top of that, such as their oil here
is a black sludge because they can't use
[SPEAKER_14]: BHO or anything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it has that wonderful 2003 sludge
flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, on top of it on that, their dabbles as
well, or black sludge, because again,
[SPEAKER_14]: they can't use BHO.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a class three felony here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So in Hawaii, you need to work on your
laws here to get better medicine,
[SPEAKER_14]: but growers really just got to.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually use alcohol and do a
really fast wash in an ultrasonic machine,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: For 30 seconds or less than a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you come out with absolutely beautiful
golden oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear that Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such a boring problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a boring problem making light
colored oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just show your solvent down, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You could use filtration.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of ways of making nice dark
oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just says that, yeah, they're a little
behind.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's like they're bootstrapping it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, they're, they're still having
caught up to technology as well as I don't
[SPEAKER_14]: think they get out to the shows to see
what technology is out, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: much less what a roto vape is.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what about the actual cannabis culture
there Etienne?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you must know people that are like
born and bred live in there like that are
[SPEAKER_13]: growing beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Herbs and like, and I have beautiful herb
that is much better than what's grown
[SPEAKER_14]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've known people who've been living
here for decades.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I get good herb here and get a good
hash, but it's just the system itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two dispensaries on the island.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's only two grows and they have to
grow and produce what they produce.
[SPEAKER_14]: So not only do they produce it,
they have to extract it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to package it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to put it in the bottles and
then, you know, get a shelf.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's still very limited in supply.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten types of herb, three types of hash,
three types of cartridges.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not allowed edibles here,
which is different from when I got married
[SPEAKER_14]: in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_14]: They now are allowed to have concentrates
where they started off with edibles
[SPEAKER_14]: couldn't have concentrates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they have concentrates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas here in Hawaii, there are no
edibles.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a problem for people.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do have pills, which are popular,
but no edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also do allow home growing though.
[SPEAKER_04]: A certain number of plants, correct?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I think it's four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to take a minute to to big up
the Hawaii Cannabis Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dana Ciccioni and he just invited us to
come and we're going to be doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation on preserving aloha through
regenerative cannabis agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've been having unbelievable
conversations and we've seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful weed from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just at the Emerald Cup and the
Pakalolo farmers and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatives that are going on there and
all of the islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing a Dempure aloha
love tour coming up and we're going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: visit a whole bunch of farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the outreach is just massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go Kama'aina style.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go and visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to share some knowledge of the
Hawaiian culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of our original inspiration,
you know, was going to go into Kauai and
[SPEAKER_11]: being in the islands and natural farming
is a huge explosion and a wave of
[SPEAKER_11]: consciousness that's happening through
cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of that came into America from
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are a lot of amazing people on
Hawaii growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the system that's really kind of
bunk.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like, you know, having to be able to
it's actually kind of a blessing to be
[SPEAKER_11]: able to have an integrated system where
you grow and produce all your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there's more people involved,
you know, so you can get some,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, different products on the table,
that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like never before that community is
reaching out to the international
[SPEAKER_01]: community and it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mahalo to all the Hawaii listeners out
there and mahalo nui loa to the Hawaii
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Conference for inviting in
regenerative practices, businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, extraction.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, speaking of shout out, get Thermo Cup
and get Thermo Cup and much love to
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not coming in, but you know,
we were just at the Emerald Cup and met a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of the family from Hawaii and they
are, everyone is going to all the
[SPEAKER_11]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's just a matter of getting
everything in place and creating what you
[SPEAKER_11]: want.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the people have to speak up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to get down to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: one of these days.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely Hawaii, especially.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's just like a hop,
skip and a jump from Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a fellow named Chris Cole took my
class a couple of years ago and he's the,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, product manager at a place called
Maui Grown or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He seems to be pretty knowledgeable on
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it sounds like their hands are
tied based on what regulations regulation
[SPEAKER_08]: allows.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be interesting to see if they could
actually get decent rosin because I would
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly think that that would be
something that if BHO wasn't allowed,
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of like next best sort of flavorful
extract that's at high, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: terp extract you can get and in a pretty
safe process that doesn't involve
[SPEAKER_08]: flammable solvent would be bubble rosin,
no?
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's probably more of an opinion
than anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'll tell you, some of the
tastiest, terpiest, loudest shit I ever
[SPEAKER_13]: put in a pipe was Sam's Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think just because other people have
never seen it, they don't think it exists.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they say things like, oh, well,
live resins, the loudest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just for commercial production,
though, can that actually be something
[SPEAKER_08]: that's viable?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you actually make a product that way
reliably?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, Cuban Grower did.
[SPEAKER_13]: He seems to have a version of 99.9% It's
all relative to what your customers are
[SPEAKER_05]: willing to pay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very limited supply, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like wouldn't you want to have a,
you know, a more robust process,
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of like what you guys run?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main difference between Dry Sift and
Water Hash and flour rosin is Dry Sift,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get a very small yield from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: With water, you get a much higher yield.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, but the thing that we haven't
mentioned is that the way you grow,
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam, and your understanding of growing,
you're like a plant whisperer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your plants express themselves in a
frightening way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow biodynamically and organically in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: With sun, with sun, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Hawaii, they have a longer season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Hawaii, they grow really late,
narrowly drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produce fantastic product,
but it's not mass produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are growing small amounts of it,
but it's not mass produced yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll see one day maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Sam, I got a question around island
produced weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like a lot of the Caribbean
islands have very high calcium levels in
[SPEAKER_08]: the soil because they're basically coral
or volcanic, but there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there ways that you can counteract all
the calcium richness in island soils?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to raise the pH?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the pH or the calcium?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just a high proponents of
calcium in the soil just totally screws up
[SPEAKER_08]: some varieties, and they're trying to
solve that down in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Add microbiology.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't seem to have that problem in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's because Jamaica,
I'm not sure if it has to do whether it's
[SPEAKER_08]: a coral island or a volcanic island.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Caribbean islands are coral based.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has a higher coral reefs,
which then turn into limestone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's generally going to make more
basic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the nice things about the
tropics is there's world around in the
[SPEAKER_05]: tropics is cocoa core.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that is a big issue with
core is the salt ratio, but it is core
[SPEAKER_05]: does act as a good buffer for calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally dragonfly hit the head on
the nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at fungal dominant soils in
general, fungal dominant soils tend to be
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly more acidic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So throwing compost with a lot of cocoa
pith or cocoa husk is going to help buffer
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the calcium chloride.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compost and humic acid really makes a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: More mulch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mulch like your life depends on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Become a mound farmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like throw, when you think you have
too much on there, throw 10 times more
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff on top of it and create a mound and
you'll be... When you do mulch,
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch, there's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old mulch, it's called compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we say mulch is because
you're just putting the compost on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beds, on top of the plants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold compost is mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layer, layer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even on Jamaica, there's a lot of
different kinds of soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, you got red dirt, you got the
black dirt, you got the hard coral dirt,
[SPEAKER_11]: wet side of the island, dry side.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're on an island, you have to
really use, if you need to, different
[SPEAKER_11]: parts of the island for different
environments.
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite thing about Jamaica and
generally any island and watching new
[SPEAKER_13]: people be like, I'm going to go and grow
herb in Jamaica or St. Lucia or wherever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just like, well, have you ever
grown there before?
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of my prior life as an industrial
scientist, we did a wood decay study on
[SPEAKER_08]: the island of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: As it turns out, Hawaii is an ideal place
to study wood preservatives because of the
[SPEAKER_08]: fauna there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I noticed is that from one side
of the island to the other, the
[SPEAKER_08]: stratigraphy or the geography or the
geology, I guess that's the word I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Changed immensely.
[SPEAKER_08]: On one side of the island, we basically
needed a chisel to put stakes into the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: The island dirt or the soil was like so
hard and almost impenetrable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the other side of the island,
it was like floral and swampy and lush.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just so different that it was just
only literally, I think maybe about like
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 or 30 miles from each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just completely different geology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that known as the leeward?
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially in sailing, it has to do with
where the prevailing wind is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously if you're an island,
you get hit from a prevailing wind side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, it's in the Atlantic Ocean
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be facing the Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wind is that side of the mountain is
going to have most of the moisture picked
[SPEAKER_05]: up and then deposited on the leeward side,
I think it is, where the rain shadow sits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where the plastic ends up now
too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where all the straws and the
toothbrushes and the tampon wrappers and
[SPEAKER_08]: all the other disgusting shit ends up now
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam, what were you about to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying that when an island has a
mountain in the middle, like Kauai,
[SPEAKER_04]: so there's the north side and the south
side, the north side is much wetter than
[SPEAKER_04]: the south side, for example.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what it was, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of the islands, let's take
Antigua, for instance, who's got an
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting thing unraveling there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coral has a lot of calcium deposit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be best to dig up that soil and
amend it?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would your thoughts on going directly
in the dirt and using amendments be?
[SPEAKER_11]: I would a thousand percent just build
mounds on top of it and forget about
[SPEAKER_11]: what's happening below it because what's
happening below it's going to transform as
[SPEAKER_11]: soon as every worm in the area comes and
all the micro... Nothing changes
[SPEAKER_11]: earth-like microbiology.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of just like, oh, especially in
Jamaica, I mean, there's every kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: vegetation in the world, so what you'd
want to do is just get a machete and just
[SPEAKER_11]: get a stove and just start getting all the
different kinds of leaves and stuff that
[SPEAKER_11]: you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you find some goats around it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some goat manure on there along
with sticks.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's lots of sticks around and the
sticks are incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And banana trees are always constantly
shedding and banana trees are really
[SPEAKER_01]: prolific around any tropical area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were in Jamaica, we chipped up
all of the banana and the bamboo that was
[SPEAKER_01]: down on the ground that was fresh and the
brown, so we had a mix of green and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within two weeks, we were directly
planting inside of that chipped mass and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants just took right off.
[SPEAKER_11]: And most zones have little deposits on the
land somewhere of pretty decent soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can kind of layer that on the top
of whatever you've prepared as a bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can kind of use that as a starting off
point for your transplanting or even get
[SPEAKER_11]: some of the top soil off and kind of pull
it on top of the bed and sort of cap off
[SPEAKER_11]: what you've created organic matter-wise.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the plant grows and you just keep
doing it over the course of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could just take the material and
make like a hole like this inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: material, fill it with some nice dirt that
you feel like has a good proper ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good balance, and then plant a seed
directly into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time that the plant matures,
it's actually ready to consume those much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger breakdown of material.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the microbiology is breaking down over
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's interesting, you said,
I only have experience in Costa Rica
[SPEAKER_07]: growing actually crops in that particular
climate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's similar, but different because the
soil down there is very, the biology is
[SPEAKER_07]: very different, but it has its own
challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really, it's great to hear that
the layering technique is working for you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys in terms of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that, you know, I've gotten a lot of
questions from people in Antigua and
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have enough experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can have this dialogue here to share
that information.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I used to grow potatoes in
California, I would just put the potato
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes for the next crop on the ground,
cover them with about three feet of mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the potatoes would root into the
ground and just go right through the
[SPEAKER_04]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then afterwards I didn't have to dig
up the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had to pull the mulch off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of what I'm talking about with
mound life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's, it's kind of a mentality.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like you're, you're just a mob
gardener.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just, you plant as much as you can
on the mound and, and you use it to your
[SPEAKER_11]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_11]: It also saves water.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and these are not just techniques
that work in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, like we've, we've, we've gone
to Bali, Thailand, Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_11]: different places, Hawaii, all the islands.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going again to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we said, so we're really excited,
but these techniques are not really,
[SPEAKER_11]: they work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're walking, looking all down the West
coast to Michigan, to Maine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in Bali.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's working everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does change what you're layering.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, the biodiversity of your
bio region is what you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just not really needing to bring
amendments all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're using what we have there and also
plastic culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Mark mentioned the word plastic
and plastic is, is really killing the
[SPEAKER_11]: earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really sad looking at modern
agriculture use plastic so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, layering and using mulch is the
answer to plastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It stops weeds from growing and it builds
soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could go on forever about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're super solutions oriented,
but I just wanted to take one,
[SPEAKER_01]: one second to talk about a major problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp can save the world, but plastic
culture hemp cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that we become
intelligent on how we're planting this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly sacred plant that is what we
were talking about earlier, going to save
[SPEAKER_01]: the world is going to change people's
minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do it in a way that's
respectful to the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that will stop plastic is
for oil to get too expensive to make
[SPEAKER_04]: single use plastic until oil is expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have plastic forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's so sadly true, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Dr. Mark had some interesting
thoughts on plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last time we were on the show and,
and if Mark, if you can elaborate a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit, a little bit more on the,
on the knowledge you have with,
[SPEAKER_07]: with using hemp, you know, last time we
talked, you had some really interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: thoughts about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if you could share
some more of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like Mark is not with us at the
moment.
Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, did he bounce?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought he was the one talking about how
hemp plastic is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: He felt like it was viable.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had some very interesting thoughts that
are different than what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know enough about hemp plastics to
speak on it, but I I'm so fascinated in
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the problem that we have seen is that
there's no conventional recycler that will
[SPEAKER_14]: take the current hemp plastic that's being
made.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or at least like, I think it's Serna who
is pushing that currently.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the problem is we can get a ham plastic
tube.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is you can't recycle it.
[SPEAKER_14]: No recycling place would take it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a whole problem of the supply
chain still that these products are
[SPEAKER_14]: created, but the, they haven't figured out
how to break it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If hemp plastic is biodegradable,
you don't have to recycle it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, you know, put it in compost
piles.
[SPEAKER_14]: These are not compostable though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that then answers the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that makes compostable,
truly compostable is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that it's stuck together,
you know, what is emulsifying that
[SPEAKER_01]: together, which is polymers and the
half-life of these polymers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because you can't see it with a naked
eye doesn't mean that it's not just lying
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the soil and what they call
biodegradable, which definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, severely changes the
microbiology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you're having residual polymers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're, we're pretty messed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We, we start using our heads to start
trying to fix problems and create new
[SPEAKER_13]: problems and whew.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the intention was good.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it's still not done.
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have to work with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do they say about the road to hell?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good intentions, my friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that it's on a packaging S a N a,
um, Colorado is making different
[SPEAKER_11]: biodegradable plastics and hemp plastics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are really heady good packaging
company and packaging is a really
[SPEAKER_11]: important issue to talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even with hemp cultivation,
I mean, do we need, and in New York,
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's like, if there's a few
classifications for hemp, there's
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoid hemp and industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you live in Oregon, you might think
industrial hemp is the enemy, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can't have male or female plants
around.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you're talking about a food
source or you're talking about plastics
[SPEAKER_11]: instead of, you know, uh, polymers and
maybe there's polymers in the hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where's Mark, but,
um, yeah, we, we are needing to move
[SPEAKER_11]: forward with intelligent, um, agriculture
decisions and having industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: growing on earth is extremely important
for fibers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're wearing cotton and cotton is
still slave labor is being used to produce
[SPEAKER_11]: cotton all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we had hemp, more hemp textiles,
we would know where it came from and the
[SPEAKER_11]: supply chain of where it came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's all part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody's producing hemp
fiber in either Canada or America.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish that that, you know,
we could somehow chase the money from CBD
[SPEAKER_11]: instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp tailor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, big wide open prairies that are,
you know, growing canola or growing corn
[SPEAKER_01]: or growing, you know, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it would be really amazing to see a
lot of textile hemp going on in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about the machinery.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is Colin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying that there's a couple,
um, mills in New York state that are very
[SPEAKER_07]: interested in, in, in the, the material
itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for them, it's about, is there a
market for them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and how do they learn to, to work
within that market?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I know from, from talking
to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, uh, you know, I would love to see
more fabrics and things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Marcus, you had mentioned hemp tailor
that was hoodlum and I wear their jackets
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's not a hundred percent
hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a, it's a very nice, uh,
brand that's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been really embracing hemp and
materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's really expensive is processing and
the, and the factories that you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: build for processing, spinning and weaving
on multi-million dollar factories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got to have it within say 50
miles of the, where it's being grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be trucking the hemp all over
the universe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I know Taylor is working on a
project in the U S to produce fibers,
[SPEAKER_13]: grow them in the U S and, and produce
fibers and, and, you know, make,
[SPEAKER_13]: make products for sale.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the things that they're
trying to do in 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, when, when you look at the
evolution and deployment of hemp in North
[SPEAKER_05]: America, the, a lot of Europe as well as
Asia didn't ban hemp as heavily as North
[SPEAKER_05]: America did during prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many of the, many of the European
clothing designers continued to have
[SPEAKER_05]: access to hemp in forms of different forms
of canvas or hemp silk or silk blends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that hemp has slowly been regulated
here in North America, we're starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: see a lot of brands focusing on CBD,
but there are some brands working on
[SPEAKER_05]: either food or fiber or plastic prod
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue is, as like mentioned,
you know, you need to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your supply relatively close, you know,
within two to 300 kilometers and enough
[SPEAKER_05]: acreage being cultivated in order to,
you know, process and run that facility,
[SPEAKER_05]: that lumber mill, that fiber plant,
the cordicating line, or even seed line
[SPEAKER_05]: for seed oil processing and operate that
plant for 300 to 320 days a year in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, keep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been growing hemp for decades and I
don't know of anybody who processes hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: any factory, a primary processor that
processes hemp that's 300 or 200
[SPEAKER_04]: kilometers away, just isn't done.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it all has to be within 50 kilometers,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do we begin?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plastics, polymers, hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You covered a lot of ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Russians hacked my computer
and they didn't want me telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, hemp plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people out selling hemp plastic
right now are, you know, hemp is a source
[SPEAKER_08]: of cellulose, but so is switchgrass and so
is trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has to be economical.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not economical, it's difficult to
convince people to put capital investment
[SPEAKER_08]: into a business that's not going to make
money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has to be able to make money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sam hit the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I'll go back to something that
Sam had just said, which is as long as we
[SPEAKER_08]: have cheap oil and cheap petrochemical
sources, we will continue to create and
[SPEAKER_08]: make and use single use plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that cheap oil
unfortunately handicaps is the cost of all
[SPEAKER_08]: alternative energy, whether it's
windmills, dams, wave catchers,
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever you use them to generate energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the cost of that alternative
energy is pegged to the price of fossil
[SPEAKER_08]: fuels because of the infrastructure that
currently exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, and that's, you know, Walmart,
Amazon, the industrial manufacturing base,
[SPEAKER_08]: which uses a lot of petrochemical fuel
because that's the cheapest form of fuel
[SPEAKER_08]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the notion that we can somehow
turn hemp into fuel is really not based in
[SPEAKER_08]: reality at all because it actually
consumes more fuel to convert hemp into
[SPEAKER_08]: ethanol than it creates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're actually, it's a negative.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually uses more petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only reason why they can pull that
stunt off down in Brazil and places that
[SPEAKER_08]: are growing sugar cane is because they
have a lot of cane juice, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: enriched with sugar, which all you do is
you throw yeast in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the yeast makes the sugar poop
out ethanol.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, you could put ethanol in as a
liquid fuel down in places where there
[SPEAKER_08]: already is investment made into an
infrastructure to grow sugar cane on a
[SPEAKER_08]: shit ton fucking scale, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why ethanol can make a
solution down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But turning hemp into ethanol,
and I always see all these memes about all
[SPEAKER_08]: the things that hemp can do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And turning it into a liquid biofuel is
absolutely crazy and nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can get the seed oil, seed oils
can be burned, but it has such a more
[SPEAKER_08]: higher value as a nutritional product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you can do with seed oils,
as opposed to the lowest value of
[SPEAKER_08]: something that you just put into an
internal combustion engine or some
[SPEAKER_08]: generator to burn just for its fuel value.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the analysis has already been
done on biofuels.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is why you don't see cellulose
ethanol being produced today, is that if
[SPEAKER_08]: you take the same amount of cellulose and
rather than, think of cellulose as its
[SPEAKER_08]: high molecular weight glucose.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a glucose molecule, which is a sugar,
which it's a many, many different copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sees high long chains.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so think of that as stored sunlight,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it took a lot of energy by the plant
through photosynthesis to convert those
[SPEAKER_08]: photons into this long molecule.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the wonderful thing about cellulose and
cellulose derived from hemp is it's
[SPEAKER_08]: amazingly strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Depending on how you measure its strength,
it could be as strong as super high
[SPEAKER_08]: strength fibers like Kevlar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really, it makes sense to use the
hemp, not to digest it down to a sugar to
[SPEAKER_08]: feed to a yeast to poop it over into
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a tremendous capacity that exists
today in the world for grain derived
[SPEAKER_08]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need ethanol from hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stupid and it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: And because you can't make money doing it,
there'll never be capital investment into
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what there will be capital investment
into is where you can use the strength of
[SPEAKER_08]: the hemp fibers to reinforce composite
materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's sort of like where
hemp plastic is going.
[SPEAKER_08]: The current, if you Google hemp plastic
and you go to that site, what you'll see
[SPEAKER_08]: is that they're taking regular plastics
like polycarbonate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what my computer's made out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what my glass frame is made
out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Polycarbonate plastic, it's what CD-ROMs
are made out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Polypropylene, polyethylene, these are all
petrochemical derived polymers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they're doing is they're taking a
petrochemical derived polymer that costs
[SPEAKER_08]: about 25 cents to 75 cents a pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're adding hemp fiber in terms of
either heard or actually elongated fibers
[SPEAKER_08]: or oriented fibers to get the inherent
strength that those fibers give to the
[SPEAKER_08]: material.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you can use say rather a two inch
piece of plastic in that support versus a
[SPEAKER_08]: five inch piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're using less plastic because
you're using the strength of the hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: fibers to reinforce the plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem is that they're trying to
sell that plastic in competition with the
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 cent a pound plastic at like two or
five bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who's gonna buy an incumbent at two or
five dollars a pound?
[SPEAKER_08]: It still has petrochemical derived plastic
in it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But it has hemp in it, which I guess is
cool, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're lightweighting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the world will use less plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically what they're competing with
is one of the ingredients that's in their
[SPEAKER_08]: product, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's other fibers that you could
use.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's used quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of other fibers that can be
used other than hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what I've said on Hash Church a
few times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks for bringing it up because
again, it's just a reoccurring theme.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that things have changed
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's really gonna change I think in hemp
is not necessarily gonna be the CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's gonna be the fact that we
have to feed more people on less
[SPEAKER_08]: irritable, farmable land in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you have to raise protein per
acre to feed livestock, right now soybean
[SPEAKER_08]: delivers somewhere between 360 to 380
pounds of soluble protein per acre.
[SPEAKER_08]: With hemp, they believe the estimates are
somewhere north of a thousand pounds an
[SPEAKER_08]: acre.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when it comes to how do you use an acre
of land to most efficiently raise a plant
[SPEAKER_08]: that produces protein that humans need and
animals need in their diet, it will be
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp hands down as the winner.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you're taking on the likes of
Syngenta and Monsanto and DuPont and
[SPEAKER_08]: Cargill and Bungie and Archer's Daniel
Midland.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're taking on the large corporate ag
machine that exists and that have put
[SPEAKER_08]: genetically modified crops into our diet
and into commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, the truth is that hemp will not give
you that much protein per acre.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, they don't really know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you because I was out on hemp
fields this past year hemp produces a shit
[SPEAKER_08]: ton of fucking seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a couple areas go out to seed,
Sam, and it is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been growing hemp for seed for years
and years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get a ton per acre is tough,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the biggest variety right
now in the world is spinola.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a variety I've developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will give you two tons.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going to happen is that food is
going to be the main driver for hemp to
[SPEAKER_08]: overtake soybean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point, there will need to be
infrastructure to process all of this
[SPEAKER_08]: available hemp fiber, which is a
byproduct.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, Marcus, hemp oil creates
a heart healthy oil that should be more
[SPEAKER_08]: prevalent in human diets.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's going to be the
ultimate driver that's going to create all
[SPEAKER_08]: this hemp biomass that you're going to
start seeing, you know, paper products,
[SPEAKER_08]: cardboard, craft paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Craft paper is just think of like brown
paper bag or brown cardboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's called craft paper, which is
nothing more than just ground up trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Newsprint, you know, what newspaper is
printed on is nothing more than just
[SPEAKER_08]: ground up trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, they're taking basically the
waste off of the sawmill floor after
[SPEAKER_08]: they've gone through and lumbered as much
as they possibly can out of the trees,
[SPEAKER_08]: bring it across the street to the paper
mill and use the old craft process,
[SPEAKER_08]: which requires sulfur.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it always smells like rotten
eggs in and around the paper mill,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is right next to the lumber.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe in the future, what you'll see is
you'll see a hemp farm and then next to
[SPEAKER_08]: the hemp farm because they're processing
oil and crushing seeds and making that
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful oil that Marcus has showed
pictures of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ultimately, next door will be a hemp
fiber processing plant that'll press that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit into boards and cardboard and paper
and fiber and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to replace plastic?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, unfortunately, you can't make plastic,
moldable plastics like polyethylene and
[SPEAKER_08]: polypropylene, which are used and
processed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They usually come in these huge barrels
and they're just these small little beads
[SPEAKER_08]: and they melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the melt, they can be processed and
formed into the screen of your laptop or
[SPEAKER_08]: the case of your cell phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do that with cellulose based
polymers.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you heat up cellulose based polymers,
they degrade in the melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the cellulose based polymers like
cellophane, which is just xanthated
[SPEAKER_08]: cellulose just to make it soluble,
have to be solvent based and cast in
[SPEAKER_08]: films.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they don't have an engineering
modulus, so they can't be used like more
[SPEAKER_08]: thermoset polymers, which, you know,
again, flow in the melt, set up in the
[SPEAKER_08]: melt, make high molecular weight,
strong plastic components for things like
[SPEAKER_08]: marine, you know, aeronautical and
transportation.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't rid ourselves from plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I think plastic is going to
be around.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got to try to get away from single
use plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mark, is cellulose biodegradable?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if cellulose wasn't biodegradable,
we would be choking in the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cellophane could be used for a lot of
things that clear plastic is used for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, cellophane, yeah, is used to wrap
candy bars.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, cellophane was actually,
I think it wasn't invented in DuPont.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Germans invented it,
but DuPont stole it, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they, you know, again, that was a big
advance to be able to keep bread fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they used to say, oh,
that's greater than sliced bread.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that came back from the fact that
you could make sliced bread, put it in a
[SPEAKER_08]: cellophane-wrapped package, and it could
actually maintain its freshness.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a real advance many years ago,
better than sliced bread.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, so can we shift a little bit into
this THCP paper?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a great topic I was going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not every day that they invent or
discover a new connect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not every day that they invent or
discover a new connect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you know about the biosynthetic
pathway, the way that's put together
[SPEAKER_08]: through the polyketide synthase,
you'll know that you could change the
[SPEAKER_08]: substrate on which that enzyme acts on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just extends the Tinkertoys just to
more carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I mean, I think it's really cool
that they found it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they came up with a synthesis of
it too, which is Italians are noted for
[SPEAKER_08]: their synthetic work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's beautiful to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice piece of synthesis come out on how to
make the molecule so they can identify it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they showed a little bit of data
in mice, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the paper open on my desktop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you send the link so I can send it in?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Marcus, here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or send it into the YouTube chat room,
either or.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: When my computer crashed, I lost it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I'll just take a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has any human being taken THC yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard of any human being?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean in tiny, tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be found in a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, more like 90% or 100% pure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no earthly idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just read about the molecule for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a week ago today on my birthday,
I think, I found out about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just read about it, so I have no fucking
clue.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's Italians.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what the fuck they're up to,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I think from what I remember from
reading, I think on a thread on a Facebook
[SPEAKER_08]: chat, someone told me that this was
actually owned by the Italian army.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's what I've been saying all
along.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that governments and high powered
people have known about crazy cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_11]: and cannabis for years, and that's part of
why they squashed it, because it can't be
[SPEAKER_11]: GMO'd.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's these things that keep
people alive forever and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly can be GMO'd.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, it also breaks rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see what happens when you GMO it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear what happens when a human
being tries it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember everybody's told you pure THC
is the ultimate whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people spoke pure THC 20 years ago,
and it wasn't as strong as 90% resin-head
[SPEAKER_04]: hash from skunk, because skunk had the
terpenes, and that potentiated the pure
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, even stronger than pure THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is one curiosity that I think a
lot of people are interested in this
[SPEAKER_08]: particular molecule, because they did some
docking.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that the active site of CB1 is
now known.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a crystal structure of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the promise of having a crystal
structure of your receptor is think of it
[SPEAKER_08]: as the photographic negative for what you
want the molecule to look like,
[SPEAKER_08]: key to fit in the lock.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you know what the receptor is,
what the receptor looks like, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: shit, you should be able to design the
perfect lock.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's called rational drug design.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, rational drug design doesn't always
work as well as it should.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's awful good at making
predictions around potency and relative
[SPEAKER_08]: potency.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the molecular mechanic calculations
come out that this thing has 30X times the
[SPEAKER_08]: binding energy by extension.
[SPEAKER_08]: Extending the alkyl chain by two carbons,
which is a fascinating notion,
[SPEAKER_08]: because the question is, is how long does
that hydrophobic channel in the active
[SPEAKER_08]: site of the enzyme is?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe you could extend it a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe every time you extend it,
or maybe there's a sweet spot,
[SPEAKER_08]: and after you extend it too much,
it won't fit in there anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe, like a lot of alkyl chains,
they end up actually not sort of wagging
[SPEAKER_08]: out in a straight fashion, like you would
draw it on the molecular structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what they end up actually doing is
curling back on the molecule itself and
[SPEAKER_08]: creating some kind of three dimensional
topography on the molecule that just gives
[SPEAKER_08]: a better fit into the receptor site.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll finish by just saying the
molecular mechanics predict that there's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be a 30X increase in binding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now again, that's just a computer model
and docking this thing on the computer.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what the computer says.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, how potent it is, I think,
needs to be fleshed out in an actual
[SPEAKER_08]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Mark, if you take pure THC
and you smoke it, then it delivers THC to
[SPEAKER_04]: the bloodstream in the brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you eat it, it delivers 11-hydroxy to
the brain and the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after a pass through the liver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm wondering the same thing about
this GHCP.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you eat it and you smoke it,
are there different potencies,
[SPEAKER_04]: different effects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because 11-hydroxy, GHC, don't have
identical effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think part of the 11-hydroxy issue
is that when you increase the polarity of
[SPEAKER_08]: the molecule, it decreases its ability to
cross the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blood-brain barrier is a very,
very hydrophobic kind of passage and
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly changing the polarity of the
molecule, even changing from THCA to THC,
[SPEAKER_08]: even though there's a lot of arguing and
speculation on this in the literature,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of belief is that change in and of
itself is affecting its promiscuity across
[SPEAKER_08]: the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everything that's in the blood makes
it into the brain and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there has to be some
compartmentalization and understanding on
[SPEAKER_08]: what types of properties of molecules make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'd mentioned this last year,
we're working with a group in Minnesota
[SPEAKER_08]: that has a liposomal delivery to sneak
things across the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And wouldn't it be great to find out that
again, like you say Sam, by the way,
[SPEAKER_08]: the time it gets in there, it's the
11-hydroxy and oh, it's a whole lot less
[SPEAKER_08]: because it doesn't cross as readily as
THC, but it also has, I think,
[SPEAKER_08]: a higher affinity for CB1 receptor in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's I think what most interests
me is that if you can increase this alkyl
[SPEAKER_08]: chain, maybe again, the decrease in the
alkyl chain is one of the reasons why you
[SPEAKER_08]: see differential activity with THCV.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the longer that alkyl chain comes,
the more potent it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe again, that's something that
could be potentiated by terpenes or
[SPEAKER_08]: something maybe that's not, but I'd like
to think, and I have no data to support
[SPEAKER_08]: this at all, but this is just one of those
ghost cannabinoids that has been in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just discovering it now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for example, CBD has a couple like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does THC has other ones besides THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, they all would.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like they all have like a C3
analog, like the varins, they all have
the...
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark's cutting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Russians.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep freezing, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to believe that if the
C9 is there and the C7 is there,
[SPEAKER_08]: that the C11 and the C13, all these
different alkyl chains might be there
[SPEAKER_08]: because again, it may just be the
promiscuity of the polyketide synthase
[SPEAKER_08]: that's in that particular strain that
determines what of those minor metabolites
[SPEAKER_08]: are made.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I find really interesting is it's
found in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, I figure I can bring one that's
90% THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's always been
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just never knew it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and more to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, CDP, there's CDP, CBDP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and then the CBD analog,
the CBD scan analog.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to believe that that's
unique to the C5 cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the fact that they synthesized it
too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that just so great?
[SPEAKER_08]: It shows you how easy these molecules are
to make.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plant does a really great job at
synthesizing them, but you know that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're probably gonna put that,
try to express the genes that code for
[SPEAKER_08]: that enzyme in yeast and try to make it
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make that in bacteria and algae and other
things through heterologous expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: That turns out to be another real exciting
field in cannabinoids today is the ability
[SPEAKER_08]: to make them outside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you put them in tomatoes,
you put them in bananas, you put them in
[SPEAKER_04]: pineapples, that way you can have
pineapple cush.
[SPEAKER_13]: All you gotta do is go to Jamaica for the
pineapple cush, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of breeding, Sam, in all your
years, since this is a new cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you believe that a lot will be revealed
in terms of isolating this and genetic
[SPEAKER_07]: selection?
[SPEAKER_07]: And is this something you think that we
will be able to exploit in the same way
[SPEAKER_07]: we've been able to?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can breathe for it, but right now the
levels are extremely, extremely,
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you need to do is get a population
that has a significant amount,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether that's .5 or just half a 1% even,
and then by self-feeding them,
[SPEAKER_04]: by breeding it, you can quickly get it up
to more like above 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there, you take it into a
program and then select.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then you can hybridize it with
any variety you want to increase THCP.
[SPEAKER_04]: But until people take it, like I said,
everybody thought pure THC was a catch me
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's only half as strong as 50% of
THC in resin with the right terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about THCP with the right terpenes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody know any human beings that have
taken significant amounts of this stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if we have or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a discovery.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these people have found it in these
varieties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be in all the varieties of cannabis
that we've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be true, but it also might be
in .001% amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of that minor cannabinoid
profile, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a standard for people to see it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the third cello and the fifth violin.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was there in significant amounts,
it would have been discovered earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, the underdog could pull through
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know what.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always said it, that things that we
might not recognize or have discovered
[SPEAKER_13]: that are present in the smallest amounts
may have very profound effects on these
[SPEAKER_13]: entourage effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're doing is they're finding the
peaks when they analyze this either with
[SPEAKER_04]: high pressure liquid chromatography or
maybe even NMR or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass spec.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass spec, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass spec nails it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It tells you that that molecular weight is
that molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it didn't take them long to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what they did is they went back
and synthesized the decarboxylated
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at it, the peak that they
found was so fucking minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've already identified all the bigger
peaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're finding the really minute
ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the concentrations that they
reported, if I remember correctly off the
[SPEAKER_08]: top of my head, was about 60 milligrams
per gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very, very minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the CBD one was like maybe about
half that, like 30 milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, very, very minute amount.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think what this demonstrates is the
promiscuity of the polyketide synthase,
[SPEAKER_08]: which puts together that building block in
the cannabinoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be exactly the same with all
the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two, three, four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were not in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what we call in science a football
team paper because you look at how many
[SPEAKER_08]: authors, 12 authors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had 11 scientists in my lab all
with Italian last name running around
[SPEAKER_08]: doing this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Football team size paper here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, but I don't really
recognize the Italians.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know a lot of Italians.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is significant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, again, this is a very significant
finding and certainly a wonderful thing to
[SPEAKER_08]: see in the literature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the question is, is like when we've
characterized our extracts before and we
[SPEAKER_08]: can characterize say 95 or 96 percent,
is the remaining two percent molecules
[SPEAKER_08]: like this that again, now we could really
try to quantify everything that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: extracting out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be several more
discoveries like this, I think,
[SPEAKER_08]: that are going to help understand what
those minor third and fourth cellos in the
[SPEAKER_08]: orchestra are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm more than a little bit curious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing your screen,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that the plant is offering this
chemistry to us and I love that the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientists, including folks on the panel
today, are trying to understand what this
[SPEAKER_10]: plant is doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Mark's suggestion.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have been consuming this
coniminoid all along.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's why I think the whole plant thing is
so important.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meantime, happy new year, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry my camera's not working,
but yeah, this is a really great church
[SPEAKER_10]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Among other things, the conversation about
Hawaii and how to store soil on islands.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would apply to urban landscapes and
places where mining activity has happened
[SPEAKER_10]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use the material you got and
really a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been fascinated lately by reading up
on what's called Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_10]: and kind of stunned at how much of it I'm
already doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: In my practices here and the Dim Pure
family really defined beautifully a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do think that it's in the
genetics of the plant as well as in the
[SPEAKER_10]: practices of how we share with people how
to work with this plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything from in the garden to when
you're offering it to an end user for its
[SPEAKER_10]: therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole plant is the real story.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I got at the moment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just love the church.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all of you for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so beautiful to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I'm going to figure out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have to replace my computer to get
this camera issue fixed, but much love and
[SPEAKER_10]: happy new year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think 2020, we're going to be able to
see better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing, Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was hoping we'd hear from you at one
point in time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had some long, long dominated
conversations with specific people,
[SPEAKER_13]: which have been absolutely incredible and
amazing, but love to hear from some of you
[SPEAKER_13]: guys that haven't said anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't heard from Dee.
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't heard from Sabo.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been drinking deep as well,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for making this happen this
morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, a new year, a new energy
available.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the last year was very busy for me and
I sort of was unable to focus on really
[SPEAKER_13]: making videos, on really posting on
YouTube and a couple of key things.
[SPEAKER_13]: YouTube sort of, they didn't close my
channel, but they definitely made some
[SPEAKER_13]: changes to my channel on their end where I
wasn't even sure if I was even going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to still live stream.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm glad that we're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of a blessing and it's always
good to be able to send out a link and
[SPEAKER_13]: actually get some, you know, get some of
you just to say, yeah, I'll come in
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's the key, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: If I show up by myself, it's not,
it's not a show.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to show up, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to talk about cannabis hash,
everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody in chat too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat is just exploding.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes on a life of its own,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it polices itself, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: When someone gets out of line.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a bunch of peaceful cannabis nerds.
[SPEAKER_16]: Universal bong rep with everybody in the
chat, online and the video, all of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always nice to do that on a Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Reliving that bong rep that Santa Claus
came and had with us that one time there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, that's why I had to basically make
my channel like safe from children right
[SPEAKER_12]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to do YouTube really hammered on me
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't able to do anything for months.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you can upload, you couldn't even,
you can only comment on stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So people are always asking, you can't
upload videos.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people will be getting slapped
with all these new rules and I even do a
[SPEAKER_15]: video saying that, uh, Hey, if you're,
if you're under 19, please don't be on my
[SPEAKER_15]: channel.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's, it's, I think they're going to
really come after us in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's a setting, John.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a setting.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to say that you,
you can't have people under 19.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a, there's an adult setting on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not for children.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they won't, the algorithm won't
allow it to get into zones where,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, maybe people that are younger
are going to be, I don't think they need
[SPEAKER_13]: to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is claim that it's
Russian fake news from Phuket.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's that universal bong wrap that
D420K said.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope everyone's ready.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a few interesting things in the
processing world are happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, there seems to be a lot of interest in
this whole CRC business and a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people have reached out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, is it a color remediation
chromatography?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what the, um, I think
that's what the acronym stands for.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, if you all know who Murphy Murray
is, uh, she's working with Santa gardens
[SPEAKER_08]: and those folks in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the fish show, not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was good to see those guys,
but, uh, Mike from high golf.
[SPEAKER_13]: You see him too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you know, I didn't, I saw Mike at,
at the biz con, but it did not see Mike at
[SPEAKER_08]: the fish shows.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Mike for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Mike, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our mutual friend, Mike Bishop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Mike's a really good friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine is yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like the hideoff sales guy from
out West, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally from Delaware, not too far from
here, but I guess this CRC things really
[SPEAKER_08]: get a lot of attention because a lot of
people have different techniques and
[SPEAKER_08]: different methods and different packing
materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just really interesting to see
people, um, using good chromatography
[SPEAKER_08]: techniques to, you know, there's the old
saying, which is you can't make.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't make good oil from bad herb and
typically vice versa.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you like to think that if you have
really good herb, if you're, if your
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction method is really good,
but I guess this was originally brought up
[SPEAKER_08]: not just for color remediation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was really brought up for
remediating hot material or pesticide
[SPEAKER_08]: material, but it just, it's really cool to
see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you're seeing a lot of high quality
product out there and I don't think it
[SPEAKER_08]: gives growers the license to spray
whatever they want just because you can
[SPEAKER_08]: clean it up later in a chromatography
step.
[SPEAKER_08]: But chromatography is certainly a,
a, a sort of a trend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see a lot of instrument
manufacturers now making columns and
[SPEAKER_08]: hardware to do that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other trend I saw at BizCon is that,
you know, for, we were talking about this
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier about doing extraction and the
dark oil that Etienne showed us,
[SPEAKER_08]: which typically means you've extracted
pigments and other crap or somewhere along
[SPEAKER_08]: the line, things turned dark due to
oxidation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, certainly you can do,
and I've seen this where you can do a low
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature extraction with ethanol and
actually make a product that's so sure
[SPEAKER_08]: that it'll shatter up just like a butane
extract would.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't get a low selective alcohol
pull that makes a really golden colored
[SPEAKER_08]: extract that's not dark at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, it's dabbleable and it tastes
really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that Chris Witkowski and the folks
that move have been using ethanol extract
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing really well in the markets
they're serving.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a big trend that I see now is that
people are moving away from cryogenic
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction of ethanol and just doing an
extraction at room temperature and then
[SPEAKER_08]: processing the room temperature extract to
remove what you're extracting out at room
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like the fats, waxes, lipids,
any sugars or any other water solubles
[SPEAKER_08]: that are coming out, you could remove by
again, either chromatography or one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: new techniques is something called
lenticular filtration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lenticular filtration is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's similar to the filtration apparatus.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone's ever looked inside like a
swimming pool filter, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: you basically have all of these discs that
have filter material in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically the material, the stuff
flows from inside these radial discs and
[SPEAKER_08]: flows out in through the filtration
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it was really news to me that
you can basically do a room temperature
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction with ethanol and the right
processing of that ethanol such that you
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't need to winterize the extract
because winterization is just really ugly
[SPEAKER_08]: and messy and sloppy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's real nice to be able to have a
selective extract that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_08]: winterize.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just two, just two sort of trends that
I see happening in extraction,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there's still a lot of work
going on in scaling up of hemp operations
[SPEAKER_08]: at BizCon this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was kind of like, you know,
the biggest, shiniest stainless steel tank
[SPEAKER_08]: farms you could wheel into that room to
try to get, you know, people who were
[SPEAKER_08]: spending lots of money to put large hemp
processing facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tends to be something that's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you would think again, with the
increase in the amount of hemp processing
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure, what's now happened,
you know, be careful what you wish for is
[SPEAKER_08]: the price of isolate has crashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, what do you feel?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me finish this thought before it dies
of loneliness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of people who invested in growing
hemp in 2019 with the notion that they
[SPEAKER_08]: were gonna be able to convert and get
like, you know, anywhere between five to
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe $10,000 a kilo for their isolate are
really bumming because right now that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, exchange price to isolate is
just a little north of 2000 bucks a kilo.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the CBD market has crashed and what
seems to really be taking off are the
[SPEAKER_08]: other cannabinoids like CBG and CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are a couple of trends that are
happening here in the States.
[SPEAKER_08]: CBN prices are through the roof and you
see more and more CBG stuff coming online.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see a couple of growers over in
Italy, a Swiss guy in the north of Italy
[SPEAKER_08]: who's got a CBG variety that shows
somewhere about 14% to 15% CBG based on
[SPEAKER_08]: dried weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a couple of trends, just wanted to
share with everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about remediation where
they're cleaning up pesticide sprayed
[SPEAKER_04]: herb?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't approve at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't approve.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think, you know, if grown right,
you know, cannabis doesn't need
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hate to, to enable that by coming up
with ways of cleaning up tainted oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I, I don't want my, well, I was going
to say, I don't want my kids, I don't want
[SPEAKER_08]: my, my, my friends, kids dying of a vape
pen that's got, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide contamination in an oil from a
black market cart that they bought out of
[SPEAKER_08]: a bed and company show, you know,
really bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel really bad for the folks who feel
that the last resort they have is
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it just, it shows that they've
failed, but when they've invested so much
[SPEAKER_08]: of their livelihood and they're going to
financially be ruined if they don't,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, they're, they're up against the
wall and that's just a tough situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: To be in a situation created only by the
ridiculousness of the black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one thing if they're cleaning up
mold and fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that happens to the best people
who are serious growers, but when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaning up pesticides and fungicides,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just gives me the creepy crawlers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, much easier to grow it without
those things in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the, the issue that exists is
what happens when hot oil is discovered,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that, does that create again,
a paper trail back to the person who
[SPEAKER_08]: applied the pesticides such that some
regulatory authority could come and shut
[SPEAKER_08]: that individual down or, you know,
cite that individual and find them such
[SPEAKER_08]: that if it happens again, then they lose
their license.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, certainly again, this is something
that, oh, another significant thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: that's happened since our last hash church
is the EPA has now allowed just a handful
[SPEAKER_08]: of agrochemical treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not chemicals themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all biological treatments,
which should make Joshua and Kelly happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all, they're all biologicals,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're all sort of part of,
I guess, what you'd call the, the bio IPM
[SPEAKER_08]: strategy of using bugs to treat bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess the thing that doesn't sit
very well again, is that there are no real
[SPEAKER_08]: safety studies that show that when you
apply those materials to cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_08]: the cannabis is safe for consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we go back to, is it really appropriate
to apply crop protection products like
[SPEAKER_08]: fungicides, even if they're biologically
sourced and biologically derived,
[SPEAKER_08]: is it really useful for cannabis
production?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't have the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's not enough known
really about bacteria and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of foliars that they're making and
what kind of effects it's going to have on
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil and also the aquatic life,
which, you know, a lot of that doesn't go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell has a whole lot of studies on a
lot of different products and super
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, we're finding, but the one
encouraging thing, if I could just
[SPEAKER_08]: interrupt for a second, Kelly would be
that with the EPA taking the step in this
[SPEAKER_08]: direction, if I'm a company that wants to
make a product like that, now there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: regulatory pathway to developing that
study.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a, I could actually get a
return on in my investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I do the studies to show that this
biological, which is part of our natural
[SPEAKER_08]: environment could be used at this use rate
to control this particular type of
[SPEAKER_08]: pathogen that attacks cannabis and taints
cannabis with microbiological infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: This product can be used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now companies don't have to be in the dark
about doing the safety and efficacy
[SPEAKER_08]: studies to support a product like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's no longer the EPA is going to
categorically say, no, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: schedule one and no, we won't look at any
product registrations.
[SPEAKER_08]: The EPA's mandate is to make sure that the
crop protection chemicals that are used on
[SPEAKER_08]: the food supply and on chemicals of
commerce that come in contact with humans
[SPEAKER_08]: like in cosmetics, that those are safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't always get it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the environmental working group will
let you know that in spades, but I can
[SPEAKER_08]: tell you it's a step in the right
direction that they're looking to say,
[SPEAKER_08]: look, we need to regulate products for
this industry because if we don't,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's just a total wrong move altogether.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in general, I would think that
biologicals are probably safer than
petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm making a big statement by saying
that, but in general, I do find that to be
[SPEAKER_04]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just think that it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mark, what you said,
of course it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any kind of avenue that you can get more
research and more study on it is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really interesting that things
become put into the regulated market
[SPEAKER_01]: before we even have the opportunity for
environmental studies to even look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So already it's screwed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you were saying, you know,
do we need to go back to the farmer who
[SPEAKER_01]: tested hot on any kind of a pesticide or a
fungicide test?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's we need to go back to the
FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to go back to the EPA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that means tests are part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, there's a lot of these
different microbiology foliars that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can spray on your plants or that you can
put on your soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to look at it in a more
holistic view.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it doing to what I said before is
our aquatic life and what's also happening
[SPEAKER_01]: to our pollinators.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are biological sprays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that the system is in place
right now, again, the EPA is the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulatory authority that doesn't do those
testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what they do, the testing,
the responsibility for the testing and the
[SPEAKER_08]: data package, is on the registrant,
is on the person who wants to register the
[SPEAKER_08]: product under something called FIFRA,
which is the Federal Insecticide,
[SPEAKER_08]: Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: government says that if you want to make a
product that fits in that product
[SPEAKER_08]: category, you have to register it with the
EPA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what the EPA does is it's just got a
group of experts, typically academics and
[SPEAKER_08]: other folks, who look at the product and
look at the not just safety, which is what
[SPEAKER_08]: does this thing do to humans?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does this thing do to the
environment?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does it do to non-target pests?
[SPEAKER_08]: But also does it actually fucking work,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, to do those studies takes years
and millions of investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And typically like for an ag chemical
company like my former employer,
[SPEAKER_08]: they would spend anywhere between 10 to
$50 million just to get that one product
[SPEAKER_08]: over the goal line.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a cheap thing to do because
you have to do toxicity in animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as you get a bad result on
tox, you're dead in the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now all that investment up to that point,
you're dead.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just, it's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that has to be done in order to
show safety and again, because cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: was illegal, all these companies that sell
products into the space would touch this
[SPEAKER_08]: with a 10 foot pole because they have to
break the law to show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's interesting with tobacco,
right?
Because-
[SPEAKER_11]: In such a microscopic space that,
you know, we're creating cannabis in
[SPEAKER_11]: accordance with nature and we're passing
all the tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when we go, we as a community go
to make edibles, you know, they'll fail
[SPEAKER_11]: the test from the cacao used or they'll
fail tests from other food streams that
[SPEAKER_11]: they're now using.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the crossover of the scrutiny that's
happening with the cannabis spaces is
[SPEAKER_11]: entering into the food chain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've been, you know, studying about
how there's like a feminization of men and
[SPEAKER_11]: happening on earth and through
Xenoestrogens and that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the plastics that we were talking
about and through food processing and so
[SPEAKER_11]: many different things that is just
incredibly important that we have these
[SPEAKER_11]: conversations and get to a more healthy
space because the FDA allows up to like
[SPEAKER_11]: 3000 chemicals to be added to food without
any certifications.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just regular food streams.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think we need to use,
it's an issue on our community to have to
[SPEAKER_11]: go through such scrutiny to grow,
but it's also shedding light on the rest
[SPEAKER_11]: of our world so that the consciousness
that's expanding through our use of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis and then our business practices
is now allowing us to say, wow,
[SPEAKER_11]: look at the food supply.
[SPEAKER_11]: The food supply is incredibly,
you know, challenged right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have an incredible scientist and
microbiology friends that won't even enter
[SPEAKER_11]: the cannabis space at the moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're just so directed into food
and food security and seed saving and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate these conversations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate everyone bringing it to the
table.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's really our mission in
life, you know, to make a healthier world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this medicine is an incredibly
powerful one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we're bringing that
consciousness to everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking, but I was on mute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, I was like, what the fuck is
going on right now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I asked Josh and Kelly and any,
you know, specifically Josh and Kelly,
[SPEAKER_13]: because I was wondering in regards to what
you just said, did you guys actually watch
[SPEAKER_13]: that little documentary I sent you the
link for?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't because we've been out of like,
we just got electricity back last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out when you get a chance for
sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you guys were, how many days did
you have no electricity for?
[SPEAKER_13]: A five.
[SPEAKER_11]: Five.
[SPEAKER_11]: We lost electricity at eight o'clock on
New Year's Eve and didn't get it back
[SPEAKER_11]: until yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a forest to like quit and couldn't
make any of our appointments and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like... Brings the
family close.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, just Josh and I, and that's been
a long time, just like him and I here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the homestead.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we lost our power the other night
only for like the night.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in a very short period of time,
my son, my other son, my daughter,
[SPEAKER_13]: our cat, our dog, the wife, myself,
we were all just like kind of hanging out,
[SPEAKER_13]: having a nice fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was like, oh yeah, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We always figure that we lose our
electricity because we don't have our
[SPEAKER_11]: power.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take that away from us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you guys should watch that
documentary.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all about like growing organics
and like Paul Stamets is in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the guys that put it together did
a really good job.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to share the link with some
other people on the panel, everyone on the
[SPEAKER_13]: panel.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to do, I want to do a show on
it eventually because I think it's a
[SPEAKER_13]: really cool documentary.
[SPEAKER_13]: And shout out to the brother from Calgary
who turned me on to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Spacing his name right now, which is
terrible, but he just showed me like super
[SPEAKER_13]: love when I was in Calgary not too long
ago for the CHTA hemp conference that was
[SPEAKER_13]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, make sure that you share it with
the collective.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I sent it to you guys and I said,
if you want, you can share it with the
[SPEAKER_13]: collective.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know the collective rules and I
didn't want to be like, oh, maybe I'm not
[SPEAKER_13]: supposed to be like promoting this
documentary or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you guys will really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's all about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do if you're a grower and the
electricity goes out and you're growing
[SPEAKER_04]: under lights?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always had a generator because it
happens.
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that time you throw in like a T5
into like a 121.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've gone through some storms.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to wonder, you guys,
five days, how did you get through with
[SPEAKER_15]: your plants, mothers or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what are you doing there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, you have any kind of backup
batteries or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mothers going, so we're not doing any kind
of high intensity flowering, anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just keep the plants near the
window.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we, we did put a generator on
for a little bit because the freezer was,
[SPEAKER_11]: was coming out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, if we had, we kind of just,
yeah, we just, I think that near the
[SPEAKER_11]: window just works good enough for that,
for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's why we're annual growers,
because, you know, it takes a lot to grow
[SPEAKER_11]: here in the winter and we do actually lose
electricity quite a bit here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we just do a really beautiful,
big, you know, annual grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we use the whole winter to
process.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like during the winter, you know,
with the electricity off, we can still
[SPEAKER_11]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the best time to make hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we have been able to make
some really good dry sift in this cold
[SPEAKER_11]: weather and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it gives us a chance to
connect with our cannabinoid tricot.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always had a battery pack just in
case, just to plug in my heating mat.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my T5 to keep my babies warm because
of the lights going on a few times.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've just got, it's happened in the
past.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always had one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have gravity fed water and wood heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really we, all the alternative power
as well for other small areas.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as food greens and stuff,
we just sprout, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're basically in exist mode at the
moment, but we are getting ready to travel
[SPEAKER_11]: and spread the good word and be out at the
Science of Regenerative Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to head out towards Maine
and Humboldt really soon down in
[SPEAKER_11]: California.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're also going to be out in Maine
and Mark, it'd be really cool to meet up
[SPEAKER_11]: with you out in the East coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you can head up to Maine
or maybe we come to see you, but it'd be
[SPEAKER_11]: really valuable to us all in the,
in the regenerative cannabis movement,
[SPEAKER_11]: just to see, you know, what, what you had
to offer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I just started hooked up autopots for
like the first time and like just put up
[SPEAKER_15]: like 16 and what a revolution.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it's so nice because I can actually
go away.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have to be there every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to show the trailer for that little
movie I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys can kind of keep talking until I
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sharing the screen didn't seem to be
quite as simple as I thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's not going to be so easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it will be.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone can go check them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're at earth conscious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Life.org and the, the DV, the movie is
called the need to grow, save the soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: save the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Need to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very stable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sabo relievers.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope he's still on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he said, he said, he said in the
chat that he was going to get off to take
[SPEAKER_08]: his little ones for a hike.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a family man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I should have given him a better
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to tell him about, I wanted to
tell him about something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, this whole vape pen crisis
or this whole vaping crisis has been
[SPEAKER_08]: really, you know, blown out of proportion
and has actually done enough damage to
[SPEAKER_08]: actually move markets and change market
dynamics on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the things I think a few
experts have recognized, I want to point
[SPEAKER_08]: out Jeff at the workshop and Chris at true
terpenes is that we better move on this
[SPEAKER_08]: issue fast and move responsibly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're going to be starting a
cannabis vaping association and really
[SPEAKER_08]: want people like Sabo and other experts to
be part of that discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because to me, it's like, the main mission
is, you know, is to collect and
[SPEAKER_08]: disseminate science-based information and
best practices for, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: vaporization products, because we believe
that if done properly, cannabis vaping is
[SPEAKER_08]: safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, if done properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means that we really need to be
responsive on setting up a regulatory,
[SPEAKER_08]: some type of regulatory framework on
what's allowed and maybe even come up with
[SPEAKER_08]: a list of things that shouldn't be used,
like this vitamin E acetate, just for
[SPEAKER_08]: example, or if they find MCT to be bad,
you know, and if the studies are out there
[SPEAKER_08]: and the best practices are, you know what,
if you want to make a cannabis vape pen,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's other things that you can,
there's other alternatives that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: use rather than these things are
problematic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I think it's a wonderful thing
that, you know, thought leaders in our
[SPEAKER_08]: industry are trying to get ahead of this
issue and not let the, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: hysteria and the media kind of blow it way
out of proportion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I know we've all seen these,
you know, you know, honey, grab the
[SPEAKER_08]: children articles.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, it's crazy that they try to,
again, really steer with knee jerk
[SPEAKER_08]: reaction and click bait to really get
people, you know, all worked up on this
[SPEAKER_08]: issue when, you know, let's face it,
a lot of people are using cannabis vape
[SPEAKER_08]: pens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly the deaths and the illnesses is
nowhere near that of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cry me a fucking river if their concern
is about safety when they let tobacco and
[SPEAKER_08]: the nicotine vaping thing go, which is
completely a juggernaut going towards
[SPEAKER_08]: destruction anyway, because their active
ingredient is toxic and ours isn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's just a really good move by
again, people in our industry to put this
[SPEAKER_08]: together and people like me are going to
participate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope people like Sabo and other
folks who are in the vape end of our
[SPEAKER_08]: industry or have a real important role to
play to make sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: common sense is used and that we have,
you know, a fair, level of field for the
[SPEAKER_08]: evaluation of things like terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we all know, we love terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpenes are what drew humans to cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean that you should be,
you know, using them at the concentration
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're used at certain times,
you know, there could be very,
[SPEAKER_13]: very, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do you think that level is Mark?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, if you make a great
extract from a cultivar that's close to 5%
[SPEAKER_13]: terpene content that you're going to get a
fairly high terpene percentage in that
[SPEAKER_13]: extract.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, again, like I remember looking
originally at some of like the original,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going back to like 2014 when we looked
at using NMR to try to identify,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, how clean some of these mixtures
were.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that a lot has to do with not
just the amount of what you're using.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, certainly like limonene is a
solvent, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's limonene in cannabis, but the
limonene that's in your orange cleaner,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one of the reasons why orange
cleaner works so good is because they need
[SPEAKER_08]: to add emulsifiers to keep the limonene in
solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that basically makes a good cleaner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those compounds, again, at high
concentrations, could have really
[SPEAKER_08]: detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that like people who are like
buying terpenes from terpene providers
[SPEAKER_08]: like True Terpenes have to realize that,
you know, when you put, I guess,
[SPEAKER_08]: a vape pen formula together, I mean,
I guess the concept of adding a terpene is
[SPEAKER_08]: that you could flavor it and all that and
maybe thin it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if you don't have the
analytical equipment in your home or in
[SPEAKER_08]: your lab or wherever you're doing this
work, I mean, you're really not doing your
[SPEAKER_08]: customers any justice because you really
don't know at what level is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, like Sam's always talked about,
terpenes potentiate to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that's part of the honorage
effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think you can completely overwhelm a
concentrate or an extract or a vape pen
[SPEAKER_08]: fluid with way more or way too much
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, is one drop on a diamond,
is that too much?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that not enough?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't... Do you find a difference
between cannabis-based terpenes and
[SPEAKER_11]: food-based terpenes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the discussion we had many
years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So terpenes are molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no memory from which... They
sprang.
[SPEAKER_08]: They came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: So limonene derived from... Well,
actually, that's not entirely true
[SPEAKER_08]: because, like, there's two different
isomers of pining.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a right-handed and a left-handed
version.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one is more predominant in pine
species in North America.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other one is more predominant in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they don't fully understand why.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's an example where, yeah,
it depends which biological source it
[SPEAKER_08]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have something to chime in on this
one in the sense that the real difference
[SPEAKER_13]: is, is that cannabis-derived terpenes are
always profiles.
[SPEAKER_13]: And plant and fruit terpenes are always
like single molecule terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all... Everything's a profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would orange peel just make one
terpene?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's probably like... Well,
I know when Horatio was ordering pure
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes and he was getting his
D-limonene, that it was like...
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually, he figured out there was a
small, small, small, tiny percentage of
[SPEAKER_13]: citrus oils that he figured out how to
remove, which we did a video on,
[SPEAKER_13]: which totally freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because when he first showed me that oil,
I was like, it smells like oranges.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, no, no, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then months later, he was like,
well, I actually figured this out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I went and filmed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he showed that like... He took a clear
D-limonene and took and pulled the
[SPEAKER_13]: orange-ish shit out of it, you could ever
imagine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was the citrus oils from five
gallons of this shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: That he had a liter of or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it freaked me out in the sense that I
was like, well, what the fuck is in those
[SPEAKER_13]: citrus oils?
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's another sesquiterpene called
valencine that's similar to Valencia
[SPEAKER_08]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got a real, much more fruitier
orange essence than limonene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Limonene to me smells like orange cleaner,
but valencine smells like somebody just
[SPEAKER_08]: twisted an orange peel under your nose.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got that almost bitterness of orange
that comes through in the orange peel or
[SPEAKER_08]: the orange zest.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Marcus, you hit it on the head,
which is that any terpene profile like in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, and if you look at the amount of
terpenes in cannabis, if you were to take
[SPEAKER_08]: the ideal extract is you want the terpenes
and the cannabinoids and very little else.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we love live resin,
because you can almost get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, again, I got to go back and look
at some of our old data, because now that
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that that THCBP is in there or
could be in there, that can take some.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had live resin that was analyzing for
anywhere between 90 to 93 percent
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids, and the rest were almost
terpenes, almost all the way up to 100
[SPEAKER_08]: percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were almost able to make the perfect
extract from cannabis, which was just
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes and cannabinoids and very little
else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever else was in there was somewhere
like about two or three percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe these cannabinoids that these
Italians discovered, maybe that was the
[SPEAKER_08]: missing jigsaw pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just found them underneath the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool to think about, really is,
because I think that the crazy thing is
[SPEAKER_08]: that if you're isolating cannabinoids,
there's no reason why those would be
[SPEAKER_08]: partitioned out, because you're doing a
very non-polar extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are going to come along for the
ride.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to go back and look at a
bunch of data and see if those other
[SPEAKER_08]: Italian discovered cannabinoids are in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They might be in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of printed evidence
where you should be able to find that peak
[SPEAKER_04]: as an unidentified peak.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who's going to go back and do it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if these guys have already done
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I see something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hydrogenate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to get that thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to see what we can do there,
because there's a whole new bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: structures that we can make that have
never been made before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be very tempted to breed a THCP
dominant variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it could be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, here's what I think these guys have
already figured out, because it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: Italian Army.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they've already figured out that
they've got to identify the promiscuity of
[SPEAKER_08]: that enzyme to work on those higher
homologs, figure out an experimental
[SPEAKER_08]: mutant, put that in E.
[SPEAKER_08]: coli, and overexpress it through
heterologous expression, and use that way
[SPEAKER_08]: to make this thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would breed it in cannabis variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the tools of modern biology
exist, and there's scientists who are in
[SPEAKER_08]: the lab working on this very thing right
now as we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bet you a dollar to a donut.
Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And meantime, the plant is doing it as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant's been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know exactly what you said,
but at E.
[SPEAKER_13]: coli, I started to get frightened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they can use E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could use yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could use several other vehicles to
accomplish the same thing, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so far, it's not cheaper to do it that
way than to grow it in the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but it's isolated, like you said,
Sam, in so little quantity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it's a race between trying to breed
to overexpress that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but when somebody clever might breed
a whole of a variety that's got just 0.01%
[SPEAKER_04]: THCP within a couple of years,
I'll have it up to five or 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I think those guys like John Page and
those guys, and Chimera, those guys will
[SPEAKER_08]: identify the genes that clode for the
mutant for that, and they'll figure that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit out and patent that shit up,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how they had science, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is where plant biotechnology
exists today.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I see no reason with them using
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making those steps, but it was us
using classical breeding that explained
[SPEAKER_04]: the inheritance of the cannabinoids in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sam, with that said, how many
generations do you think it would take to
[SPEAKER_07]: bring, let's say, 0.1% to 10 or 14,
if that...
[SPEAKER_04]: It might take four or five generations
plus creating polyhybrids from several
[SPEAKER_04]: related families.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you basing that on THCV?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that from the THCV story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, THCV, the varieties that I started
with, I had four different families that I
[SPEAKER_04]: used, South African, Thai, Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I did was I sell them each for
three or four generations and then cross
[SPEAKER_04]: the inbred families that were starting to
lose their vigor, starting to lose
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance, their yielding way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when I crossed them and made
hybrids out of them, it restored all the
[SPEAKER_04]: F1 vigor, and it worked really,
really well for THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ended up over 10, 12, some of them even
15% THCV, and little or no THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean like 0.0.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I met up with Paul Daly a couple of
months back at his place in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's working at Doug's Varon with David
Lampack there in Oakland, California.
[SPEAKER_04]: That variety is only half as high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has more THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: He showed me their distillate was... I
wanna say it was like... It's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: work, and I'm surprised it's taken 10,
15 years for people to catch up with our
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I remember correctly, it was like 50%
THC, and like 35% THCV in a distillate
[SPEAKER_08]: that's made from that plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, but that's not a
particularly great ratio of... I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're after THC with it, it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't want THC, if you want
just the THCV, then... I think it would be
[SPEAKER_08]: really cool to breed a plant that didn't
make the C5 at all, and just made C3 and
[SPEAKER_08]: C7, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just breed the THC out and just make the P
and the V.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about CP3O?
[SPEAKER_04]: If a synthase produces the cannabinoid,
which is the case in these, then that
[SPEAKER_04]: means it can be bred to be more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of 1%, you can get it over 10,
15, maybe even 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure it's a particular synthase
though, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be the promiscuity of a
mutant synthase, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It might just be changing the substrate's
specificity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think the synthase that already
exists is creating multi-products.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's certainly a possibility,
but then you've just got to figure out a
[SPEAKER_04]: way to tweak it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a jigsaw puzzle for modern...
You're presuming one way, I'm presuming
[SPEAKER_04]: the other way.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a jigsaw puzzle for modern
biotechnology, and what underpins it is
[SPEAKER_08]: really valuable intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a dozen companies worldwide
that are trying to produce GMO
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, mostly CBD and THC,
but they're aiming at them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, none of them are able to
produce it cheaper than as people are
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CBD market... Who are some of those
companies, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: $2,000 a kilo for Dyspolyt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the same thing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because it's really cheap to
produce stuff with plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who are some of those companies,
Sam, that are doing that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing synthetic?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a list of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me an email, and I'll send you the
whole list of all the companies that are
[SPEAKER_04]: working with... Yeah, no, I'm just
fascinated.
[SPEAKER_08]: The notion that you can brew cannabinoids
versus growing them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the notion that you can brew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can brew and use fermentation and...
Some of the folks that I was closest to
[SPEAKER_04]: was the folks at Dartmouth University in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they published four or five papers on
producing CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I went there and visited with Rob,
and what we saw was they also have the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to put in a suite of cannabinoids
with a suite of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All in the single yeast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they told me that, I said,
Jesus Christ, you are going to compete
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so far, nobody is producing
cannabinoids for CBD for $2,000 a kilo in
[SPEAKER_04]: retro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I definitely met a group in this
last year that were very interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I cringe personally when I hear about
synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of synthetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is biosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are full on chemical, synthetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that's going to be cheaper
than growing it in a vat or in a plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about different compounds,
right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about completely
different... No, I'm talking about this
[SPEAKER_13]: group.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm under NDA, so I can't talk about too
much, but I can say that they definitely
[SPEAKER_13]: have...
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, Mark... Or you could talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start with a libital, which that cost
$30,000 a kilo last time I looked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, these guys aren't doing that at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something totally different.
[SPEAKER_13]: Their quote is, we built a better
mousetrap.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, for me, how I kind of... I didn't
support it, but how I kind of got around
[SPEAKER_13]: to actually listening to it, because like
I said, my skin starts to crawl.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like, listen, we're not interested
in taking over, trying to compete with
[SPEAKER_13]: plant based compounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're trying to do is build the
better mousetrap so that we can produce
[SPEAKER_13]: novel and unique cannabinoids so that
science can get an early step on studying
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ones that are not available in larger
numbers right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if they're creating new ones they'll
also patent them, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not talking about creating new
ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're talking about creating ones like
THCP.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or before that, like maybe a THCV or a
CBG.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the ones that are more novel,
one of the ones that are less available by
[SPEAKER_13]: the ton.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe even other more novel ones,
CBC or... I don't... This was what they
[SPEAKER_13]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG will be as cheap as CBD in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to remember, CBD a decade or a
decade and a half ago was $100,000.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it still is today in some circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not any circles right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's the pharmaceutical circles.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're a pharmaceutical company
purchasing CBD actually and produced in a
[SPEAKER_13]: GMP facility and your company's in
Germany, trust me, you're not paying
[SPEAKER_13]: $1,200 a kilo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_13]: They pay a huge and ridiculous amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad that CBD is $1,200 a kilo
personally.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cheap price I heard today was 2,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: For what?
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can hook you up for 1,200,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can?
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: 99% distillate?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: What percentage?
[SPEAKER_13]: 99.8 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's isolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever the most... A white crystalline
solid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, you agree with what I was saying
about that price going down and then a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of people who got into the hemp industry,
so to speak, this year, kind of like
[SPEAKER_08]: really lost their shirts because,
again, I think they were based on what
[SPEAKER_08]: isolate prices were going.
[SPEAKER_08]: As little as 12 months ago, my God,
I was seeing stuff going for like 75 to
[SPEAKER_08]: like $9,500 a kilo for several tens of
hundreds of kilos.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I don't think that this was a
one time thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is like a supply demand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of people grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this huge supply.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ability to process that supply is not
where it needs to be, but I think was
[SPEAKER_08]: really enhanced in the last, say,
two years.
[SPEAKER_08]: In those seasons, a lot of processing
capacity went in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw what Chris Barone is doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's down in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God, the size of those wipers are
like four story high and they have
[SPEAKER_08]: distillate flowing out of that thing like
a volcano.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I saw.
Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have that level of production
capacity, certainly supply demand
[SPEAKER_08]: economics, there's going to be a huge
supply.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people who are speculating and
buying from Joe and selling to Bob,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's become a very, it's just the market
just tanked, market tanked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our market is kind of jacked and weird and
controlled and we need to deregulate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: While still maintaining some of the
important regulations, because I have kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of put together the fact that if,
and we mentioned, they were mentioning it
[SPEAKER_13]: in chat today, that if some of the food
people started actually getting,
[SPEAKER_13]: if people started testing what's in their
food, the way they do their cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they would be absolutely shocked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shocked.
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe that aspect could kind of leak
over into food and we could start figuring
[SPEAKER_13]: out ways and solutions to keep poisons and
toxins from infiltrating our air and our
[SPEAKER_13]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're mistaken and most people
just don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people in America want cheaper prices
rather than safer food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: America is only 300 million people and
there's 7 billion the last time I checked
[SPEAKER_13]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're a very small, small,
small percentage of the actual population
[SPEAKER_13]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're 5%.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not really America.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We won't get into that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: We still got some folks hanging out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many people are we still got here?
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a, we got a good crew here.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I put it on full page.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got, yeah, Jack's still in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B and Colin and D420K and Etienne
has just got a beautiful, like I should
[SPEAKER_13]: have just put his thing on.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like a beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Marcus, I heard that solvent-based
extracts are now okay in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they have a whole list of what you
can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And mostly it's, you know, all,
you know, hydrocarbons are allowed and
[SPEAKER_13]: ethanol is allowed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, so people are jumping on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's already probably, I would say for
sure, multiple licensed production
[SPEAKER_13]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, for sure, many running CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: Many, many, some running water extraction
and dry sift already now rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: I seen an LP the other day posted.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually had to do a double take and I
should have, you know, kept the picture
[SPEAKER_13]: because it was a giant jar of just,
you know, golden amber rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just, to me just looked like,
you know, one of the beautiful jars of one
[SPEAKER_13]: of the many hash makers and oil makers
that I follow on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then I caught like a look and it was
like, it was a licensed producer in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, wow, holy shit,
that's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, it kind of brought a smile to
my face.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, we need to get these fucking
products into these, these very slow going
[SPEAKER_13]: into our hands.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredibly slow going system in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, look, it's very easy to kind of
spend your time trying to fight it and
[SPEAKER_13]: argue with your own bitch and wine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can do like Jack did and just be
like, I'm just going to create a different
[SPEAKER_13]: system that just operates sort of
parallel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, is that all being produced by
batch production or is it also being
[SPEAKER_04]: produced any of the continuous production?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say it's batch for now,
but I mean, that's what they're all trying
[SPEAKER_13]: to build.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the bigger ones are trying to
build to, you know, have it that sort of
[SPEAKER_13]: conveyor belt.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they're consistently growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can see everyone in Canada seems to
think that being vertically integrated and
[SPEAKER_13]: growing everything and processing
everything I were a little different.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just want to process.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to get into growing it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that doesn't mean that we don't have a
very big importance for, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: having relationships with tissue culture
companies that we can share with our
[SPEAKER_13]: potential customers where, you know,
they can go and a save 15% of their room
[SPEAKER_13]: that currently is being mothered into
bloom.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now they're generating revenue that
will not only pay for the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_13]: of plants that will come much cleaner,
totally, you know, initiated of all fungi
[SPEAKER_13]: and bacteria and viruses to us as a
process.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a huge advantage, but we don't
want to have to like, we want to
[SPEAKER_13]: facilitate like, oh yeah, here's a tissue
culture company.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's some genetics that you can have.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be at the back end if you want us to
purchase some of the material or if you
[SPEAKER_13]: want to create a partnership where we
collaborate and do something together.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just really want to offer
processing because the complexity of
[SPEAKER_13]: growing cannabis is just not something
that our company is interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you, if you're smart, you'll stick
to what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since you're offering processing just
because solvent, but because solvent
[SPEAKER_08]: extracts are now available, are you going
to start doing solvent based extraction at
[SPEAKER_08]: Embark?
[SPEAKER_13]: Embark.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what Mike is going to be doing at
Embark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike West, who's now not in the room
anymore, but yeah, that's his sort of
[SPEAKER_13]: wheelhouse right away.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, right away when I, when we got
the idea of Embark with the two other
[SPEAKER_13]: founders, Michael and Bruce, my partners,
they approached me, they said,
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah, you know, you're the, you're the
hash guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the extract guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to bring you on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I kind of had this, you know,
epiphany of like, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_13]: different stories from people like,
you know, curing their cancers and putting
[SPEAKER_13]: cancers into remissions with different
solvent extracts, you know, it couldn't be
[SPEAKER_13]: ignored to the point where I had to get
over my own ego and be like, look,
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to focus on solvent list.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my, what I love, but I have all
these colleagues and people that I know in
[SPEAKER_13]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was very easy to call Mike up and
be like, look, would you be interested in
[SPEAKER_13]: coming over?
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, and then my other partner
in Colorado, who's been doing cryo ethanol
[SPEAKER_13]: for five years and producing, you know,
lots of CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was interested in having a project in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought, look, you can, you know,
you can be this guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking to Indra for a while about
his units for Embark because he had been
[SPEAKER_13]: so known in the industry and he had
started, you know, that whole process.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was very easy for me to just be
like, look, I'll focus on my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do water extraction, dry sifting and
wet washing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But why don't we create a quiver?
[SPEAKER_13]: This was kind of my idea from almost the
very, very beginning that we do,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, ultrasonic cryo ethanol,
we do CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do hydrocarbon, we do dry sift,
we do wet wash, we do rosin, and we even
[SPEAKER_13]: do terpene extractions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have this quiver that's available.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought just from a data standpoint of,
of processing for multiple growers and
[SPEAKER_13]: multiple, you know, licensed production
growers and craft growers, that we would
[SPEAKER_13]: create an incredible variety of data that
in, you know, in connection to the tissue
[SPEAKER_13]: culture companies could really start
creating a beautiful landscape for easy
[SPEAKER_13]: navigation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, this LP wants to grow
specifically for dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, talk to Sager International.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a tissue culture company.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've compiled all of this data together
with Embark.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's like four pages of their menu
is cultivars that are specific for dry
[SPEAKER_13]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then getting into the nuances of,
well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it means that those cultivars are
going to produce a higher variety,
[SPEAKER_13]: a higher ratio of capitate stock trichomes
and sessile stock trichomes and less of
[SPEAKER_13]: the bulbous ones that sit on those
single-stipe cells and tend to not really
[SPEAKER_13]: effectively come off in, in both water
extraction and, and mechanical screen
[SPEAKER_13]: separation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So things like that I'm super excited
about.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the highest extraction rate of
resin cleaned at 99?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard of from a variety,
dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water has, you said you fattened.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I get, when I, I don't, unfortunately
don't dry sift enough from plant matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I do is I dry sift from farmer's
grade sift.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because I'm missing the initial ratio
of what, you know, I always know like,
[SPEAKER_13]: okay, like from, from most material,
I might get 20% heads out of, out of,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, farmer's grade sift.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's high.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like a good, a good one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now from really like, you know,
higher end material with us real,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, maybe in a tumbler, like the
great gardener, Matt Barron would do,
[SPEAKER_13]: if he just did a quick like minute or
something, it could get to be 50% and he
[SPEAKER_13]: was growing fairly well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that 50% heads would actually produce
a pseudo melty product.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, if you're doing a trim bin,
and trimming over it without even touching
[SPEAKER_13]: it, yeah, I've seen it come out in the
90s, but how much of it do I get is
[SPEAKER_13]: impossible for me to know because I only
know from a kilo of sift.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I get a kilo of sift and I work with it
to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still pretty far out that cannabis
can be cheap enough that they can afford
[SPEAKER_04]: to dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's much more, you get much more
cannabinoids and actin, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera, et cetera, by almost any other
method besides dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and it's like, it's the,
it's the system, the plant set up to store
[SPEAKER_13]: those compounds in.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the microencapsulated resin gland is my
favorite form of, of, of, of having hash
[SPEAKER_13]: in just like little dusted, you know,
just scoop it out with a little scoop.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them when they're cured a little
bit so that they're more like a dried
[SPEAKER_04]: raisin rather than a fat, juicy grape.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, you were, you know,
you have some, did you ever test the
[SPEAKER_13]: percentage of terpenes that were in like
the skunk or whatever?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's not a, that's not a one to
three, is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't I give you the list one time of the
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't remember what actual
percentage like the skunk has.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, it wasn't enormously high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't remember what the difference
was between skunk number one herb and
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk number one farmer's hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I tested both.
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be interesting to find out the
herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think it would be over that 3%,
like maybe even 3.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What might be close to 5% or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, I mean, I've heard rumors of 12
to 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from dried herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never heard anything higher than 10,
but maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but think about 10 already.
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 is insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we talk about like extracting
that and making a high terpene,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, where you're fresh frozen or
you're, you're freezing it before you're
[SPEAKER_13]: doing, you know, you're, you're preserving
every last terpene that is, you're bumping
[SPEAKER_13]: those terpene contents high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes wonder if you're saving too
many or if the, when you're curing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're getting rid of some of the more
volatile terpenes and maybe they cause
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say one more time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk about the need to grow just
briefly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to share it with some friends.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tanner, who was a part of the need to
grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, I think a big part of it,
like a director or producer or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: He sent me an email, I guess he's watching
or my friend from Calgary is watching.
[SPEAKER_13]: He said that he'd love to come on Hash
Church and talk about living soil and,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know, the differences of the
living soil and big ag.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he could bring the director,
potentially the green powerhouse inventor.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this guy who creates this
powerhouse generator thing on this film
[SPEAKER_13]: called the need to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can, you can check out the need to
grow at earthconsciouslife.org.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's like, I don't know,
a few bucks to watch.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some super inspirational shit in
that film.
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched it this last trip to Calgary and
I really, really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, it was just really positive.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to mention that one more time
and get, you know, I'll send you guys,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll send you guys the link here in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then actually I'll, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then here's the password right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep that personal tip to yourselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause they are, you know, raising money to
pay for their project.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd love for people to support them,
but that's going to be a Hash Church
[SPEAKER_13]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also dropped a photo for, for the
promotion of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to Matthew Tanner for doing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Devolved media on Instagram did our little
hash picture for the Hash Church episode
[SPEAKER_13]: this week.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in that post, I mentioned,
Hey, tag your favorite hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for all of you hash makers that got
tagged in that, I will be hitting you up
[SPEAKER_13]: one by one and sending you a link to a
meeting room that I'll have set up on my
[SPEAKER_13]: zoom.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to be filmed or live,
but I want you guys to come in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll probably have some of my panelists
linked up in there as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can fit like 49 at a time now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have to learn to not talk
over one another, but I want to have a
[SPEAKER_13]: conversation with all these hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: There were so many of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to kind of suss out a really
great conversation, maybe for next week,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe for two or three weeks in the
future.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have Lyft coming to town in here in
Vancouver, which is a big event.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got tours at my facility in Delta and
I'm going on a couple of tours of
[SPEAKER_13]: producers here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will be fairly busy, but I'd love to
keep consistent with Hash Church and get
[SPEAKER_13]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want those hash makers to think
that, you know, because they didn't get on
[SPEAKER_13]: this week, maybe that's what they were
thinking.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't forgotten about you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great idea to stay
connected to all these people who are
[SPEAKER_13]: actually getting their hands dirty in
regards to producing, um, full melt hashes
[SPEAKER_13]: and solventless rosins and all these other
products.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the idea of having another episode
that's just really focused on hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing that, uh, of course I love so
much and this is Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to make more hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we need more hash Johnny B and
Johnny B and I are going to be,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, filming Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully once a week.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, last week we filmed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pissing rain.
[SPEAKER_13]: We ended up, we ended up, we ended up
under a fucking like bridge dash road in
[SPEAKER_13]: West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was kind of funny because the quote
of the year was like, wow, we have
[SPEAKER_13]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B was like, we have legalization.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my quote was like, yeah,
we're standing under a bridge.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's where we're puffing with our
legalization.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, we're going to be doing more of
those Puff Wednesdays and hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to stay consistent with 3.0.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see how many we can get in the bag
for the year 2020.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess thanks to everyone for coming
in and sharing, you know, Jack,
[SPEAKER_13]: thank you dude for coming in.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys want to hook up with Jack,
I will link you up with Jack.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I can link you up with him on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can link you up with his, I'm sure he's
got a phone number or email and some other
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff and websites that I'll put in the
comment section of the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'll post the video in the
Facebook group, hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll put not your phone number and
stuff, but your email and stuff so that
[SPEAKER_13]: people can do good and help you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just thanks so much for having me in
the, in the private chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put up a link to our website so that any
of you can go have a look at what that is
[SPEAKER_09]: and explain that to the people you have
been your own network.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can just hopefully keep this as a
ongoing conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since you and John, honey bee and that
far may, maybe you could come sit in our
[SPEAKER_09]: smoke hole out back of our cannabis
program for one of your puff Wednesdays or
[SPEAKER_09]: something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, straight up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_15]: You said the city, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I was setting up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was there a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw all the stuff in there, the canning
machine, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was looking in the window, but you
weren't there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny that capping, that the capping
business is a, that's my landlord owns
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, we were, we were blacklisted here
in Victoria by all the big real estate
[SPEAKER_09]: companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we had a cannabis activist who,
uh, his, his kid, uh, ran the bond city.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he rented a, the, our
administrative office is above the bond
[SPEAKER_09]: city.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a beautiful old, uh, Victorian like
apartment.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have, uh, that north part,
which was the dank bank and trees and a
[SPEAKER_09]: bunch of other.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cleaned it up a bit and made it into a
nice outreach space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I dropped a, uh, a sea can out back.
[SPEAKER_09]: So every day we have support groups and
cannabis education groups back there,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, where people can keep dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I built a, uh, an overhang so that
there's an outdoor smoking area since
[SPEAKER_09]: we're allowed to not, uh, get away with a
lot of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to push the boundaries of,
of what we can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: To make people comfortable in the
community.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll definitely be having you back on
to update us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Johnny B and I will, we'll come out to
Victoria and do a puff Wednesday with you
[SPEAKER_13]: guys, with you guys over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be a legit puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be the best puff Wednesday
ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Dr. Mark for laying down
some super knowledge today.
[SPEAKER_13]: We super appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, he's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when we used to all have pen
names, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was Mark Esau, like my brother Esau.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I wanted to share one thing with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I joined, I took a full time position with
a company called BR brands effective
[SPEAKER_08]: January one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm now their chief.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief science officer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're the company that owns Mary's
medicinals.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have heard of us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I tried to get a conversation
going with those guys to get them up in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada and man, they just like,
could not answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, well now we can lubricate that
discussion because that's amazing,
[SPEAKER_13]: dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to figure out a way how we were
going to work in some way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, that would be a very cool way to
work with you in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it on my radar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to come up to a British Columbia
and, uh, I want to go trout fishing with
[SPEAKER_08]: David Lemieux, who's the archivist for the
grateful dead and, um, and also visit all
[SPEAKER_08]: my friends up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I have it on my list of things to do
in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a fishing guide for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does nothing but trout fishing and
stuff up on the lakes up near Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows some of the best weed in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll look forward to hosting you up here
for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, that'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a beautiful place in the world
that I haven't been and I need to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll give you the tour of embark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, skunk man Sam, thank you as always a
pleasure hearing you drop knowledge bombs
[SPEAKER_13]: as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Wade laughter.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't get to see you, but we certainly
got to hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was a real pleasure.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got a nice soft, kind voice and I,
you didn't say much today, but I did
[SPEAKER_13]: appreciate a few things that you did say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would chime in for a second.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just say, uh, one of the things that's on
my list this year is to renew my passport
[SPEAKER_10]: so I can come see you all up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd love to have you up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And bring, and bring for us back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that's, that's a hard story right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Silas is struggling a lot and,
um, uh, I've seen forest, um, maybe three
[SPEAKER_10]: times in the last four months,
uh, because as he's tells me, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: he's trying to keep his son alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going through puberty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, he's got type 1 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, trying to keep him fed and his
blood levels, glucose levels and check and
[SPEAKER_10]: all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, um, I'm totally supporting him
trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, keeping Silas alive seems like a
really important work at the moment for
[SPEAKER_10]: him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and doing what it can to keep the
families that, uh, we're involved in the
[SPEAKER_10]: Cladrius network provided, um,
the, the medical thing in California has
[SPEAKER_10]: really blown apart, uh, kind of,
tragically, uh, the collective model.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, there's some room with the donations,
uh, tax relief and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, I don't want to, uh,
I don't want to go down a long rabbit
[SPEAKER_10]: hole.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank you again for,
uh, doing the church and, uh, thank all of
[SPEAKER_10]: us folks who offered, um, their point of
view and their, their voices to what we're
[SPEAKER_10]: talking about, because I really do think
this plant is the healing of the people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And on that note, happy new year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Wade.
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to reach out to Forrest and,
uh, see how I just, at least to send them
[SPEAKER_13]: some positive words and, you know,
let them know that we're always thinking
[SPEAKER_13]: of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I send you his new email?
[SPEAKER_13]: You did.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Email today.
[SPEAKER_13]: So much, much love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for coming out as always.
[SPEAKER_13]: Enjoy the tropics, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing that with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I have some exciting news.
[SPEAKER_14]: Berkeley Patients Group has a new location
that's coming in 2020.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we now have it and now we just have to
build it out and we'll have a bigger
[SPEAKER_14]: location again.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, good things happening all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can find Etienne at, uh,

and expect not to be, uh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me as always,
