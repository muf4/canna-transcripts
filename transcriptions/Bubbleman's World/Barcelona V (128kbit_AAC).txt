[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well we just arrived here at the
DNA, the DNA buffet dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just across the street from the
Novatel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be a good group of guys,
some good friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a good group of people from the
community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it's a barbecue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure you were, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Jackie?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here for the big steaks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, dude, I love steaks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't double.
[SPEAKER_08]: UK veggie.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm not eating love, I've got nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a vegan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's in a steak restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's okay because I am too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you vegan?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no eating today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not mine, probably a little more.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little more than you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we've got Danny Danko in the
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a bubble man here at the DNA
dinner buffet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've invited a huge amount of people
from the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's tons of people from Danny Danko.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big Buddha's right behind me there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott's right down the way from Rare
Dankness.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Matt the Great, Gardner,
Don and Aaron are at the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony from River Rock and Jims.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amir and John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge crew of totally cool people here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the first one I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically just wanted to share a little
bit of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something DNA does every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: They throw together a really good... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jay's in the back there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Jay from the dab crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we've got the bong on the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only in Spain, but in Spain as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bong's on the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So John and I are here at the DNA dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's your dinner, John?
[SPEAKER_07]: Got yourself a steak and some potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm rocking some cod and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The food's been pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of this hash
documentary.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much did he eat?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Tony ate too much hash.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know the ghetto does not share a common
color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony, we just hit a dead end.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is getting great.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first I was like, you know,
this could be a good little daytime Spain
[SPEAKER_00]: trip through the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I said I was thinking about it when
you... I said, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filming people smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, you know, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the Gothic area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gothic area, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is the Gothic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gothic north.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got the magic card, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was the timing of them going
up literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it happen in Amsterdam lots
because there's two big ones right near
[SPEAKER_07]: the Krasnopolski.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is
[SPEAKER_07]: a cool little area, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got an apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this will be our balcony right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of trippy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could go grab these bikes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could rent these little scooters,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bixada de San Miguel.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he would stand out in front for
us, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motorcycle right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Street bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: KTM.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is a duke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going right up to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, we're definitely going to love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like driving next to restaurant
hotels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that restaurant or hotel?
Hotel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you go to hotel?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Private apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vale pues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the street?
Si.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is number five, but this is number
six.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our new apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got this place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what the boys are doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, boys?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unpacking in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got yourself a balcony, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take us out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this awesome view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy in Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little apartments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little tight little streets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the fucking architecture and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very happy.
It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your room looks pimpin'.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blazing check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this was definitely the library.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the library.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now this is now the bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: My deck is also connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: All connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, does it wrap around?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just enjoying the view of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Camera to camera.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having a good time here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got to the Gothic area of town.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ramblas is right nearby.
[SPEAKER_07]: The architecture is a little more exciting
than the L'Hospitalet, where we were
[SPEAKER_07]: staying near the expo.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should definitely dab up mad
sessions and then get out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for some bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do this with you,
Tommy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready to do one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely ready to do one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the place to be smoking bubbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got these ultra macro photos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get pumping more.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're so eating dinner here tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: In case there was any discrepancy in
anybody's mind of where we might want to
[SPEAKER_06]: happily be dining.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that place with the lobsters on it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this place behind us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a nice little circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice little square.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are
[SPEAKER_08]: you on the skate team, too?
Are you on the skateboard team?
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys are with the DNA Skate Team
here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some local dudes that shred it up on the
skateboards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they got some nice plans going and
they're looking to get themselves a set of
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: They checked it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked at the top grade, the
originals, which are 300 plus euros here.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked at the mid-grade, which are
about 260, and then they looked at the
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble bag lights, which are about 130,
substantially cheaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: After talking a little bit, they decided
the middle of the round was where they
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to be, so we're going to do these
ones for 50 euros off.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another happy customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope next year we see the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we see some hash from you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you guys then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you guys then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bubble man here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with David.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the gentleman who grew that fine
cannabis and the beautiful hash that we
[SPEAKER_07]: were smoking with DNA on the first day of
arriving here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: That beautiful red hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really, really lovely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the forums cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: The forums cut, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The forums cut translates very well into
the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, the best thing is that it's an
outdoor grown resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor grown resin, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could kind of tell because of the red
color.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seemed like it was grown in that
orangey, reddish soil where it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: like...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one, two vinyls, three vinyls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Early in the growing time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's more organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was full.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just liquefied into an oil when we
dabbed it on the quartz holder.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we put your hash down it was just...
It's important to mention that the hash is
[SPEAKER_04]: from 73 microns to 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are getting the fat heads that get
greasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, you've got the whole gamut of
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the profile is also more heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has more body.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a fuller profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not easy to get when you are
looking for purity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes the 120 can get not so
good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I've seen that as well with the
120.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, listen, I want to thank you,
David, for coming and coming on film with
[SPEAKER_07]: us and talking a little bit about the...
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to me a great honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have you been using the bags for?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a funny thing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the original bags that I got from
working with you, now are tearing apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten years is the first round.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now only the working bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: They replace it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have replaced them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we replace them for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubble bags are warrantied for life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anytime a bubble bag falls apart,
which isn't very often, unless you're
[SPEAKER_07]: hardcore, like David, and you're working
the shit out of it for ten years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get in touch with us and we'll
replace your bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right on, David.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace from Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give
you a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to present you with the
first prize in a bar to the basics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the prize goes to... Thank you
[SPEAKER_08]: for this prize.
[SPEAKER_08]: For years you've been eating a glass of
extractions.
Thank you.
Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
I'm very excited.
I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to say that I'm very excited.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to present the prize for
interior variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to introduce you to your
first prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, bro.
You killed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You killed it, David.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here we are with John B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason in the background and Remo the urban
grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in Spain, in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're at our hotel after a nice meal
with a bunch of good people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are doing supercharged joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got that from Ripper Seeds to give me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ripper Seeds bubble hash made with bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolute killer quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got shatter, some butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we can get this out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bunch of shatter as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them no slouch Remo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got lots of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always with the kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got a weed charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how's the supercharged joint going
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you roll up?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got two.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our supercharged joints contain a
mixture of shatter and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're bubble charge joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble charge joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better believe it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how'd you enjoy your stay in Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been loving it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely having a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're lucky we are not only here for
Spannibus, but we get to continue on for
[SPEAKER_07]: the next four or five days.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go hang out with Soma.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go see the guys at Ripper
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to tour their gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to make hash with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we go and see Javier for medical
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be making hash with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're supposed to go see Edu at HQ,
this absolutely beautiful, brand new,
[SPEAKER_07]: modern designed club that looks like it
was designed by Steve Jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're going to go see Joshua and the
oil slick crew out in Sydney.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've apparently got a beautiful
nine-bedroom villa on 600 acres of
[SPEAKER_07]: prestigious mountain forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's been like that nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You signed up for the extended tour,
I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I had to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go watch the court case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully in two weeks we can still tour
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spannibus, that's what I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, John?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, can we still grow it,
of course, or can we still grow it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sanctioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sanctioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's whole health Canada nightmare for
patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I believe that patients are going to
win this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think patients will always be able to
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amounts are going to be actually
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some kind of a change,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I mean, hey,
it's medicine and it's going to be hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: take away the rights for people like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The courts need to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to give us the right to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure seems as though Health Canada has
taken a very aggressive stance against us
[SPEAKER_07]: so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing I find totally
unreasonable is seeing that a lot of our
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are on fixed incomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 70% are, is that they want us to
take our meds the night before and destroy
[SPEAKER_03]: the perfectly good meds and then the next
day purchase meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no grace period of six months to
say, hey, you got 60, you have to stop
[SPEAKER_03]: growing at this period, but hey,
you're excess weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have this much time to use it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not even giving us that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to say, hey, throw it in
the toilet, destroy it with kidding
[SPEAKER_03]: litter, and buy shit the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's completely unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, we'd have to
document how we destroyed it, how many
[SPEAKER_05]: plants were destroyed, how many grounds
were thrown in the garbage, put it on a
[SPEAKER_05]: piece of paper and send it to Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't on April 30th,
they're going to let the local RCMP or the
[SPEAKER_05]: COPSA, per se, give them all of our
addresses and saying, hey, these guys
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't destroy their marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they are criminals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are about to turn 39,000 patients
in Canada into criminals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some major problems happening
up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the rest of the world really
needs to hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical patients have been growing their
medicine now since 2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're saying, you can't do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to sell it to you at an
inflated price.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we fought for it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just fight for it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: We always win.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in case we lose, I'm going to take all
my weed and I'm going to burn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to incinerate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any other way.
[SPEAKER_07]: March 31st is my 41st birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought of having like a come
destroy your medicine with me birthday
[SPEAKER_07]: party.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, rent out the vapor lounge all
three floors or something and just like
[SPEAKER_07]: have everyone who's an MMAR license come
with as much of their medicine as they
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: 36 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the fire department to attend and
say, whoa, the place on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just a hot box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supercharge the entire vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the largest hot box.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the largest supercharge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the technology, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can rebuild it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to continue on puffing
tough into the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to definitely thank Remo and
John for hanging out tonight and talking
[SPEAKER_07]: with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
