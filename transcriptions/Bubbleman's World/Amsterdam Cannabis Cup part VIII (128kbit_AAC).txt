[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm sitting here with Tony
Terpene, Aaron from the famed DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Fletch in the background,
Archive representing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Josh, we've got Ken,
we've got Jibs, Trichome Heavy Extracts in
[SPEAKER_03]: the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Johnny B's hiding in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flav's over there with the FTK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love that he's... Look at the pipe
he's carrying around with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking insane!
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucked up!
[SPEAKER_03]: FTK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm telling you, that is a
ridiculous piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much the bowl is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bowl alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually have to own seven other
motherships just to be able to buy that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a ball exosphere, you need a
fucking fab egg, a straight fab,
[SPEAKER_03]: a Klein, a Taurus, and then you're allowed
to buy the fab Klein Taurus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, do you know what that pipe would
sell for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 35 to 50k.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an ascension in levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on over here,
Tony?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some turp melt and some dry
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are hitting the Sheldon
Dizzle?
[SPEAKER_03]: I cleared the smoke out of there,
there's a little bit of dead smoke in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird being in Amsterdam for the
last week, and you not being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird being in Santiago,
Chile, and you not being there with your
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're there, you're part of the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, listen, I had to go to Jamaica,
then you go to Toronto, and then come to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, and if I added that flight,
it was 19 hours extra of flying on tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on top of the 42 hours I'm already
doing this trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's cutting out Africa and Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting that right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Santiago got the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony cut it too, and he added Italy to the
roster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys look like you're having the time
of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm stoked on the pure DNA family.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Man here with a bunch of awesome
people in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: This motherfucker just flew in from
Santiago, Chile.
[SPEAKER_03]: This motherfucker's my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: This motherfucker's a very good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron from DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Brian from D-Nail and Stevie,
thank you guys so much for sending out
[SPEAKER_03]: this care package, and thanks to the guys
from Dab Stars, who literally brought this
[SPEAKER_03]: out from Seattle for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it is whips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two whips.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will allow us to use the dog
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow us to use the larger quartz
bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you open one of those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Dab Stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, I'm Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to Dab from Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, can you please overnight
some stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I overnight some stuff to you and have
you bring it to Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, is that something that I'm
going to jail for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I just gave you a mad shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you're here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab Stars in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we'll be able to do the dog
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quartz dog house that basically dabs
and carves simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we'll be getting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens when you have mad
traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, please don't be full of heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Customs had no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I straight up asked him, I was like,
did you open that shit up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it make sure?
I think it's ready to go just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow and steady nice fucking light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're about to hit the ceramic dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, no, the sapphire dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better than the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turf down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turf down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it turf down?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's turf down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it's turf down.
[SPEAKER_03]: 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hit 700 no time.
All right, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I see some action.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a screen under that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight drop that on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is like a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breathes so much better than some other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're up next.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nice though, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's still at like a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to see a mothership all day over
here though.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys live right next to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool to see that the imagery doesn't
have any geographical boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet is tight as all again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all are experiencing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you naked teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: No longer in the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cooling it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pause it.
Moving
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's not leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without you guys, it couldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Amir is here hitting the turp
melts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's overflowing with turp nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Istanbul.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: No alarm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Callum from Scotland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Callum and we're about to do
the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get this deadly duo going.
[SPEAKER_03]: That there is some turp melt frosted in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet scum dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Callum doesn't know what he's getting
into here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you were kind of leaning into
the hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we probably should have done this
first, but we have to offer Callum's.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's smelling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it could work more or more against
him, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll introduce you to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to dip this in the
sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to give Sasha a
mothership rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one, Sasha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you ready for a hit?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this to everybody's
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have lipstick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's going to be like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what about Soma hitting on the
mothership?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Mark, we need Soma on the mothership
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got too many things going at once here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I go see Mark get indicted?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're slightly obsessed.
Oh,
my God.
That's so tasty.
Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.
Have a good one.
