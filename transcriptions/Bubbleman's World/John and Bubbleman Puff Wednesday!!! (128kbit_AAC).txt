[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, Bubble Man and Johnny B in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is our Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're always getting together on
Puff Wednesday and today, what a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's got my house smelling like a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: From just these four little, well not
little, but like substantially beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: tops that you cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go through each one and tell
them what, you know, just like a quick one
[SPEAKER_01]: minute explanation of what each one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one, well not really a top,
but this one here I'm going to show it
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Medi Kush, and this is what I won
my cannabis cups with in 2011,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treating Yourself Expo in my first place
in 2011, second place 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love the Medi.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really the one that we did our
full melt of dry sift videos on and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice, so really an outstanding
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in line is the new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Sour Coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll throw some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one that he's talking about,
while he's talking about it, I'll put some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these trichome shots that I've gotten
of each one in the video so you can see up
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last one that he took a shot
of, and you were saying how amazing the
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a bean craft in 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2010 I brought it to TY for the first
expo, and I was told it was pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing, so they said if you enter you
might win first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously Franco said, you would,
don't bring that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I brought my third and won first place
instead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a really strong OG cross with,
we really don't know, but closer to maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: an M1, you know, interesting strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this one they're calling headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Sour Kush that they're saying,
but it is a master Kush cross with an OG,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is truly outstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll throw some nice pictures up for you
guys to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's stinking up the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the Kushes, and then of
course we have all the dry sift Kushes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five, number four, number three,
number two, and Medi Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medi Hayes, along with two, three,
four, and five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, number one always stays home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 80 to 90% pure heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll even get a little zealous and
clean that last 10 or 20% out and get some
[SPEAKER_01]: foamers for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all in all, real, just having a good
time, shooting nugs, doing our puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesdays, having a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll have one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps of the Medi Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of your favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do really appreciate the Hayes,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was what I was working on,
is trying to pull more of the medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of the Medi Kush and put it into
more of a hazy, what everybody is more
[SPEAKER_03]: liking for daytime, because the Medi Kush
is more of a nighttime, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, did you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gentle tap on the camera,
and it was like a cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God it all landed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, you lost about 10,000 heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's only about 97.
[SPEAKER_01]: 97, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can count them, I'll shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they do look like it's a pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the mothership with a little bit of
full melt dry sift from John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be puffing with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to pass me that beeline
right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the dry sift, I don't even want to
exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm going to get back to doing a
little photography here.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's going to get back to doing some
puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's apparently good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll turn the camera on again if we feel
that there's something worthy of sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if you want to check us out

[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of cool peeps in there
right now blazing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this beautiful dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing techniques and all the fun stuff
that comes with GHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we'll be hitting the sublimator
in a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hit the fresh and I'll get
in the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to mention that Mark Emery is
still not back in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do our best to get in touch with
the minister there in Ottawa in regards to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting Mark out of U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: prison and back up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: have said that they will let Mark serve
the rest of his sentence in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys later.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottle Man and John here sitting out on
the deck on the beautiful afternoon here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were photographing some of your buds
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually quite tasty smoking too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked all of the dry sift flavors,
all five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we just saw the sun come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of ended up out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been laxing, chilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we'd have some bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finish off the actually hardworking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesdays are coming to a near end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be here for that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's time to get a few more bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 90 and 73, actually, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_01]: the real 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful day for puff and bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful day for enjoying cannabis as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feeling blessed today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you could see this melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So glorious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry you guys can't see this,
but well, actually, maybe you'll probably
[SPEAKER_03]: throw over some of the some other videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll make a video and we'll add it
to the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, every time we say we wish you could
see something, I want to be able to show
[SPEAKER_01]: it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they've seen a few of your nice
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's some definite of this dry
sift up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be people in the bubble man
world, the bubble man's world channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quiet, beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get this when you're in the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many clouds up in that sky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold and chilly tonight make for
exceptional dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like some of the last of the many
haze was the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you guys like to try to answer that
at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this whole Health Canada thing,
I'll never grow again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to grow it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't be a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get it away with one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even myself, I have a license for 20 grams
a day, which is about a gram of resin a
[SPEAKER_01]: day or sorry, two grams of resin a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 grams.
Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's I like to low ball the number,
but yeah, seven to 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, I only smoke mostly a gram up
in a day usually, but sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if I want to feed my
endocannabinoid system and I want to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: it, then I want to have that extra gram or
another extra gram on my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can do that each day that I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole license thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a whole nother topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a license and I'm thankful for
having it because I'm able to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: great medicine for myself as you're
trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-contaminant, organic, free,
clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know what I call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been calling it this for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unadulterated cannabinoid high,
[SPEAKER_01]: the profile extracted as is and simply
isolated to be enjoyed to its full
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sun, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking so white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should melt them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just in 425,000 heads have been
burned in a fire and inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for hanging out with us today
and watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this last little bit has been a bit
boring, but hopefully you were able to put
[SPEAKER_01]: it on nice full screen and just enjoy that
view for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy a couple of bowls with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back next week, Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll have this show lined up to
be on PawTV so you can go back and watch
[SPEAKER_01]: it if you missed hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, we're just on my YouTube
channel, ACBubbleMan or Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see you all very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to enjoy 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of sunshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
