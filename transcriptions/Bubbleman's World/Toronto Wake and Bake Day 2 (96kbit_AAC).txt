world and we're here with John and man How
[SPEAKER_00]: about that for a first day?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a bit of a like an adventure
starting at 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how our lives work Yeah,
it's an adventure and that's why you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are watching our adventures pretty awesome
by 5 30 a.m We were finding maintainers
[SPEAKER_00]: stuffed with joints at the airport by 6 o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hitting trippy sticks hard bong
rips fairly hard Medicating to get on that
[SPEAKER_00]: plane is important medicating on the plane
John blowing clouds right at me as the
[SPEAKER_00]: stewardess blows by super cool That was
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun and then landing and hitting
the bong right out inside of Toronto and
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting all those cool people Fuck it's
been a great trip so far John.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so far so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I give you your morning hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take that morning hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medi push.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna Watch this just you know,
it's what we want to hit first thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning and I like to just kind of
just Let it just like completely turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid amazing But you know, here we are
first thing here it's a Thursday morning
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been downstairs first one
there early bird gets the worm and had a
[SPEAKER_01]: chat with Michael and Jeff good guys and
once Mike again John the worm Just had to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw that in there so you meant Jeff and
Michael I met Jeff and Michael really good
[SPEAKER_01]: guys and you know, they're just setting up
and they're really excited and went
[SPEAKER_01]: upstairs took some pictures like hey you
uh Not supposed to be up here because I
[SPEAKER_01]: had of course my sandals on and no hard
hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know what they're a little
strict up there I had a little morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning and Astro Boy fresh frozen
dunk Just melts away to nothing got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some melt hits this This weekend I lost my
ceramic disc and that's why you Haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been seeing melt hits as much I find the
puking be bold away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of deep and dark It's very hard
to get the lens to focus inside to show
[SPEAKER_00]: the melt factor But I'm gonna get myself
either a ceramic insert or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: Sapphire one of the new sapphire inserts
that emails working on so Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll be fun The best thing about
this Dino actually is it's vaporizing it
[SPEAKER_01]: since we're in the hotel vaporizing is a
key It's very key, you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people Might think where it works Exhaling
massive clouds of smoke here, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: dissipate right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not actually smoking We're not
causing the room any smell and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that Astro Boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm about to hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect for a morning rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: The back taste on it too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part about it,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course Mark growing his own resin That
was the whole idea coming here with our
[SPEAKER_01]: own resin, of course Organically grown
only a little thing there for Green Planet
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients great product that's working
well many one Something that I work with
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely giving us the quality
that we're looking for And of course with
[SPEAKER_01]: the other people at this champ show it's
gonna be a really good weekend I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward to running into some new
booze of yeah, I'm gonna check out the new
[SPEAKER_01]: names on the Avengers list that I haven't
seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: God the aftertaste on that is amazing I'm
actually gonna finish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable We're uh, we're gonna
make a point on doing some interviews with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of the different people that come
Some of the glassblowers some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company owners seed breeders I'll try to
bring you a little bit of their
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective as well John and I have a nice
big booth that we're not really gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: Just medtainer or fresh headies,
but we're kind of gonna do a puff
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday booth that we sell medtainers
and all of our fresh headies products at
[SPEAKER_00]: But you won't see the focus you won't see
the you won't see It divided by a
[SPEAKER_00]: medtainer on one side and bubble bags on
the other so yeah, we're pretty much just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be crushing some Some rather well
actually we've got some 100 grams of bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that John brought beautiful like triple a
style bud and We're just gonna crack it up
[SPEAKER_00]: over the screens once Probably on day one
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really won't be showing it to
you guys So there's a watermelon it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come in real dark because you might go in
real close You might it might brighten up
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be some Nice astro boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna crush this over screens right
there And we're gonna come in there with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a zoom you can go right in I
think it gets better when you go closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome So there you guys go and
these are these aren't we're not messing
[SPEAKER_01]: around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are full nugs I'm gonna crush that
over screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna grab those some medtainers and
we're gonna grind Up that we for the day
[SPEAKER_00]: on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean these are like what you would keep
as your nicest buds We just run all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I John might keep some buds because
he smokes joints every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't keep any I just I have run it
all I have I have stuff that I'm growing
[SPEAKER_01]: like for four or five years monitor I like
to keep I'll keep a bud of this I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: even ever keep a bud of anything I grow in
a jar Isn't that neat that that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sort of like well, it's like the
way we got turned on to herb It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily my favorite way now But the
way kids are doing it because what I meet
[SPEAKER_00]: them all the time and they tell me well I
got turned on to herb through dabs Like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how they got turned on to her bats
their herb experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that they got dabs, which is like,
you know, we love dabs We're dabbing right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lot of these people are talking
about BHO dabs, of course The girl
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday had never hit a bowl ever of
Solventless so she was quite happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry sift in the one with the wet wash
She got fresh frozen and full melt dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift delivered to her through the email
and I'll tell you that's Aria I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: was her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took my second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked her what's this my little pony my
little pony This is like a good breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the 90 and we're gonna be
definitely a well a few of you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to try this Yeah, you know in a
perfect world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have a lot more It's not like we're
making pounds of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get grams of it, but we're always happy
to share I'm sure it's gonna go fast at T
[SPEAKER_00]: Y So I guess next up we're gonna maybe go
head down and look at the venue See what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're saying where they're gonna
put us and how we're gonna set it up I've
[SPEAKER_01]: already been on the phone this morning
with the power people to make sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that our power is put in and Did a
walk by took some pictures threw that up
[SPEAKER_01]: on Facebook, of course Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took some pictures of where our
booth should be Located to be some
[SPEAKER_01]: before-and-after shots after today and
tomorrow John H Bruffalo on Facebook if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know the Facebook account and
always check out of course bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh headies Yeah, and then I have also
fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bubble man dot fresh headies But now
I've got fresh headies dot bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, which is the bubble man Facebook
page Okay, I guess once you get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of followers You can't get
any more and so they give you ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the idea is What I see people
doing is they create a page for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can of course get as many likes as
you want and I guess liking a page is the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent of following a person If you
like a page now, you're following that
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm new to Facebook only in the last year
So I didn't really know exactly how it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked and it doesn't really work like any
other website No, I've been on there since
[SPEAKER_01]: 2007 I've just used it for basically
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty three super distinct flavors,
you know starting it out with the super
[SPEAKER_00]: couchy Kush Very deep tasting plus the
Medi Kush has something else in there I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure what it was because John was
given the seeds that produced those that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain We don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something else in that Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little different The Astro
Boy, holy shit I mean the hit of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: such a strong aftertaste and so flavorful
and then to be able to smell the fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugget in the jar like while I can taste
it in my mouth That was a pleasurable
[SPEAKER_00]: experience And then yeah, the my little
pony what I what I've called the dessert
[SPEAKER_00]: hash almost since the first rip I ever
took of it not to mean that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong it's just not heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it For morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love it all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we do So we're gonna get out
into the world out there We're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: see some people bump into some some wild
people and do some fun things I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what but I have an idea that it'll
be adventurous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go set up a booth first We're
gonna go set up a booth first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you guys in a little bit You
You You You You
