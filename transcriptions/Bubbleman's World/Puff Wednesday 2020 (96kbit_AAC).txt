[SPEAKER_05]: Someone even said like I Don't know
someone mentioned something like about oh
[SPEAKER_05]: how this happened a year ago at the start
of 2019 I can't remember what it was but
[SPEAKER_05]: it gave me an idea of how long the year
felt like it was because it felt like Five
[SPEAKER_05]: years or whatever, but in a good way in a
great way in a great way We had a good
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've we puffed all over the fucking

seven countries that I visited to puff in
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah You know what just some saw some
epic trips But missing the puff Wednesdays

every opportunity to say no to this but we
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't it's pouring fucking rain It's

[SPEAKER_05]: this everyone will be seeing this as the
first video of 2020 on my channel But
[SPEAKER_05]: really it's kind of the last video filmed

[SPEAKER_05]: willing to come all the way out from from
the the Ford I was willing to come all the
[SPEAKER_05]: way out from the bay and I'm gonna deliver
you a beautiful Long rep, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been kind of like looking at some of
the new residents stuff Like I like I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some that we're gonna show when we
go down a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course But I mean it's been quite
a year for resin, too Oh, I feel like it
[SPEAKER_02]: has like I have seen so much and when we
talked about How Rosin was going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: death of BHO and people laughed at it
called it you called it You see it how
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really so much done such a full
circle over the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely It's truly the death of
even when I saw you made that video I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, well, that's kind of a bold
statement and I'll tell you only you could
[SPEAKER_05]: have made that video had I made that video
But you made it it was perfect it got
[SPEAKER_05]: millions of fucking hits tons of people
saw it and YouTube ripped it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see too much BHO I mean,
there's you know, listen the the og guys
[SPEAKER_05]: guys like Tim from kind selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's different guys like exactly We're
talking about just the death of this
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking kind of a bad vibe people blowing
themselves Up, you know fires garages.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about people who are
using hydrocarbons responsibly to extract
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis resin with that's not what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People aren't blowing fucking butane
towards high school kids We're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about people that were just getting into
this shit and having a very bad time and
[SPEAKER_05]: the fact is is that Rosin Changed the game
and for that it truly was the death of
[SPEAKER_05]: that person that part of BHO Yeah,
like the honey extractors used to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to see
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you know, this is just
so epic and And let's like wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: it really it really was a game changer
Like I was smoking so much flower rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: and I start smoking hash rosin Game
changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's kind of like when you were
smoking melt But then you came over to my
[SPEAKER_05]: house and I showed you what melt really
was dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a 2012 You've had some you've had
some good game changers Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do no water, but we're good, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Game changers you're gonna really want to
like pull hard once I put this carb cap on
[SPEAKER_05]: and You should get that ball spinning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, Johnny B is a professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a professional There it is Johnny B
game changers, dude, it's been a while
[SPEAKER_05]: since we even just hung out and puffed a
few bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well You've been changing the game deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've just been doing my thing trying
to you know, trying to take things pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: seriously You know a little more serious
than maybe the the year prior We were
[SPEAKER_05]: having a lot of fun and shit did get
pretty serious, you know, like well,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's been some some pretty big plays
there has been 2019 Some serious might be
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing that the industry some big people
have came in we've seen some huge moves
[SPEAKER_02]: with legalization It's been like game on
it's true like everything that we fought
[SPEAKER_02]: for and talked about over the years the
puff Wednesdays and before that and and
[SPEAKER_02]: just the years and years and now you're
like Whoa, you're kind of numb because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just kind of now it's on it's it's
like donkey different But now it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: truly on like I think this 2.0 2020 mm-hmm
420 It's pretty beautiful, but we've
[SPEAKER_05]: always had a positive Outlook on things
and it's funny because you know You've had
[SPEAKER_05]: every reason to not have a positive
outlook on things and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things I love about you that you you take
your your your bumps in the road your you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, what would you call it the Just
difficulties, you know that that's sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: like things that get tossed at you and you
just you just live right through them You
[SPEAKER_05]: get turned into a positive thing cuz
everything For a reason I mean you and I
[SPEAKER_05]: could easily from it we could be
complaining about the whole legalization
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, that's that's what although
you know what it doesn't oh, it's still
[SPEAKER_05]: pouring You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard so many people complaining
and bitching about legalization It is
[SPEAKER_02]: really that haven't been worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been through half the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been like over the top I'm like I
posted shoppers drunk part was getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into the medical marijuana industry in DC
people started bashing I'm like Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came out of a coma I'm in the
hospital and they're gonna give me legal
[SPEAKER_05]: weed to help me come on And the funny
thing is is these are our peers and our
[SPEAKER_02]: friends these are people we know Really
really well really well like extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: well and I got some people gonna join me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on your side It's not on a side.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not the plant side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like there's no side to pick here No,
and I think that's really what it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: down to is is really It's it's
legalization is is about hey, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is you know what and we got four Yeah
We got four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Got your four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got your four.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got your four.com Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pick your bubble bags out your
screens It's Johnny B's new website fun
[SPEAKER_02]: with it because I want everybody to go
their own and you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not off you always have you know what
and everybody said that I mean saying this
[SPEAKER_02]: For so long grow your own for just we got
your four and you know It's it's I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying because I'm talking all the
hydroponic stores all of the all the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry people and I really had a big
look on people's like where's all the
[SPEAKER_02]: money goes it's really easy and simple I
said before Everybody was growing and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were supplying an industry Well now now we
have a corporate industry we do and the
[SPEAKER_02]: money is spent is Going into corporate and
that money goes into a corporate bank
[SPEAKER_02]: account.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not being spent in the industry
People aren't going out and buying that
[SPEAKER_02]: new pack or always or a new you know
They're not they're not visiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: stores as much as what they used to and
I'm really starting to see this and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like Well, you know if you start growing
their own for they all start going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the shops and buying the rollies buying
the bags By the screens buying the new
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe Rolling tray getting that new hemp
jacket or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they need it because they're
gonna need the supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna need the nutrients They're
gonna need whatever they need for that for
[SPEAKER_02]: true And so that's what that was kind of
really my vision I just want everybody to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow their own for you know, you ought to
pause there online You can buy them from
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just kind of want everybody
sending tons of people there dude tons of
[SPEAKER_05]: people ask me all the time Where can I
just get it all?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like it's a one stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your for calm, but but it's It's
about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about people growing their own Go to
Amazon buy the auto parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could buy anything anywhere That's the
best part about these auto parts these
[SPEAKER_02]: four auto parts systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy they're pretty much $200
everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you get a
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bubbler buckets, do you know my
first customer on over grow calm in?
[SPEAKER_05]: 1999 his name was high grade and what he
was famous for was his bubbler buckets He
[SPEAKER_05]: made those same buckets out of five gallon
buckets and he taught people how to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: and he grew the most Unbelievable cannabis
he'd pull out the roots and the root ball
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the whole size of the five gallon
bucket This is how it used to be you put a
[SPEAKER_02]: desk in the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, this is back in the late 90s
There's been so many different little
[SPEAKER_05]: heads so it would like instead of just
dripping it might like Spray, you know get
[SPEAKER_05]: into that sort of the different sprays and
how that affects my one friend of mine
[SPEAKER_02]: made these little emitters in the boxes So
they would spin nice like the people came
[SPEAKER_02]: up with some pretty cool stuff There's
nothing about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is definitely one of the best things
about the cannabis industry and it's why
[SPEAKER_05]: they I hope the corporate aspect I'm not
anti the corporate aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined it in the sense of we're part of
it instead of joining an actual Big
[SPEAKER_05]: company like a canopy or an Aurora or a
till ray.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just started my own I started embark
health with with my with my two founding
[SPEAKER_05]: partners Michael and Bruce and we just
went about it in the way that like look we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have to like sell out to a big
company we can become a company and if
[SPEAKER_05]: that company becomes Big so be it our
mission is to touch as many people as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible We want to be able to make hashes
and oils and get it out to the masses It's
[SPEAKER_02]: so important those extractions and and
getting to we talk about and I talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: it through to you That's why I have like
the site what I've talked about is
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's about your extractions when
it really comes down to when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing your own you got to be able to
extract that medicine out of there and be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to be able to store it properly be
able to have it at certain times for you
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that and there's so many
different ways from oils to hashes the
[SPEAKER_02]: sifts I mean these all these little things
that That's kind of why I really mean kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of really push to get people to grow their
own because I see how much it helps me
[SPEAKER_05]: every day Yeah, you know a little push
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get us wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone can grow their own cannabis
It's just no realistic, but when you have
[SPEAKER_05]: something like John kind of in your corner
pushing you You know helping you with
[SPEAKER_05]: those little pain points, which is what my
four plants I got you we got your four
[SPEAKER_05]: plants is we got your four is all about is
reducing those pain points so you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: Access everything in one spot Anyway,
we've turned this into a bloody
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: No screw this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're talking about here right
now Everybody smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020 is about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about it's about growing in a 2020
and I just think it's like 2020 is just
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be this a fantastic thing is where
and I talking to people I think like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: on the hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking with you It's kind of like we
had legalization 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's kind of like this,
but I think 2020 is a whole new vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cuz you're a positive
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you know what these dabs
they keep getting better people keep
[SPEAKER_02]: getting better resin I keep seeing better
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep seeing all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true Like I don't see pictures of
like I say shatters anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see pictures of of melty heads We see
pictures of all sorts of raw all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: roses and colors and most of it's all
Beautiful rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it amazing?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it and all the great macro
photographers that are photographing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god Trichomes shale and you know,
I'm spacing on a lot of their names But I
[SPEAKER_05]: need to do a special video just shouting
those guys out because they have taken it
[SPEAKER_05]: To a level that is so much surpassed what
we were doing Just even in the last five
[SPEAKER_05]: to ten years that it's been a real Honor
and a privilege to be able to you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: watch these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah just crushing It out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you and I figure out our next
point of action whether that's to walk
[SPEAKER_05]: through this parking lot Whether it's to
go eat some food with all the skiers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are on Cypress Mountain right now
Overlooking Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all clouded out and rainy I can't
believe people are here snowboarding and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's New Year's Eve, but it's pouring rain
and they're like diehards You know what
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was 18 years old I took a bus for
three hours and if it was raining I was on
[SPEAKER_02]: that mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you A lot of people here see
Washington and I'm like, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: they drove a long way and they're like
we're doing it Yeah, it's good for you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys all the power to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm such a snob when it comes to the
mountain Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I when it's raining.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a hard time It's uh, I feel that I
the snow gets so heavy and wet that it
[SPEAKER_05]: slows my board down in a way We call it
mashed potatoes My feet down when I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: walking it feels like my knees are gonna
be injured So in other words, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of leave the mountain We were
probably gonna leave them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might go to the beach.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna bring you with us So wherever
we do end up you're coming So I guess for
[SPEAKER_05]: them, it's just as simple as a simple
transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is one of these That's
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty much how that's played out for me
every single time just Rockstar parking
[SPEAKER_05]: when they always happen very well So here
we are at Cypress Mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, just like you know what we found a
way to stay dry Or would this be called
[SPEAKER_05]: Cypress?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, there were some Olympics here
for sure, let's go grab a bite to eat man,
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely know they got food in here
Wanna
[SPEAKER_05]: look at the crazy raven?

[SPEAKER_05]: little gully in here and there's a private
beach down here right right to the ocean

if I want to go out into more rain right
[SPEAKER_05]: now We could just hang up.
