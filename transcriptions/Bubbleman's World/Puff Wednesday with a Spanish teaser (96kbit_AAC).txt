[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome to Puff Wednesdays!
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B's in the house, and you have
tuned into Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going on in Bubbleman's World
today?
[SPEAKER_04]: First things first, I wanted to give you,
sir, your Apex Schwag Bag from Sir Bird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bird, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching this, so now we finally
have matching hats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, considering John and I own about 20
of the same t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait a second.
21.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the t-shirt, Bird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, I feel like I'm kind of in the dark
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta almost move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't puffed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know the quality of the Apex pen as
you've already hit it, but I think you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoy that just to have as your... You
know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is... I'm super stoked because I did
spend the day with you, DK420,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their last actually was on BC Day,
and we puffed this thing hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: All day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the next day we ran into you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We puffed hard again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a few days later, I ran into
Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it was still puffing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The battery hadn't quite died.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was super stoked to even... I had it for
five days before it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a full kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got everything in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we got the pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also got another oil dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that will be for nicotine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm only puffing hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I won't exchange your pink one
for another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the charger, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gonna last four or five days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four or five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the herb chamber, so you can vaporize
some of your herbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know I had an herb chamber.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely gonna be checking out this
pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll definitely be puffing on some herbs,
something that you don't do when I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I'll see how this works out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get back to you about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're always talking about looking for
an herb pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very kind of Mr. Bird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the next Apex pen giveaway
I won't be doing through Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of you didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly had no malicious intent when
choosing Facebook as the means to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out the contest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we're gonna do for the next
contest will be to guess the weight of a
[SPEAKER_04]: pile of hash that I will post in the
video.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got your pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a nice bronze one there with the
yellow 73 silicone chamber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got an extra silicone chamber in there
next to Charger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a little green one here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely going to have to... Well,
I'm gonna have to cross some watermelon
[SPEAKER_06]: over some screens to put this new Apex pen
at one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I wanted to laugh about was back to
the t-shirt thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because you mentioned something
about the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and he's got his Barcelona t-shirt
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in Barcelona t-shirt shopping
together a couple of months back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even six months back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in February or wherever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: March, February, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it reminded me that I still have
videos to edit from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next one will be number eight,
which will be a visit that we take to go
[SPEAKER_04]: visit Javier for medical seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before that, we found the video of
John, myself, and Jibs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was Puff Wednesday,
and we started to do a video, and then our
[SPEAKER_04]: friend reminded us that it's not even...
It's Tuesday today, not Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not today today, but back months ago when
we were in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've got that clip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nine-minuter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we let them watch it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you guys are gonna laugh at this
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Not Puff Wednesdays with Bubble
Man John and Jibs here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we thought it was Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gonna do it up and have a show,
and then our friend Giselle, who's from
[SPEAKER_04]: Barcelona, off camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Giselle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Giselle.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, John's telling her, we're gonna
film Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You do Puff every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, she kind of reminded us that
it's Tuesday, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we get the carb cap on that bad boy?
[SPEAKER_04]: You were telling them nice, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go get it while you guys puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the pleasure of finding a lot of
beautiful hash here, meeting a lot of nice
[SPEAKER_01]: people while here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, for the most part,
I guess I would call us somewhat pot
[SPEAKER_04]: snobs, hash snobs for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like a certain level of quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Giselle's laughing at us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understatement is to say the least,
but people have had some really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's not the best melt on the
panel for this particular stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the color, the texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nice smoking some different
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the only hash we're hitting right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this is the HQ mix,
or the Africanized, or the super sober
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three of them that were red.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shishka berries were white,
but these three were red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red hash is something in Canada and in the
States that we necessarily don't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: encounter very often, at least myself
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice to see the different
resins, the different genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just enjoy them all around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, when I saw the Africanized
bubble and the fact that it was red,
[SPEAKER_04]: I believed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it would have looked like the shishka
berry or any other normal hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been less ... Well,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put a name on something and make
it exotic, but it doesn't really make it
[SPEAKER_04]: exotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what makes it exotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told this was the strongest and the
fastest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shishka berry was the most expensive
on the menu as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at 35 euro a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Africanized bubble came in at 20 euros
a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super sober haze was 30, I believe,
and the HQ, I believe, was 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: The HQ mix was 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the HQ mix was 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was 20, 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was all within a reasonable
range.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice even though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, considering that the same price
for herb, if you did the math,
[SPEAKER_04]: even for their cheapest herb, was $7 a
gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their most expensive was 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do the math of 10 grams per gram of
bubble herb to bubble, you're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: $100 plus, $70 to $100 plus for a gram of
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually got it quite a bit cheaper
than if we would have bought the weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: made it into the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both understood that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: David and Eduardo both were slow
education, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Spanish people still have a very hard
time paying 20 or 30 euros for a gram of
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand the hash culture
here is from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morocco is literally a stone's throw away
from this country across the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of this hash just comes over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Average price for Spanish Moroccan hash is
about $3 a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're mixing it in with their tobacco
and they're smoking spliffs with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now imagine these young guys opening up a
beautiful place and showing people,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, no, no, if you're going to smoke it,
smoke it pure, and in it's 30 euros a
[SPEAKER_04]: gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 times the price that they're used to
paying for hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention they can't really smoke it
the same way and it doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_04]: taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys have an uphill battle in my
opinion, but the fact of the matter is...
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat with the breeder who bred all these
strains while I was photographing him,
[SPEAKER_04]: his name was Danny, and spoke with him a
little bit about how he went about,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's been doing it for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: How he went about breeding his strains and
selecting and whatnot, and just was all
[SPEAKER_04]: around impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The herb that he had that he showed me in
the jars, it was a breast run,
[SPEAKER_04]: David, the Russian guy, he basically told
me it wasn't good enough quality for a
[SPEAKER_04]: shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at this bud growing,
I could have easily run this through the
[SPEAKER_04]: shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have just easily put it on the
menu and run the whole kilo right out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, and I was impressed that
he said this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you know, it was because of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we watch you and we follow you
and you're the perfection and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: has to be the best and that's why we want
to watch this bud and not sell it on our
[SPEAKER_04]: menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that's like twice as much
money lost for him to have that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm convinced that most people
choose profit over integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thus we have what is called,
you know, and I say this in a way,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't call it the entire scene,
but the BHO scene in brackets,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is not Virg Phillips, which is not
like the high end guy K from Trichome
[SPEAKER_04]: Technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are actually doing it on a
level that's unique and different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the 98%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys really impressed me in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only want ice hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have a puff with us on top
Wednesday, Tony?
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be great if Wells Fargo could
communicate to Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's having issues, but we're going to
get his issues sorted out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually on our way to medical seats
here right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go see Javier, who won
first prize for the best water hash at
[SPEAKER_04]: Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe he won also maybe a second
for his oil extraction, but I don't quote
[SPEAKER_04]: me on what extract it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he made it with ISO or
butane or what his salt was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he won a solvent one as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Javier won a solvent and a solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he won two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just coincidentally, these are the
guys that we're sussing out and feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: good about meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they won literally five or six of
the, what, 15 cups that we're giving away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this me or is this you?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'd be lining yourself up a hit
and just take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puffing in Barcelona with Jibs and John.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Africanized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have Super Silver Haze,
HQ Mix, which I suggested to them that
[SPEAKER_04]: they call Lucky Day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a cannabinoid profile that
they'll never see again, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's when they take certain hashes and
they mix them all together and they call
[SPEAKER_04]: it their HQ Mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, man, you should call that stuff
Lucky Day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, whoever buys that,
it's their lucky day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're never going to find that
cannabinoid profile ever again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you mix them like some OG
and some sour and some emerald and some
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe and you just had a little bit of
this other one that you threw in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those quite frequently end up becoming my
favorite batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I end up having to do it a lot myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, because that gets us to a point
now where we're not just extracting
[SPEAKER_04]: resins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're like alchemists or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're mixing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making our own blends of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly in the way of just looking
for a different relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having all your different kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They let us know every time what time it
is up here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to finish off with a
few more rips and then we've got to get
[SPEAKER_04]: jumping a cab and go see Javier from
Medical Seeds get this day started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to wash some resin
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright guys, well, keep watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm kind of all for John's idea in
which we crush this herb that he put on
[SPEAKER_04]: the screens in front of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that's about 50 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 70 grams together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the screens set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the 250 and the 180 which is the
90 and the 60 LPI.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we have the 60 on top as it is the
smallest number.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be the biggest hole size if
measured in microns.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the LPI to micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's confusing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good that we're actually
measuring this because even I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: confused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone gets confused.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've taken pictures of them backwards
and I was like, yeah, so thank you for
[SPEAKER_06]: explaining this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we get into the micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that microns are easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 250 would be a big hole going down
to a 180, to a 160, a 120, a 90,
[SPEAKER_04]: a 73, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were doing bubble bags or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes from bigger to smaller but lines
per inch works in the opposite way of the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual size of the hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many lines per inch measures how big
the hole is and it generally works in the
[SPEAKER_04]: opposite way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, 250 micron would actually be
60 lines per inch whereas 180 micron would
[SPEAKER_04]: be 90 lines per inch and it continues down
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the 70 micron here which is 200
lines per inch as you can see right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna take some of this herb and
yeah just get some quick hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go for some quick hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some quick hits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is the watermelon that basically
that I just finished trimming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just the easy get a couple
quick hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that smell good?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice little popcorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two screen method here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's check.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this method.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way lighter you are, the way higher
the quality will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nice and light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold that up for one second.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that is one grade right there that's
down on this screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember if you lift them both
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gently, gently.
[SPEAKER_04]: What will be left on top of this screen
should be of the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got my brush there?
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that is some glistening stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean ridiculously so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the macro camera on that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so a little bit of head is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Sir John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aiming up it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some full-mount trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the head is.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the taste on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't know one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna be growing only low temps,
low humidity, tasty as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is, that is by far some of the most
resonance plant that I've actually grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Had some bug problems so I went down to 65
degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 during the day and with that we got
some amazing resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, the turps are definitely
amazing too and next step a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: colder see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make me a hit.
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this stuff is not dry enough for
this real type of dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you dry this out even more,
you'll find that it really releases those
[SPEAKER_00]: heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well maybe I'll have to do that with bone
drying and then I'll crush it over the
[SPEAKER_06]: screen and see exactly what we get out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably good right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll guarantee this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gonna move right over, grab that little
bud up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll put it right back where it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are kind of a little bit blocked by
the little bit of contaminant floating
[SPEAKER_00]: around there but I'll be able to get that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, nice little hit for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we can even do the, after this we do
the flick.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flick?
[SPEAKER_07]: The flick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta remember the flick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the brush.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to work very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely gonna get myself one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the simple brush, that's all you
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this is just a little mini hit
but a hit nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna get some bigger heads out of
this, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super tasty and lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's give it a flick.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can definitely see the amount of
contaminants on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some very big heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, gotta get a brush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that actually looks really nice and
clean too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think these ones look even nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely a... Well,
let's get out the macro camera and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rostral Boy, TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 420 approaching quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna do a little 420 dab-a-doodle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna pack your new Apex pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got it all ready up and working.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting all nice and red in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some of the MKU fresh frozen that I
just did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you can hear it's kinda sitting
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, it's just smoking away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm just dumping hash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little baby room on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gonna do a dab as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little dab as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: What have we got here?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a two-minute warning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couple minutes, couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 418.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we got a couple of nice hits to
the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we realized that the bud was just
not really dry enough when you're... This
[SPEAKER_04]: is a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard enough to commit to put your
buds on a screen and grind them all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the true commitment comes in will you
actually dry that bud right to bone dry to
[SPEAKER_04]: the point where it's not really going to
be that good for puffing like in joints
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really being committed to you using
it in hash making.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, it looks like I'm taking it
back home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a nice and bone and crisp dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did that last time I let it hang for
about a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was hot out and then I guess the
bag started sweating a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back to the old screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the same set sitting at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm definitely gonna go home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw that popcorn on there and
we're gonna bone dry that out and
[SPEAKER_06]: basically come back with it all nicely
crushed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll film it and then I can come
back here and I'll clean it next puff
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still have to do the fresh folds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the same strain in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's 280 grams of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think because of the weather right
now and it'd be cool out and it's raining.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm gonna get to that batch maybe
tomorrow myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you got some backup yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is my rag next to you there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my rag on the table here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to clean the dabber without it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dabber gets nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it hit like a champ too?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing does hit like a champ.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a serious machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bomber brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In your pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very nice little thing to put on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get dabbed the fuck out with a
piece like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been dabbing quite hard right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember in Spain when we were dabbing you
out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's think about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dtfo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dtfo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dtfo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently John has been dabbed the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: When's the last time you traveled to
Europe with your friends John?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here at G13 Barcelona Club and John
Berfalo has been Dtfo'd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes ladies and gentlemen he has been
dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that Jibs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the second or third
location of where he has straight just
[SPEAKER_01]: passed out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in California everyone would be
laughing hard but here in Spain it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: called Siesta.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you later.
