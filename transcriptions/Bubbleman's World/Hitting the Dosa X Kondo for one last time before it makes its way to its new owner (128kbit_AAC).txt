[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over at Flav's place and about to hit
this beautiful Dosa condo collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The condo is a marble on the bottom,
you can see right there, and you can kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of see it in through the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really a window to see it,
but it is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line work is insane, like I'm
absolutely blown away, especially by this
[SPEAKER_01]: top neck of the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really incredible work, Dosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thumbs up on this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the D-nail in with the silicone
carbide nail, and we're gonna hit a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of bubble hash out of this bad boy,
so let's get her started, shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two thumbs up.
That's what I'm talking about right there.
