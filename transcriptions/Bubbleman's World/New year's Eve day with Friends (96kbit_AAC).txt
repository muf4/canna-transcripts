[SPEAKER_03]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: New Year's Eve day with Matt the Great
Gardener and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got another crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Flav is dropping off his son and
Aaron and his wife are dropping off their
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess we're gonna head up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we're gonna be heading up
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time you guys are seeing
Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to do a little intro video with
him last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed up last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess you were at your grandma's
100th.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100th birthday back in Ontario,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the cutest and the most endearing
grandma anyone could ever have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the stories that she tells of 1914.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that she remembers 1914, but...
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when she was born?
[SPEAKER_00]: When she was a young person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's seen it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's seen everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's seen it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we're gonna see some cool things
today up on the mountain and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: share that with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really bring my great video
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my phone here and I got my 5D so
we'll do a little puffing up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go maybe hit some jumps with some
friends and just looking to have an
[SPEAKER_03]: all-around fun day here up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a great day today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adventure!
[SPEAKER_00]: New Year's Eve in Whistler!
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I used the RFD
reader.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I felt it in my leg go off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was touching me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electromagnetic frequency pulse through my
veins.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, what up, what up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gondola time!
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be in our movie?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the skis and boards inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I tripping out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did she really say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did she really just say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump in here, guys!
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistler Peak in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top of the roundhouse with Flav,
Matt the Great Gardener, and Aaron from
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Cali boy up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: No stranger to the mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it beautiful?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inversion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today it'll be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, New Year's Day in Whistler with
Matt the Great Gardener and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron from DNA somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Flav 421 in the house somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just shredding down a little hill
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna grip it up there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice little speed run down Whistler
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like just insanely epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good fun, good fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to continue the
shred.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get the GoPro out and show you some
of that footage too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the line of the Emu chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, is this ever different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, we're a three, but we're going to
get a four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might make puffing a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the new R.I.F.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine just turned green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually keep them pretty,
pretty close.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to keep those on the child.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'll happen is it'll be monitored by
the computer and it'll start beeping when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not moving from the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll radio to him and say one
of your kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it made me happy to know that my
kids will worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny how they always get us with
these sort of scary, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've always said that, oh, they're
going to get us all microchipped so they
[SPEAKER_03]: know where we all are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, but wow, like as a
parent, it's a terrible thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, just just lose your kid
at the grocery store for two minutes and
[SPEAKER_03]: see how that feels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we just got to the top of
the roundhouse here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to head up these stairs,
go check out Seppos and go check out a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you come join us?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of pointed it out to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll tell him to go there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a satin jacket on your phone?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Aaron's just informed me that his wife
has the keys, so he's good to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can do some falling down this mountain
here and the keys won't get lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't get home.
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA Army bubble ambassadors representing
Whistler Blackholm.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's the Duck Party Dance Zone,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your crack on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Party bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hanging out with Aaron and Patty and
Zdenka.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going up to Whistler Peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We came out at 6K Mark, which was hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we would have came out closer to
five, it's one big giant cliff band.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 500 plus feet, that cliff band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multihundred foot death cliff band.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I also ended up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I ended up first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to hike out along the cliff
band.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you alone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, at least I was with fucktard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one beer and a half, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reception yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you taking me?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this was 20 fucking years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 24 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't have cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you did, you were like literally
selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those big giant motherfuckers that
you didn't even... Yeah, and it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: 1500 bucks to buy and 100 bucks a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistler bale, bold as shale smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most difficult conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those signs should say most fun
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mandatory drop to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, drop off the cornice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tosh took me in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: When he was eight years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and he's like, Dad, you gotta check
this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My ski teacher showed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took him in there, and he took me in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, are you fucking kidding
me, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not... So, uh, safety?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mellow... I'm following.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like, following.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys got me to go down that thing
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got you on the top of the mountain,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most difficult conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expert breeders, bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA army.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, pate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd say let's do the scoop,
but I don't really... You just take us
[SPEAKER_04]: where you want, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just a bit of a traverse to
come out, that's all.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you like, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a look at it, anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go have a look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking, scoop or cake?
Scoop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, has it been real windy here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it looks like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks kind of windblown, eh?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Devin was saying, it's really
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't say it about this area per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm sure over there it looks better,
but here, like, we're only gonna go to
[SPEAKER_04]: here, then go around, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
Almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went a little too far left.
But I'm good.
No windy up here.
Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope my pate and zdenka will be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pate, pate and zdenka.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, guys, that was our first day on
Whistler Mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that, Aaron?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you guys really got it going on up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it is good fun up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some world-class shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you come to Whistler, one of the
things you'll notice really fast is that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a world-class resort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think you can ski, you probably
can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably can't, so we figured we'd
have a little trippy stick session.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go hook up with Matt,
the great gardener, and Flav421,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we figured we hadn't been puffing too
much for you guys, so we figured we'd get
[SPEAKER_03]: the trippy stick out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some of Matt's CBD rennet,
which has been real tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that for my legs right now,
boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you hit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice and fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice dry sift that we're puffing
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the mountains in the
background here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like we say, epic, epic world-class
mountain range.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice to have this guy up here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've hung out with this guy in a bunch of
different countries, but never Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on the water with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girl's been wake skating behind your
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she killed it on the wake skate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what happens when you marry a
Canadian girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada will represent in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple more rips on that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll head on down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna head down in the gondola.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some little kids with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna take them down in the gondola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gondola.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess what's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna have a big feast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jacuzzi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the hot tub at the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble man's world, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that guy doesn't even know it,
but now he's on a major cannabis website.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's how friendly Whistler
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is smiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he didn't want to hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want to hit because he's working
for the snowboard school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't offer anyone that's working on
the mountain a hit because that would put
[SPEAKER_03]: their jobs at risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only for a couple more years when Whistler
goes pro ganja and we're actually using
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational cannabis here in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just up at the roundhouse here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sepo's up at the top of Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada versus US.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada just scored a couple more goals and
got everyone really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is sort of what we do on the mountain
when the riding is done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get together with friends, have a few
puffs with the trippy stick, and enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistler Mountain.
All right.
All right, let's go.
