[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I put up a video I
know I've been pumping out the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: churches every Sunday But I have been very
busy lately and trying to get some new
[SPEAKER_00]: products on the up to on the market as
well as working out with some different
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting gigs and of course constantly
trying to promote the Jamaican project
[SPEAKER_00]: that we started last year along with our
partners and United cannabis So all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are sort of coming to a head
and there's you know, they're beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: here And they're beginning there and I
finally wanted to get this video out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this new product in about a week ago
These are of course the rosin bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three sizes here We've got the 4
inch by 5 inch which you can see right
[SPEAKER_00]: here and it's just a nice little screen
pouch that you can put your product in
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my medium size Which I have it
about 3 inches by 4 inches This micron
[SPEAKER_00]: screen is 32 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got I've moved away from the 25
and I've gotten the 32 micron which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to offer at a better price And of
course, I don't think people are really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in paying, you know,
seven eight nine dollars a piece for these
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently have these up on the site you
ten in a pack with the pouch and the label
[SPEAKER_00]: and It's 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're four bucks a piece and of
course, they're very very very reusable
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the smallest ones which I think
you're going to be very very popular this
[SPEAKER_00]: is Really the hair straightener size right
here these two although I'm sure you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get that into a one of the wider hair
straighteners just I find that these two
[SPEAKER_00]: are really going to be for the press this
one for the five by five that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: right here and This one I would suggest to
use on the larger press Although I might
[SPEAKER_00]: try to fold it up in a way where we can
get off one press today This is also a 90
[SPEAKER_00]: micron bag the larger style a lot of the
people that will be Using this larger
[SPEAKER_00]: style are going to be packing it full of
hash Those that are going to be using it
[SPEAKER_00]: for bud good friend Rufio from the
advanced rosin tech group was mentioning
[SPEAKER_00]: that he prefers a 90 over a 120 Maybe it
was a 120 over a 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really remember now, but we'll
make sure we confirm with him later We've
[SPEAKER_00]: got custom sizes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if anyone wants more than 200
singles I can do any dimensions that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want in most microns that you would
request Depending on what you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just hit me up at bubble man at bubble bag
calm and make the subject Rosin bags all
[SPEAKER_00]: in capital and I'll be able to give you a
quote there So I guess today what I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do was squeeze off a couple of
batches I've got my new paper here that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be using instead of parchment
I don't know the name of this yet as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still basically researching it along with
Tony who sent it to me It's his release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just using the material you can ask
as much as you want inside the content But
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be able to tell you what it is
because I still don't know what it is I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was a Teflon sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a Teflon sheet hit up Tony
Verzura T Verzura on Instagram if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to know he might tell you but
I think we're first going to be making it
[SPEAKER_00]: as Sure as a safe product as possible
before we let people know the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be doing a squeeze
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we will do One of these with some
nice hash in it as well as packing it
[SPEAKER_00]: fully The herb I think the majority of
people let's be honest are using these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller batches to squeeze herb a lot of
people are squeezing bud and I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't necessarily Need a screen if
you're going to be squeezing your rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your bud But it's definitely comes
in handy if you want to have the clean
[SPEAKER_00]: clean clean and you don't want to spend a
very long time Picking out particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: from your rosin that got in there from the
bud So of course a small little screen
[SPEAKER_00]: like that is easy now It's got a very
small hole to fit in So what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest doing for people is you get a
business card like this one here my bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: bag business card fold it in half so to
stick it in like this and Then you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to easily fill that little bag say if
you want to pack it full of some Ground up
[SPEAKER_00]: herb that you had it would it would pretty
much pack pretty nice like this There we
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if I'll pack all Of this
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I could if I wanted to I'm not a
big cab bud Squeezer, I haven't squished a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have mostly been doing hash We'll
slide that out right like that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see you have a nice little pouch
full of bud So basically, why don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on our press?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so a good thing to make sure
when you turn your Dino press on is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you Have it lowered to the proper size
Good for me One little half on the screw
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to make sure it's good
when you're on camera, especially so a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people were using my pressing screens
these are the original pressing screens
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bubble bag kit and That's what
people have been using to press out their
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin right now But I found that it was
more efficient for us to produce a product
[SPEAKER_00]: for them make it a Less expensive and
easier to use with the sewing it is a pain
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ass when you only have them folded
the folds can potentially open quite
[SPEAKER_00]: easily so Turned on the Dino press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already at 30 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heats up quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, of course is going to go to
about a hundred and twenty hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty five and that will be a good 240 to
250 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't really go much hotter than
that We should also pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some OG We've got some paint so
we've got some bubble that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pressing as well I'm going to use some
more of this Lindsay OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real nice color on her in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the real light tan color a
solid four star bubble, you know by no
[SPEAKER_00]: means a five or six but a solid four real
nice enjoyable flavor and taste and While
[SPEAKER_00]: it presses out unlike anything I've really
seen let me see if I can really just show
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little a little of the cured out
Lindsay OG Rosin that I made oh this must
[SPEAKER_00]: be a couple of At least a couple of weeks
old now, so that's That's the quality that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dealing with right there You can see
that's pretty much the goods right there
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeezed out of one of these little
pressing screens and so I want to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: both today basically I want to show you
the process Being done with hash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to show you the process being done
with some bud now this bud here I would
[SPEAKER_00]: wager that it is not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very light and powdery We can throw
the one of these screens on the scale real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and that's a point four So we'll
tear that and then we'll throw that on and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is 2.5 grams 2.5 grams of cannabis
And it's nice to be able to If you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already got your thing heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad idea to just Just close the
top You can see that right there how it
[SPEAKER_00]: just folds over real nice and I still have
a little bit of room for the bud to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually expand so we're not going to be
popping anything out and We'll just get it
[SPEAKER_00]: on either side of our sheet here We'll do
a little squeeze and we'll see what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get Here off of off of a little bud the
bud by the way for those of you that were
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure going to ask is My 20 year old
bud 20 year old seed from Jamaica see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that without the reflection in
the camera and This is from Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Burfell was such a kind dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave this to me for one of my birthdays
This was the first bud he grew he was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first people I gave the clone to of
the 20 year old lamb spread Jamaican and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bag of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know 100 grams or so,
but it's mostly been powdered and broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down So I thought why not we'll use that
and we'll show them what we can get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that So let me just make sure yeah,
this is closed Give it that gentle little
[SPEAKER_00]: first press going in And here we go It's
got a nine second timer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this little D now press with the
timer I can just just started to hear it
[SPEAKER_00]: now after about six to seven seconds I
Like to use my ear because I can really
[SPEAKER_00]: hear what's going on with the press I can
hear it squeezing out resin and Let's give
[SPEAKER_00]: that an opening real quick All right,
so Yeah, nice little squish of buds by
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone's standards decent little squish,
I'm guessing there'll be at least a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram there out of Our two and a half grams
that we put in so it looks like we should
[SPEAKER_00]: have about a 20% But of course I'll gather
that all up and show you that on the scale
[SPEAKER_00]: here in a little bit What I want to do is
I want to get to pressing some hash all
[SPEAKER_00]: right guys So just did a quick weigh in to
show you what I got the tear on this is
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.1 Sorry, I guess I can't really turn it
at an angle like that and so the total was
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.4 I'm not sure if you guys can see that
or not kind of hard without showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual Kind of hard without taking the
actual camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not point three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't weigh point three All right
here we go it's hair So that's at a point
[SPEAKER_00]: four point three point four probably
squeeze out another tiny little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: there if we really wanted to As the screen
bag still has a little bit of stickiness
[SPEAKER_00]: to it as you can see there still a little
bit of stickiness left there if I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean out but a solid 18% return on bud
like I said I could easily take that give
[SPEAKER_00]: it one more good squeeze I'm really used
to squeezing hash so Enough of this
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezing bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to squeezing some of the first
Fun stuff shall we bubble today now some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these are quite large this one for
instance would fit Easily 15 to 20 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of hash so that's a substantial squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with our little guy,
and I'm going to use if I can find it The
[SPEAKER_00]: business card there it is nice little
business card right there and Real simple
[SPEAKER_00]: method for filling this guy up is to get
your card into there like that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just Drop your hash in there,
and it fills it up real nice and simple
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my scale right here as well So we
can put one of these on it and tear it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the point four I believe that they weigh
All right Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's a point four Let's get some
bubble hash into this show and squeeze out
[SPEAKER_00]: some rosin It's a real nice return on This
particular stuff I should get at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% possibly 60 if I really kind of Go for
it All right, let's see what this little
[SPEAKER_00]: guy weighs All right, so that's almost six
grams I Guess we could put a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more in there just to make sure that it
Reaches that six gram marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like working with an even number if
I can And you can see that it's filled up
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm of course gonna Press it down a little
bit all right, so that is six point one
[SPEAKER_00]: grams now you can hear the D nail Working
away in the background clickety-click
[SPEAKER_00]: clickety-click, so yeah, I just kind of
Make this is self-pressed it into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of puck well that feels nice All
right one of the things people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is Flipping the bags inside
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you can do simply
enough with the edge on the outside here
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a fair bit of Wicking this is what
people have been saying anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't noticed it myself, and I've
pressed both ways But hey, it's a trick
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you find your screen is too full
of resin You can flip it inside out now if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like me and that just sort of
becomes a pain in the ass I can also show
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little trick that if you do have
resin soaked into your screen at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done is I've taken this and I've
just wrapped it up in a ball with nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: in it and pressed it for a few seconds
inside one of my sheets here the
[SPEAKER_00]: Experimental sheet that Tony sent me and I
find that all of it comes out to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can feel the screen is dry It
has no stickiness to it so those are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of tips that you can do you can do
the flip inside out if you if you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: it's necessary and even if you're Still
finding that there's some resin on your
[SPEAKER_00]: final screen after you flipped it the
right side or sorry inside out You can do
[SPEAKER_00]: my little trick, which I'll probably show
you here at the end But if not just
[SPEAKER_00]: remember simple rolling it up into a
little piece Flattening it down between
[SPEAKER_00]: your parchment or whatever you're using
oil slick pad experimental sheet Whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it is squeeze it down on there,
and you'll see that that resin will escape
[SPEAKER_00]: quite quickly So we've got our little guy
here a little six grammer I'm just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: fold that guy over real nice slap it into
our experimental sheet I Like to give this
[SPEAKER_00]: a little a little pre-press as we call it
that just gets it sitting nicely in place
[SPEAKER_00]: and Let's see what we can do with this
little guy here make sure the plates are
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up and Away we go
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's coming Yeah, I can see her
leaking out here not sure if you guys can
[SPEAKER_00]: catch that but that is rosin just dripping
dripping out Okay
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so as You can see we did a nice
little squeeze there with that little that
[SPEAKER_00]: little screen Nice return on that
beautiful golden color and a real nice
[SPEAKER_00]: All-around smoke now we can kind of pull
this guy out from the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought those were actual I thought that
was an actual fiber and it was just oil
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off of the thing So you can see
this still has a little bit of stick and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of moisture to it And in fact
you can see on the edges what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about with those edges picking up
that rosin Well, I'm not done yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna show you how you can refold
this up into a smaller little piece we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get that into a Quarter the size that it
was we're just gonna give that one more
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze while we can a self press is
always helpful to keep it from popping
[SPEAKER_00]: back up out of place and a Secondary press
so much easier than a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even funny Nice and convenient to
have these sewn up and also to have ten of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in each pouches is a real Bonus,
so let's see what we got coming out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually quite efficient in my first
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit I've managed to get quite
good at this So let me just get this
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy out of here now this guy is
much drier now although I can see a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of that rosin and I'll just get
off there you go and What a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: color on that once again You can see
that's just yellow All right So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the small screen in effect what
you can do with this screen is it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to clean if you do find Personally,
I don't need to use alcohol at all I find
[SPEAKER_00]: that the safest way to clean it is to take
the hash out of it once you've squeezed
[SPEAKER_00]: every last golden drop out and merely
Clean the screen by pressing the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: fold it into a small of a little chunk as
you can with nothing in it except the
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking oil that's been trapped and
Squeeze that out and you'll see that you
[SPEAKER_00]: will literally get every last drop out And
you'll have a nice clean dry screen with
[SPEAKER_00]: no stick ready to go again I would suggest
you can use these Dozens of times if not
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't personally used any single
screen a hundred times or more yet So I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to claim that but I will let you
know I've got these ones going now and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certainly no Stopping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clean up this rosin off of
here I'll let you guys know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: returns we got it looks at least like a
50% return and I will come back in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes for a dab All right guys,
so I added that all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept my two runs separately I can show
you real quick I ended up with three grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of the initial press which is right here
and here's my second press right here And
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I've often had people tell me oh,
you know the first press and the second
[SPEAKER_00]: press should never be mixed Etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree in certain cases But in a case
like this you would really have a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time noticing The color that came out the
second time was just as light as the first
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already dabbed a little bit of each
one what I total what I got total by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way was three grams of one point five of
an other when you divide that or You take
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you figure out your six grams
starting we had about a fifty eight point
[SPEAKER_00]: three percent return sixty percent pretty
darn good no complaints there and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: still got this so I can take this hash you
can do Another type of extract on it I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally prefer to do the coconut oil
extract which of course you can check out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the coconut oil hash Extraction video
that I did also for those of you that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how I got this hash I have a
whole slew of videos under the playlist
[SPEAKER_00]: water extraction as well as under the
playlist dry sift both of those Will show
[SPEAKER_00]: you two solventless ways of producing an
incredible product that if you happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any that isn't so great It's a little
bit lower than your best quality this
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin process is an absolute dream for
such things So I figured we'd do one more
[SPEAKER_00]: press like maybe a nice big press out of
this particular bag though It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit bigger than the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had I'd say you could fit One and a
half to two times the amount that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would press so let's say we do 12 grams
This time and see if we can still get 80
[SPEAKER_00]: to 90 percent of our initial yield in a
one squeeze While you know getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: last little bit out of the second squeeze,
so I'm gonna grab more bugs first I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna tear this to see exactly what we're
dealing with one gram All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Always happy to have such a nice
product to be able to share This process
[SPEAKER_00]: with you guys obviously when you're using
something that's so so which I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: happen I've had many people Asked me to
show me the process with their product and
[SPEAKER_00]: it just ends up being a real bummer Please
people understand that the better the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you start with the better product
that you will end up with this is This is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad two more grams in she goes
Let's see if that's accurate 11.6 just 0.4
[SPEAKER_00]: gram left To get that up to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I really like having the
accurate numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely something to be said 12
exactly And you can see this OG Lindsey is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a little bit lower But still
plenty of rosin squeeze out of that bad
[SPEAKER_00]: bad girl right there all right,
so We've got our 12 gram bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's gonna squeeze like you
wouldn't believe Want to make it too fat?
[SPEAKER_00]: But fat enough that it's gonna really
press that resin out of those little
[SPEAKER_00]: shells those little wax cuticle membranes
that Basically hold all of this wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: profile cannabinoids terpenes terpenoids
sesquiterpenoids the whole nine yards it
[SPEAKER_00]: all has its place and Let's get this show
on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna do a double this time
around Give it one like this and one like
[SPEAKER_00]: that a Double meaning I'm not gonna fold
the sheets that way I can just do my
[SPEAKER_00]: initial squeeze right like this
[SPEAKER_00]: and Still have good success, so let's see
if we can't get that in there All right
[SPEAKER_00]: here we go for 12 gram press Probably
gonna see it coming out the side here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll hold it up for you
[SPEAKER_00]: Lot of hash it's taken a bit of a time
before it's actually accessing and boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of those oils out and you can
see them coming out Here they come You see
[SPEAKER_00]: that drip There we go rosin drip down for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a girl Beautiful all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that lifted up This is gonna be
a huge return Absolutely wonderful you get
[SPEAKER_00]: these rosin bags out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have a nice clean
place to work I can actually see the rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping back down as I lifted that up All
right, so there's one size of our side of
[SPEAKER_00]: our sheet Probably a solid four four plus
grams just sitting there We're gonna still
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously press this out again for a
second which you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we do that right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold that up you gotta be so careful as to
not You know make any unnecessary
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes, so let me see if I can get this
back on nicely Okay
[SPEAKER_00]: try to keep these two somewhat apart from
one another not necessarily This is not
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the world if they touch Get
that back in there Give that one more
[SPEAKER_00]: length Nice little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working with this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real nice to work with All right You
can hear it squeezing out beautiful You
[SPEAKER_00]: always want to pay attention because once
you start seeing that rosin come out you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to be on the ball Otherwise it
can really make a bloody mess All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah So there's another squeeze right
there on the top And you can see it over
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well You can see it right there So
I am going to go take some macro
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs of this because I see some
real interesting stuff happening here and
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back here in a bit I have found
that it's not really the most enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to watch People cleaning these off
and so I just don't have to do that on
[SPEAKER_00]: camera But I will be back very soon to
show you some beautiful piles I'll let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we got in our first squeeze here
and what we got in our second and Whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not we're gonna have to do a third
squeeze, so we'll catch you back in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit Hey guys, so I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have squeezed out the last two batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only squeezed twice so far I got
about a 57 to 58 percent return as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got almost six grams right off the first
squeeze and then I got about one point
[SPEAKER_00]: four grams off my second squeeze for a
total of seven about seven point two seven
[SPEAKER_00]: point three still kicking around that
fifty to sixty percent range which
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically when you find a material that
you know how much return you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be very important for you to
Pay attention to those numbers because
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll let you know your efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure I could probably Squeeze these
two maybe one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could potentially get them both folded
up and squeeze out another batch now if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do such a thing keep that separate
because guaranteed by the time you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: third press the amount of heat and the
amount of taffy like sap that's gonna come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there It's just not gonna be worth
putting in with your you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really beautiful stable rosin that I mean
this stuff's gonna be absolute fire I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna shown you already But I
will show you again just in case I forgot
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that same material after a couple
of couple of months maybe maybe a month I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even remember now, but there's that
quality that we've got that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for right there really nice
transparent beautiful looking bubble and
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and easy with the bubble with the
rosin bags keep calling them bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because our first time they've come
with a little label that says bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna change you will see that say
rosin bag sooner than later And I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: really all there is left to do is to
squeeze out One of the big guys this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna require a bigger press I'm not
really comfortable squeezing it out on
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular smaller press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna have to do that on a bigger
one I think what I'll do is I'll do a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole show just for these guys right here
and in that show I'll show you both herb
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hash but for today, I think we're
pretty successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made a solid 10 grams of rosin In a
very short period of time as you saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually quite easy for me to even
collect much easier than it has been in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past off this particular type of sheet
and Like I said, we're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing this away You can still use it to
squeeze out a little bit more rosin or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want your coconut oil to have a nice
Potency to it leave that threat that third
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze in there and just run that
material through The coconut oil really
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on where your efficiency lies if
you can squeeze the rosin out of there and
[SPEAKER_00]: get every last drop Well, then obviously
that's a great idea because you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: that rosin and put it into your coconut
oil now if you're not as Efficient as you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you might be then the coconut oil
will do a really good job on getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and squeezing out every last little
bit of Phyto cannabinoids that are left in
[SPEAKER_00]: there particularly if you do the crock pot
and the water and really kind of boil it
[SPEAKER_00]: down slowly the water of course preserving
the cannabinoids and the terpenes I think
[SPEAKER_00]: really we should finish this off so you
can see I have my D nail here plugged in
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Dabinator actually at a thousand
and fifteen degrees and what I'm doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using it to clean my halo bowl each
and every hit that I take and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: if I just do a quick little unplug because
I'm going to be plugging it into the other
[SPEAKER_00]: whip anyway, you can see the quality of
cleanliness that Comes to be on the halo
[SPEAKER_00]: when you when you get it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you want your halo looking
each and every time you take a hit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that if you have one And you have
a couple of D nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great little system One turned
up to a thousand one turned up to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperature of dabbing at I've got
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 630 right now I was hitting
at 550 for a while and I felt that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: pooling a little bit I was getting very
nice tasty rips, but I felt like I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to bump it up a little bit more So why
don't we take a couple of dabs here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of our freshly made rosin, I think I'm
gonna hit this 6 gram batch right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is absolutely just phenomenal
We're only down to 810 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll talk a little bit about You
know really what this whole rosin thing
[SPEAKER_00]: means because for the longest time I've
been teaching people how to make bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash But many people were convinced that
they it was just too far away They need
[SPEAKER_00]: from their reality They needed to get bud
that they didn't have access to in large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed to get the bags they needed to
They didn't really understand the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process of water and ice and I've been
showing this to for people to people for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time And basically what has happened
now with rosin is it's so accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any bags You don't need it
You know a little bit of a screen some
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment and a hair straightener and
you're in the game and some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: even doing it without any Screen at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very easy game to get into
However, I think that you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: as you do get into it, you'll realize that
rosin isn't really necessarily the Be all
[SPEAKER_00]: end all as much as it's a really amazing
decontaminator For resins and bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for accessing dabs from bud in an
instant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just can't be beat That is an
unbelievable process to for taking hash
[SPEAKER_00]: that was otherwise a non melty grade non
dabble a 45 at 25 and 160 at once
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes 120 sometimes people's 90 and 73
or low quality this gives them another
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to recreate a product that is
actually going to be increased in quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that You know,
we can unveil the quality with bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry sifting but this rosin technique
is a whole different ballgame of like
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a quality unveiling to a next
level removing that fibrous mat and that
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuticle that wax membrane that holds those
phyto cannabinoids in place Removing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is definitely decontaminating it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although however, I will say that science
We'll probably figure out in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on in that fibrous
mat That is where of course cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes are produced and I think that
it's that that is missing from Rosin that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get in your full melt dry sift in your
full melt bubble hash hits that to me
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives the advantage to both full melt dry
sift and full melt bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two favorite Rosin is a nice
third for the quiver and a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean things up and I'm definitely I'm
stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been stoked on my D now practice I've
heard all sorts of different things people
[SPEAKER_00]: have been saying about them, but Mine's
just been nothing but a pleasure to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with and I think it's time to hit the halo
sapphire Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful that was a little bit warmer I
felt that I Haven't said at 735 but it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it's at about 6 or 635 I should
say it seemed like it went up quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started sucking there I guess I was
really cool in the nail down Possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm hitting with a cold carb cap
now talked about this as well We take so
[SPEAKER_00]: much attention of getting our product to
be as tasty as possible Try this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment leave your carb cap on the nail
just for long enough that the bottom part
[SPEAKER_00]: gets warm But the top part is still you
know easy to hold without burning yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a dab like that You will notice
that the temperature of your nail is
[SPEAKER_00]: unaltered and does not go down completely
Compared to if you use a cold carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly a titanium one it holds cold
more so than the ceramic You even cool it
[SPEAKER_00]: down more, and I've noticed it mostly in
the sapphire I've never noticed it in
[SPEAKER_00]: another nail before but the sapphire is so
sensitive and so detail attentive It's a
[SPEAKER_00]: preserver of terpenes you really have to
be careful with it And what I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit of a warmer carb cap gives
me that more full flavor That taste was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely nice, but it was Just a little
bit lacking due to the cold carb cap We'll
[SPEAKER_00]: finish it off with one more rip I'm going
to take a rip of the second batch from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same press just to see if I can notice any
differences and tastes The texture on this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular second does seem a little bit
more sappy Than solid and I think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: even kind of notice that from From looking
at it the big one is a lot more stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: the small one is it's a little bit a
little bit more sappy So we'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little rip and we'll see how that goes
let's do a little q-tip tech real quick
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys are familiar with the
q-tip tech a nice little couple of rims
[SPEAKER_00]: around there and Cleans out the majority
of that carbon Leftover and allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: take another rip without having to heat
the nail up to a thousand degrees Which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do right after this rip So
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this about that I Definitely
notice a difference in the taste now for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the stable version It was more
preserved in the terpene flavor the second
[SPEAKER_00]: batch just feels like it was exposed to
literally twice the heat that the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: batch was Exposed to and I really noticed
it in the sense that this material is very
[SPEAKER_00]: dry But when I get a really turp rich
rosin it will sizzle almost like the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen frozen Whatever John was calling
that It almost sizzled like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but differently it didn't pop and crackle
But it would literally foam and like you
[SPEAKER_00]: can maybe hear it when I took my first hit
it was just almost explosive, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: just violently bubbling and I believe that
that's definitely the terpenes present in
[SPEAKER_00]: there doing that without a shadow of a
doubt Let me put that back on full screen
[SPEAKER_00]: for you because that's just nice Nice to
have that in the background There we go
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little dab of rosin there Anyway,
I think if you guys have any questions you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hit us up You can check out the rosin
screens the rosin bags at freshheadies.com
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as bubblebag.com It's got its own
rosin tag under the categories there that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find under products and if you have
particular sizes that you're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting produced and you're not interested
in the five by four or the three by four
[SPEAKER_00]: or the one and three quarters by Three and
you want a specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: Designed screen we have no problem doing
that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pump those out pretty fast Just get
us an order minimum quotes minimum is 200
[SPEAKER_00]: singles So just let us know and we'll be
happy to help otherwise Yeah, keep
[SPEAKER_00]: watching bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try and put out a lot more
videos here I know I've been kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: the down low for putting videos out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been filming for other people lately
documentaries and other little things And
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews such that it's taken up my time
to the point where I don't have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time to offer to you guys but I
have been feeling it if you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling it and I'm gonna try and get some
more videos out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some bubble hash videos coming in
the near future with my good friend Phil
[SPEAKER_00]: and his team of guys over there at West
Coast concentrate and Who knows maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice dry sift videos in the future
as well now that we have the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures anyway, thanks for watching
my life, it's my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my life And it's your life your life
your life But if we come together for one
[SPEAKER_01]: night We're coming from behind
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing the world Our spiritual warriors
trotting from behind Trotting forward at
[SPEAKER_01]: this time So
[SPEAKER_01]: let's turn let's turn the tables Yes,
I and I come to turn the table Turn the
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm around Yes the program and
reprogram You
