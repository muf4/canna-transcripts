[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bottleman's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in beautiful Kingston,
Jamaica, although it's a little bit hazy
[SPEAKER_00]: behind us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a much bluer sky before we started
sessioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm with my business partner,
Ashley, who's here on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our guys on the ground,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bottleman's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess welcome to Kingston for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I wanted to talk a little bit about
the conference that happened recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually happened in this hotel,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was at the event center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was at the event center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I thought it was at Pegasus Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there was another ganja conference,
and I guess this one involved quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: ministers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a few ministers, a bunch of
international companies were down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bunch of grassafarian groups were
also presenting, a bunch of girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a mixture of everyone at this
event center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a two- or three-day conference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of presentations and a lot of
question-and-answer period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we were about to meet a lot of growers
on the ground and a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of information was being
derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it brought a lot of growers out of the
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it was probably,
I would say, half-growing growers there,
[SPEAKER_02]: or half-growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have loved to have made that
conference, just travel plans didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm here this week, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, good to have you all here down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, it's super exciting,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony from UCAN is with us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be seeing our partners,
John Sayers and Vivian, here on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: in Kingston as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll try to keep you guys informed
the best we can with what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in regards to the project
that we're trying to get going here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in regards to even the amendments to
the laws, and in regards to updates on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on, I just read the Observer
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's probably kind of rumors
out on the streets as well as the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's the feeling for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be another month or two?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it will get done probably by the
next month or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 to 60 days isn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, you know, I'm also in the
guessing game of one to six months because
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, it just seems kind of
too good to be true that this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're amending this drug law in
Jamaica, a country that is so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not the whole country,
but definitely, like, a good chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from this country have represented
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in a very impressive way,
you know, reggae culture, rasta culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: just promoting the sort of love and peace
and this vibe of, you know, we use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use cannabis, not cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use cannabis, not, you know,
all these other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I kind of really, I agree with that
sort of philosophy, sort of the ITAL
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pure rasta body down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, you know, it's probably 85,
90 degrees right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the same at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be loving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably have a de-nail rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're, I guess I've got to go get
the hash from over there, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We waited five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weather basically changed,
and we got the blue sky that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to hit this, Ash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, man, does that look lovely melting in
the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this, flow OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shoot when you're the goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll want to be putting that plastic
container on the, or is that one glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, mother shipping in Kingston,
couldn't be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping on introducing you guys to some new
artists that Ashley's going to turn me on
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a little bit of their
music, a little interview with H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're going to end up
seeing some ganja fields while we're here,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least a ganja field or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might meet up with some of our indoor
girl friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to hear from
Prophecy and Richie, see how those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing, and what's going on with them
and their careers, and music and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, geez, I don't know, it's only day
one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already had a ton of good fruit,
a ton of good seafood, mad dabs out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fab egg, and the sun is back in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll catch up with you guys in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to have you here with us in Kingston,
Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a joy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never leave, not since you first came
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just wait till we came back and wait
till we came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm always here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in Bubble Man's world,
you're always there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man's world is my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely, you're kind of that
wonderful sound in the background that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, for me, often, I feel that it's
almost, well, for instance, for the video
[SPEAKER_00]: we did with your song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Puffin Pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Puffin Pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys haven't seen that on Bubble
Man's world, go give that a check and
[SPEAKER_00]: share it in your social media,
because it's a real cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're monetizing it, and we're making some
money for Prophecy on that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of the monetization goes to Prophecy,
and as well as it should, because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: killer song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did that song, and when I did
that song, sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the song ahead of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the intelligence side of weed,
I was always seeing where always the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: has more than the stigma that's around
Jamaica, ganja burners, or the youth on
[SPEAKER_01]: the street side, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see it as the education,
as, you know, what you can do to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I came here, when I came in
contact with the item and find out how the
[SPEAKER_01]: TLC and the cannabis, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tricky mouthful of a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really say, yes, now I find the set of
words more really, yeah, can help me
[SPEAKER_01]: understand more about this global issue,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even an overstanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about the difference when
people are like, oh, I like how they say
[SPEAKER_00]: in some songs an overstanding more so than
an understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a great lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's a Cizna lyric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, oh, I used to overstand, but now I,
I used to understand, but now I overstand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Inna Kamozi who has a song
called Red Eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how have things been going for
Prophecy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been in the studio at all lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been working on new tracks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the studio ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still have completed about like 11
tracks already for my second album.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's started a three month and it's coming
out soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to be in the studio now from
the 7th to the 10th of February as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm completing about seven new tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to mix and mingle with the 11 tracks
on my album.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really get a balance and a feel,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like 12, but you know,
you need to have like 20 or 18 songs to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be able to flow it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the song Body Bags, We Don't Want
No Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old is that song?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that song was always with me,
but when the thing about the incursion
[SPEAKER_01]: come about, I saw the need to really push
forward and really strengthen the people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you understand me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that the voice of the voices
is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, for the title of the song,
if I told you the name of a rap song was
[SPEAKER_00]: Body Bags, it would not be a positive
song, but his reggae song, Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: My reggae song is No Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, No Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a positive song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's empowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to name that song still Rural
Resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in every way of the world,
you know, people are dying and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering and it all comes down to body
bag and toe tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go to war for the wrong reason,
homicide for the wrong reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, driving in K.R.
[SPEAKER_01]: reckless, they crash let down somebody for
the wrong reason, you understand me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I killed a girl there last night,
I killed somebody else for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Body Bags again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's basically I tell them,
We Don't Want No Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Body Bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Body Bags, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No image wrapped in white sheet with them
toe tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we speak to our own country,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we speak to Kingston because everybody,
you're in America, you're in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to come to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to go to TG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to go to Southside, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to go to Painland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to go to Seymour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even I and I were born in St. Thomas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell myself, I'm driven by
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to conquer the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come into the city, you're
fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much danger as well as there's
so much love and there's so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Kingston and they have already
killed some, so why we cry for see?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Wobbleman beg you to put this on
the church and stay towards the banner of
[SPEAKER_01]: peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to all the leaders of the world to
exercise justice, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see my innocent people get
caught in the street, Wobbleman swear on
[SPEAKER_01]: the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That he'll find a way to enlighten my
people so they can make it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to see nobody box,
nobody box, nobody box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, let's just start that song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find some more food for God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always great to have you on Wobbleman's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hear a bunch more from
Prophecy on this trip, so keep watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that sue the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the weed that by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the purpose of the weed that I
view the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed is not here to trick the mind here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down.
Let's go down.
Let's go down.
Let's go down.
Let's go down.
Let's go down.
