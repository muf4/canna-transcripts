[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, what up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Caleb in the Grill Jamaica
at the Stepping Hot Festival and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: about to try out one of his steam
chalices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can they find these?
[SPEAKER_04]: www.iteoutsteamchalice.com or www
.iteoutvaporchalice.com Wicked,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you guys got that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also find me on Facebook,
www.iteoutvaporsteamchalice.com Awesome,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll go check out Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got these beautiful steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the original vaporizer unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is using the heat from the coal,
sucking it through the clay, and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: down to the herb which is underneath,
filtering it sometimes with the water,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes with the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a nice family stick and mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how I'm going to be testing the
competition as I'm a judge and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: burn herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be hitting one of these Itel steam
vapor chalices, so keep an eye out guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the poles are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I warm it up a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get a bit of flavor off of it
because it's the fresh fresh bud and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: testing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go get my tripod.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get the first one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chalice is ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hold it?
No.
Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't stop, don't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it one more right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taste it.
Wow, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what do I have to say about number
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a little bit moist and that's why
I had to steam for a while before it
[SPEAKER_03]: really started giving me hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor was really nice, but I think
there might have been a tiny little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of fire cure going on where the
smoke from the fire got into the herb a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit and just slightly made the herb
taste like burnt firewood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still tasted the flavor of the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to go write some notes down now
and get back to you on number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now going to start with number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go give that to Caleb and
throw it in the steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sticking around with it for a bit,
Mikey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't leave, don't leave, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need you to hang with me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to blow in the shell a
little bit to get that warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to blow in the shell a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the steam pipe works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the equivalent of heating up the
nail each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because we stopped sucking on the coals
for a while, they cooled down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we need to pull on the piece a little
bit more and build that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice part of steaming how you get
that really nice rip in your head because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're constantly inhaling, exhaling,
inhaling, exhaling just to heat up the
[SPEAKER_03]: herb enough to dry out the moisture to get
the hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go with number two,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two right off the bat grabbed me
way stronger than number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much drier cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not as strong of a flavor,
but a really strong effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm on number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number three right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely my top three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, for those of you that missed
number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're ready for number three,
the Hazy OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice steam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice flavor on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smells nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: First taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, doing an old school style here
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Original steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, Jamaica takes first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, time for number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been trying everything on a steam
pipe, but we also brought the herb iron
[SPEAKER_03]: and we may just very well do some rosin
tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Soil Grown and Compassion from
ICMAG, the originator of the rosin tech
[SPEAKER_03]: milk in the resin glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil Grown is being given credit for
milking the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we might do here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: After we finish steaming all six
varieties, or seven, sorry, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: dab some, basically heat press some dabs,
some rosin out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be videoing that, so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me.
Oh, wow, that's fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
This is a steam light.
Standing in a light room.
Basically power lighting.
That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Tony's hitting the live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giddy up, what do you think of this,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy up, we'll be proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't have to smoke for the rest of
the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Paris said it got him... Number four?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll come back to the ladies in
a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb and I are going to hit number four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you hold him.
Nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: nice, nice.
That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four tasted pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bit of a fruity taste to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although number one is the best grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little bit of the acid got into
the vapes, into the herbs while you were
[SPEAKER_04]: vaping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean, clean, awesome taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how it's number two and number
three vapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, number two and three so far were my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a three I hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four...
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good, I'm going to go right down
with what I did now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's take this one out because
it's kind of confusing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is pure plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they're infused into a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, this looks nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is olive kosher, all natural,
hypoallergenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is plant fats in 5, 10s, 20s,
and 50 milligrams that are separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is THCA that comes in active or
non-active phytonabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends on the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is P2, high CBD, K, low THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is ACDC, Swiss Gold, Harlequin,
Sour Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not just like one CBD straight,
it's like five.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a one-to-one utilizing CBD
strains that are rich in CBD and cushions
[SPEAKER_02]: and indica strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's your one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black bottle means it's activated,
the white bottles mean they're inactive,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll get to why I would do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fourth one is a CBD and CBN capsule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this one is, is this one
activated, degraded, and broken down to
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN and paired with this one activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you have the combination of
activated and decarboxylated CBD and CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So collectively, when you take a five,
a five, a five, and a five, that's my
[SPEAKER_02]: stacking program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out of a Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You now can stack your phytonabinoids and
your cannabinoids, and it's non-active and
[SPEAKER_02]: activated and decarboxylated format.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could do fives, one week,
tens, the next, 20s, 40s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be like a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start using as a chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all in to an EHR software that
we're doing here, and we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-clinicals and clinicals on these to
make sure that they're safer than Tylenol,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm not good enough with 114 times
safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want 100 times safer than Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea here is that instead of
promising someone a magical strand,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a combination of sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these are just capsules, so that's
your immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have sublinguals, and the
sublinguals allow you to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: inactive and raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can do the locking of things for
your central nervous system and your
[SPEAKER_02]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have seven different notes,
like a piano or a guitar, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatic notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have those notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I create actinols with the program
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I create actinols, cannabinoids,
and sequencing charts depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's ailment.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an example, if you were insomnia and
you couldn't sleep, there's a 20-milligram
[SPEAKER_02]: P4 that has your name on it that'll allow
you to sleep eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're sensitive to it and you
slept 14 hours, switch to the sublingual
[SPEAKER_02]: drops and use two at a time, four at a
time, and slowly key in your dose,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then let me know if that's what you
need, because then we can key that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could do a time-release transdermal
gel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have problems sleeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you haven't even gotten to amazing
yet.
This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the P4.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the P4 transdermal gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, this doesn't smell like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like a patch, but you just rub
it on so nobody knows you're wearing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a clear gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sits on your skin, and I can make this
time-release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is CVD8 and CVM combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: And each transdermal goes into the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Release arthritic pain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sublinguals, you can boil,
so you're inactive, and you can take them
[SPEAKER_02]: home and boil them in water, and you can
activate them, because boiling water is
[SPEAKER_02]: 229.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside the little container, you're
hitting the 284 mark, which is what
[SPEAKER_02]: activates THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lighter is 451, baking is 350.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things kill all the medicinal
properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about raw foods,
it's 118 degrees and below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with cannabis, anything under the
300 mark, you start to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cannabinoids,
and there's a clear medicinal about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But terpenes boil off at 96, 104,
114, 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start changing molecules,
and those are modulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do a full plant, full profile
extraction on a plant with all 40
[SPEAKER_02]: priorities addressed, and the terpenes
pull back out and put back into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're on number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that haven't seen number
five, she's going into the cellar pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number five as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stick a little more in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You getting some good photos?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have him light up this.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, mine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my phone blew up till it died.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back with Caleb, and we're back with
number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get rid of that light behind us there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go, get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hold it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble man, make this motherfucker bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice flavor on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice reaction on that one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great expectorant properties on that
strain right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, number five, really grabbed me by
the throat, peppery in my nose,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost making me want to sneeze.
You should give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I'd have to concur.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tastes like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is, see in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got number six right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm number six right here, and I'm going
to take one more vape out of five.
Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, next up, number six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do five?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I just did five.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just dropped our coals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have tongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on six now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tony's finished all seven strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've finished five, I've done six and
seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: We photographed them all, and if we have
enough time, we're going to do a little of
[SPEAKER_03]: the parchment trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least try it with one bud, and if it
works and we get a dab each, then I
[SPEAKER_03]: suspect we'll whip through the other six
and get a dab with each one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the torch right here,
got the mothership with the quartz bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could happen, I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parchment's even ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this one right now.
Actually, who's two?
I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to tell you it's going to take
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on six?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're on six.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is number six right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite a head.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting nice, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we picked 735, and the actual people
who speak to us here with our quantum
[SPEAKER_02]: cams, and they actually test results with
735 as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: 735 through the quantum cams, 735 through
bubble man and tongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're picking according to their
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number seven, number three, and five.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this, seven, three, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know nothing other than that
you are five, seven, three, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to find out who
you know gave number seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tell us what's three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that controversial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can tell us what's three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it controversial?
[SPEAKER_02]: They correspond.
[SPEAKER_02]: They correspond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So correspond to what people think too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test comes down to who judged the
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accordingly, based upon your experience,
based upon your knowledge, based upon your
[SPEAKER_01]: history with dealing with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last word is from the individual
with your experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave us an identical reading as what
the computer did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it gives you a good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't, we can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I gave you a human radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it's somewhere between 10% or 11%
and 14%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the test results were between
9.5% and 13%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right up to the core of what you said,
THC level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the reading of the computer
was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we represented good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know who.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Negril, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stepping High Festival 12th Annual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, let's go to the room now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
