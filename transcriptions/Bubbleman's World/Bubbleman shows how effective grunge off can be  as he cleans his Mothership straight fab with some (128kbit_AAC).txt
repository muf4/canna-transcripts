[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Pogo Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gearing up for my trip to the
Cooties tomorrow, and I have decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean out my mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the ways I clean the mothership
is with a product called Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always use isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I'm in a rush, I'll throw
the isopropanol in and give it a shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use rock salt, but I don't
really find it necessary as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I use this product here called
Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very cool product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a product similar to it
that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oil that you can buy at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a smaller, more expensive version
that's sold to the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a friend of mine that owns the
company, and I like to give him support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check out Grunge Off if you get a
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reusable, so right off the bat,
I'm going to take this little bit that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got in the bottle, and we're going
to pour it right back into the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is very soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when it's dirty, it's still very
soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of keeps it, even if I have
a little spill just there, it really keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: it from, like when isospils, it becomes
very sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's step one, empty the Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this bottle is quite dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see some of the resin that's
left over, but it has stripped the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the resin out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn my hot water tap on,
and then we're merely just going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot water through the bong,
clean out the Grunge Off, and the bong
[SPEAKER_00]: should be about 99% clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of quick rinses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so usually give the outside of the
bong a bit of a wipe down with a cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've grunged it off, I find that the
Grunge Off is very slippery stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to leave it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few little marks on the inside
of the down stem, which I'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean out nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty darn nice job, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little shout out to the
Grunge Off people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great product that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've reused this personal bottle of Grunge
Off a hundred plus times, and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great product, Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
