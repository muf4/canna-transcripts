[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have left my lab a little early today
and I have headed out up in smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may or may not recognize it from the
last video I put up, but apparently our
[SPEAKER_01]: hazel all hash joints, no paper,
no glue, no cannabis, pizza without the
[SPEAKER_01]: box if you will, are now available and I
wanted to support THC this time around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they did not order them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to go back up in smoke,
support Max and Dom as they've always done
[SPEAKER_01]: great things here in Vancouver under their
old legacy brand dispensary that they used
[SPEAKER_01]: to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they've transferred into the legal
market and like you've seen in the video
[SPEAKER_01]: from previous, the Hank that I bought,
they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's go check out some hazels,
pure hash joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time on the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time in British Columbia in the
legal framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my friends have been making
these joints for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but never been able to go into a store and
buy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the hazel right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm pretty stoked to be buying
these hash joints right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to do just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to find somewhere heady to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a nice bench we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll push through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen, I'm here with Dom from up in
smoke, AKA the meme dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what you do with your hash
that's not dabble?
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking roll hazels with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hazel right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little THC symbol on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even seen this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to unwrap it here together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to smoke our own for
COVID safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not the safest thing to do past
joints around right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit irresponsible,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, we've each bought our
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty stoked on the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I paid, would you say about 27
bucks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 27 bucks each.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is within the range.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's a little bit cheaper than
the price that these were back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were available through
compassion clubs and legacy markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can confirm or not confirm with me in
the comment section of this video to let
[SPEAKER_01]: me know what you, what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'm going to try and open this
bad boy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had like the, just kind of wrapped up
in these little, little tubes almost
[SPEAKER_01]: tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got to open up the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like where you push the sides,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are really tough to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that for a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pinch all three sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, just pinch the sides
really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any LPs watching this, these are
literally the worst containers that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage, I'm looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not very friendly to people with
hand issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, for us, this was chosen to
try and get the product to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best, best ideal packaging,
but it has secured the hash joint in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that the hash joint is not broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess, yeah, you light yours up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hayward and Cheryl,
the creators of the Hazel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really proud of you guys and stoked to
see you having this product come to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty darn cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just slide that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy to light these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of start heating them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter and they'll just catch
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like it's just going to keep
itself going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real nice, nice look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alpha Cedrine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that for a terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta Caryophylline, Beta Mersene,
Alpha Cedrine, and Beta Humuline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really speak Terpeneese,
but it does smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't speak Terpeneese?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, Dom, I thought you were like legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cultivar is the Death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to borrow your lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do ask that you hold it in your hand
and light it, just the way Dom was
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding in your mouth and lighting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fairly big hole down the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hold it in your mouth and light
it, you could suck the flame in and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the most ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke joints very often,
but when I do, they are pure hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a half gram is a lot for one person,
but I think it's the perfect amount for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and Marcus here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to smoke the whole gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're down in these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to sit here for at least 20 more
minutes and smoke this joint while people
[SPEAKER_01]: honk, while instructions going on,
while people are trying to bash back into
[SPEAKER_01]: their parking spots right in the core of
the city here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea on the shades, Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a, it's doing the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect by the end of it will be pretty
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mission, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the mission, but I'm more
impressed with just like the integrity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual hash tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd think with the heat
passing through it, it might soften up or
[SPEAKER_00]: start melting at the end, but this stays
really nice and firm and it's smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although you may think the majority of
the hash is burning off on this joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke them, you really get the
idea that you are indeed inhaling a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who loves that old school taste
of hash in a joint, this is the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: With no paper and no glue and no cannabis,
I call it pizza without the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got that closed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as hard to close as it was to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cannabis people and we did spend
enough time in the legacy that of course
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the natural way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever looked at new people who
are coming into the industry, who are just
[SPEAKER_01]: so gung ho and excited and God bless their
hearts for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've lived for some decades in the
industry and you get, you get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Dom said, the packaging,
this isn't the best packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did get us to market, but let's be a
little bit more conscious in the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have difficulty opening things
and hopefully, you know, change things up
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that is just burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to get this shirt changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hash melts except when it's hazel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy these at concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'll tell you when I stopped smoking
joints and it was like, okay, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I going to do a vape pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, a pen is not going to
hit you like a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, well, am I going to
sneak in my torch and my rig and my dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember actually, I went to a Michael
Franti concert in Stanley park at Malcolm
[SPEAKER_00]: goal and I had a big, like at the time it
was red eye because it was not Eddie at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just gone out of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this 2005?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who opened up for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reggaetonists, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish reggae band.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I went there and I brought my two
foot, like red eyed glass bong with me
[SPEAKER_00]: through security and then had to like
bargain with them to let me keep it as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as I didn't smoke it inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that was that's who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was bringing my bong to the concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to be at that concert,
but I got the call the night before that
[SPEAKER_01]: my father and his wife were killed in a
motorcycle accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very suddenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the worst moments of my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the day that that concert
happened, I ended up on a plane to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to Winnipeg to deal with, you know,
the things that you have to deal with as
[SPEAKER_01]: you get older, when your parents are dying
or siblings or, you know, heavy shit
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes happens in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I knew the minute he mentioned that
Michael Franti concert, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to Michael Franti, no matter where he
is, whether it's Whistler, whether it's at
[SPEAKER_01]: Malcolm bowl, whether it's in an indoor
venue in Vancouver, I would be at that
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only one I missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a powerful show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard I remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful, sunny afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started pouring down rain in the middle
of the set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just started covering up all the
electronics and everyone just started
[SPEAKER_00]: dancing harder and started singing harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like this crazy,
crazy vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not many concerts that had so many
people really all on the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great venue to like not very many
people know Malcolm bowl in Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you visited Stanley Park, you for sure
won't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could live in the city for many,
many, many years and not know that Malcolm
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl is literally smack dab in the middle
of this park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this really cool kind of
amphitheater little field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just that when you walk in
there, you know that like something
[SPEAKER_01]: special could possibly happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like it's great, great spot for
a venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like they're one major.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice outdoor concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing good on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have smoked this much faster than I
normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even at 10 minutes, Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be like honest, like I'm
super, super critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if there's anything that I can taste
on the on the inhale, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: bitterness or anything like I'll,
I'll be the first to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't get much negative taste out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smooth at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest not squeezing it too hard
because you can pop it into a pipe and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now towards a roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine is actually still completely perfect
in every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't to, it hasn't crushed out,
but that right there happens a lot when
[SPEAKER_01]: you pass them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get that one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust the integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't squeeze it.
It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but this is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's got a clean burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not really getting any
bitterness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's nothing kind of foul there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the input material was decently clean
for this bubble and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not melty because it
doesn't need to be melty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't be able to make a hash joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the first rip would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would just, you'd have to put
it in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put like melty hash in,
put it on the inside of the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have had some, I have had some
people tell me that they're putting things
[SPEAKER_01]: on the inside of these joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people in, um, Ontario the other day,
I was on a PK session with one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stores there and they said, yeah,
we filled it up with Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just stuffed it full with a toothpick
and packed it full of Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, man, that thing burnt
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So experiment, play around, have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really stoked mostly for, for like the
most for Hayward and Cheryl, the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who really made this product and brought
it to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought it under our brand and we
brought it under our company name and we
[SPEAKER_01]: partnered up with them, but they did the
legwork on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the coolest old school couple from
the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have time, give a little shout
out in the comment section to Hayward and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheryl and I'll make sure I show it to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm officially burning my fingers and it's
still going, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how small I can get this one
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pure hash joint from Hazel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big thanks to up and
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have been doing it right here
in the city for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go buy new products, I want to make
sure I head over to some of the shops that
[SPEAKER_01]: spent time in the legacy market,
give them support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I just, I've always
appreciated what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always appreciated the, uh, you know,
the fun videos we've done and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've pressed a lot of hash together now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a few years of doing this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go through this channel,
you'll definitely see more than a few
[SPEAKER_01]: videos with, uh, with Dom and his partner,
Max went pressing Rosin at my house or
[SPEAKER_01]: just, uh, on the boat with Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of, that was a fun day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost forgot about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried going out to Bowen, but the,
but the water, the weather wasn't letting
[SPEAKER_00]: us, we turned around, didn't we went to
the day instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to embark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hazel and a shout out to all
of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just puffed a grandma hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got my extra one, but I want to
buy another one and maybe, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it away a little bit of giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen, everybody, thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Hazel hash joint review.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get yours here in
Vancouver, I know that up in smoke still
[SPEAKER_01]: has a few left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, head on down there to 58 West
Broadway, West Broadway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that one tasted like another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to buy one more smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
