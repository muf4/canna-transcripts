[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live Facebook session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requested by my friend Allison,
who said, I wish you were live right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, alright, done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, we're live.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Allison Gordon Facebook
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you're in here, Allison Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see you, but Jared Scully's in the
house, so I will say hello, hello to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's time for a little
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this little mothership piece here,
this little guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little sub-eight inch Klein with a
honey bucket, lemon drop on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured, why don't we have a nice
little session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Dustin Halderson, and welcome
Jared Scully, and welcome resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we have no shortage of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of the good stuff right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome John Balak, CJ Tracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time, what do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we get it going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we make it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, she finally showed up for her
special, for her only Facebook live
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Mason, very, very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new mothership, Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rip is gonna be for you,
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my dab already turp dipped over
here in some Jack Frost, I believe we went
[SPEAKER_00]: into, Jack Frost turpings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a whole selection here, beautiful,
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to see some of you guys in Spain in
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be coming in Spain, and I may,
may, may, may, may, may, may be selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership while I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're there, come by my booth,
check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have the Sasquatch guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be with Javi for medical
seeds, and it's gonna be pretty much a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful, epic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come to Spain, I think it's gonna be
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I excuse me for turning on this torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's gonna be loud and obnoxious,
but it needs to, it needs to be done,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's see if we, oh, actually,
before we do that, let's do this real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and get this timer that I wanted to
get on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hope you are coming to Spain,
it's gonna be very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got any Daven solo rigs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any Daven solo rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go, we got this timer
launching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activity timer, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have the timer on my phone,
I use it all the time, but I gotta say,
[SPEAKER_00]: as for those of you that don't know,
when you're heating up this quartz,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very nice to know how long you heated
it up for, which tells you how long you
[SPEAKER_00]: should cool it down for, and then makes
for the cleaning to be very much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I looked at the price of this
particular dial just with this quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: banger, which is the Megapod, which you
can see there with the seed of life carved
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive for this little unit,
850 US dollars without the bucket or the
[SPEAKER_00]: OFC, so you wanna take care of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Michael Manning from Blue River,
welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess really all there is to do now is
see if that timer actually opened up,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if it didn't, I'm gonna have to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you go, timer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even see the timer, I know I just
added it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activity timer, oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I gotta set this thing,
I've never done this before, so bear with
[SPEAKER_00]: me while I figure out how to set the
length, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 minutes, that seems a little bit long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go with 55 seconds, how about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get this done here, sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really discussing, hey,
welcome Roy Richardson in from Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's getting crazy, Justin,
it is getting fucking crazy, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can start this point one,
okay, so dude, dude, 55, so that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get this show on the
road, I wanna have a bong work with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do 25 minutes, yeah, that's a pretty long
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Johnny, Juan Andres Rodriguez and
Christian Biro, you're just in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just about to get this fucking party
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about how loud the torch is,
I know it's obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my bong cleaner right here that I'm
gonna show you guys, this new cleaner that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I showed on Hash Church,
the dark city, dark glass, dark crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: glass from Mick out in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's just get this nicely heated
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get it nicely evenly heated
up, then we will hit start on the timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: biding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 50 seconds or so, I will have my
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you do it right there,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I dipped my turps, let me tell
ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good, I'm glad that the audio wasn't
so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that often torches just pick up
terribly on these microphones,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real dabbers understand the sound,
true story right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have ordered myself up a nice
glass dabber from Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if you guys check him out on
Instagram, but he's a pretty good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my next big project?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right now I'm actually looking
online for buildings in Vancouver to lease
[SPEAKER_00]: or purchase a space to do a huge bubble
man's world experience, vape lounge,
[SPEAKER_00]: high end glass gallery to do high end
glass shows, really nice restaurant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, whatever it can be from
there, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we got six seconds left,
so everyone ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can get this a little straighter
so you can actually see the bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the vape exhale, don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually have it plugged in and ripping
it out, but after getting this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, I just can't say enough about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an exciting idea, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how dirty we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give it a little cleanup with
the Q-tip, but you'll see there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: some dirt in there, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we dip in this cleaning
solution right in there, nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice amount on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this part will trip you right out,
because we're going right in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this shit's gonna bubble up and froth
up, and it basically cleans the quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: like nothing I have ever seen any cleaning
agent do, and it's completely natural,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can drink the shit, it's based on
coconut oil and carunga oil, and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show the cleaner again,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mark, sorry I'm late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, Spencer, we're happy that you
finally made it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple more, and then you can see
just how clean I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: So amazing, amazing cleaner, and I will
show that again right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: No alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exceptional resin lifting power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark crystal glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it is is it's non-chlorinated
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carunga oil, processed coconut
extract, processed kelp extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: and processed extract of sugar cane,
so they got some method that they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, but I'll tell you what,
there's no smell, there's no taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: even once you clean it off, most of it's
water, and so the water steams,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess it's the oil inside the water
while it's steaming that lifts and picks
[SPEAKER_00]: up the resin, so wipe the outside of your
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wipe the outside of it sometimes,
not always, when it gets, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when resin surrounds it a lot,
I take this little guy, and I'll just give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a nice outside clean, probably every
like second or third rip, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that help with my shower head for
reals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed what you were asking about your
shower head, but man, I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving this tiny little mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how big this thing is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my torch is almost bigger than it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small little dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to talk and clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whatever, I'm just saying this stuff
is great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sharing it with you, whether you
like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to clean glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, it's to pay a lot of money
for quartz, and I want it to be new every
[SPEAKER_00]: time I hit it, and it's a bummer when you
ruin it, when you burn too much material
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People hit it hot, they don't clean it
properly, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it could, Spencer,
I have seen some thermal shock do some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty incredible things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can heat this stuff up and boil it,
and then put bangers into it, and he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just picks the resin right off the
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the size on it, Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 7.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.9 for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what they call a sub-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely for the people that are
looking for, you know, heady mothership
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, it seems that a lot of people are
looking for smaller than taller pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine inches and up, you're certainly not
going to get the same amount of people
[SPEAKER_00]: bugging you for a piece as eight inches
and below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up, straight out of the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turp Burpin, I like that Turp Burpin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you know, I'm Turp Burpin over here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my Flavas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see what flavors we have in
the house today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start off with some Stardog
from Blue River Extracts right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog, super cushy, incredible flavor on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset Sherber, I can't even describe
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, yeah, it's got this cushy,
also very deeply cushy, but something
[SPEAKER_00]: different, like very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Tangy, what needs to be said
about the Tangy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's citrus explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that smells it, whether they're
like cannabis or not, will have something
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have a big appreciation for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clementine is very different in the
sense of it's a citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to Tangy, but it just has
these completely different undertones
[SPEAKER_00]: following that citrus blast that you get
when you initially smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who doesn't love some Jack Frost?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never had it, you got to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: BlueRiver.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: BlueRiverExtracts.com ships to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very happy with the new order of terpenes
that will hit the website here in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just been loving it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terp, dip, and bong, rip, and fuck yeah,
as D420K would say on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom was tripping the other day on why
my house stunk like citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried so many different cleaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably noticed if you've watched my
channel for any amount of time that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never, out of all the years I've been
smoking these, have I hit from these
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership quartz bangers because I always
felt like it was too fast to destroy them
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, $850 just for this quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dial, that becomes so expensive that
you want to be able to be able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got this cleaning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry it around in these 4.5 mLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bottle is huge, 650 mLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think I'm going to do is I'm
going to probably put, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five mLs in each one of these,
put a nice little sticker on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it with a little pack of Q-tips and
just sell it for like a buck or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to try and make money, but just to try
and like get people access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I'll make a bunch of free samples
of these with the first couple of bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just send them out to people and
say, hey, look, if you like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, thanks for trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on Colorado's social clubs
coming soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't spend any time in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of friends there,
but I really don't have my finger on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pulse at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely have my finger on the pulse in
Vancouver and I only live 25 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of that city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel that Vancouver's blowing up
though, you know, for our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so many dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vapor lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time for a real high end
place to come in and offer something that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody else is offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, red Congolese is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma's bitch is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset Sherber's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender skunk is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Micron, Mike Micron in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time for us to probably blaze
one more bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Alison Gordon session.
[SPEAKER_00]: She requested this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everyone should at least say,
hello to Alison or perhaps something else
[SPEAKER_00]: of sorts, but she's in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is her Facebook live that she
requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should at least thank her probably
for, if you're enjoying this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook live, she's the reason it's
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turpdip bong wrap, open rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to go with some
Clementine this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Dolph BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bishop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone say hello to Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alison's a very helpful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm sure I'll be seeing her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, who knows when I'll see her next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably sooner than later, March maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's about to join you on this hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hello to Rob as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone because he's probably sitting
right next to Alison and they're both top
[SPEAKER_00]: notches in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if you're going to join
me on this one, Rob, let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how's it going, Rob?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this rip is for you and Alison and
it's turpdip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you, you'd be all over
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wouldn't give you a migraine
headache because let's be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me hit this timer real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having the timer app on my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can I find that mothership?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership is like mothershipglass.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of different resellers,
depending on if you're in Canada or
[SPEAKER_00]: America, they're all over America on the
East coast, West coast, interior Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple, one in the West coast
here, high integrity glass art,
[SPEAKER_00]: one on the East coast, which is like a
high priority glass art or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or join a mothership for sale group on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also punch in mothership glass for
sale hashtags on Instagram and find all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of different pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to get to know, you know,
to not be too much of a newbie before you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it, but they do have it set up so you
can buy them used pretty safely if,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like Frenchies agitator
machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't seen it myself yet,
but it looks like a double jacketed
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on my own stainless
steel unit for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had any comments really,
cause I don't want to give up what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing myself, but we've been working with
the patent owner to produce a large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial industrial water extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ro is where I get a lot of my glass for my
high integrity glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also tons of people selling,
you know, like Ro would not be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you know, a Taurus or an egg or a
Klein or there's many different ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: he doesn't have right now, but you could
potentially find them in these mothership
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just might be a little more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm buying a piece off Ro tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, quite excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be showing you guys that one on the
next Facebook live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold my Taurus recently, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good solvent list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, wherever they sell West Coast
concentrate would be one good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go check out Sunrise Wellness
Center because I know they sell pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: fiery stuff from Concentrated X and
Heavenly Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly Rosin, I think maybe a little bit
of Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrise Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm not sure if you, you might
want to hit up West Coast Concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast Concentrates and find out where
they sell their product in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What shops, et cetera, because I don't
know the names of the shops, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: they make fire material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some West Coast Concentrate Rosin
that I've been blasting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's good enough for me,
I think it's good enough for you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your next door buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to buy a house next door to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Brandon Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well with you and yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish well upon everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a good
holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Hash Church 118 is coming up and I
don't know how I'm going to fit it in on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to be a Christmas Eve thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a Christmas night thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't figured it out yet, but I'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll look up the Jews for Santa and
find out if they can offer me any advice
[SPEAKER_00]: because my friend Allison, of course,
is one of the, she's the East Coast head
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chapter, Jews for Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag Jews for Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a personal joke between the
two of us and of course all of her friends
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check her out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays, Jews for Santas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good rip there,
Robbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to hear back from you,
but I don't know if you were dabbing or
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling up a joint or whatnot,
but I hope it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised you don't have a
solvent-less stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely surprised you don't have
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are just like important to have
in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to make a little Christmas
donation over that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Merry Christmas, Justin and Angel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about an all-day Hash Church?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, I think you could do it for
about nine hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put the link on my Facebook and let
anyone who clicks on it come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be quite something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite something indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, for sure, Jared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I don't care how many
live people watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cool when seven or eight or
900 people are watching, but I do these
[SPEAKER_00]: shows even if like three people watch just
knowing that other people were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: watching later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had my Christmas dinner with the
Fresh Heddy's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my employees take them up for a
beautiful dinner and let them bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: spouses or special someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, give them all nice bonuses and
just, yeah, we shared some nice vibes
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight and had a really nice dinner with
the team, with Fresh Heddy's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good team going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company is almost 20 years old,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble bags have been sold around the
world since 1999 and we're entering 2017,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's only a couple more years before
we're in the 20th year of Fresh Heddy's
[SPEAKER_00]: and bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're most welcome, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that people are enjoying it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe that we're still doing it
two years plus later, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's unbelievable,
but hey, if everyone's loving it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if everyone's enjoying it and the people,
most importantly, the panelists are
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to come on, because we all have
very unique personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'll see some people who used
to come on aren't coming on anymore and
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have never come on are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fresh, you know, you gotta
keep the seats moving and keep the people
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in fresh, because obviously,
that's what makes it exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting new people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did Hash Church change when Indra
came on or when Dr. Natasha came on or
[SPEAKER_00]: when, you know, all these different people
that just started making appearances?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, Hash Church is incredible in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas to you and your bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very nice to see Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given him a renewed vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that he really is excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that he likes being recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that he likes the respect that
people are giving him, and in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super well-deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guy's a super awesome,
conscious, incredible dude who also
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to have given so much to the
community and has incredible stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of inspiration to be had
listening to Indra, let's just say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I feel beyond blessed that he decided
to come on to Hash Church and share all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this shit, these guys haven't
done this before ever in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have never gone out and put
themselves out there the way they're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting themselves out there on Hash
Church, the way they're sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he did hook up with
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he was going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should try and, I should, I text with
Indra almost every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day, so I'll make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Todd says it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't know how these guys all
became my friends, but I kind of feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to text with Indra and Skype
with Sam and Chimera and Rob Clark and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these wonderful people that are really
just my peers and my friends from the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't realize it when you're in
it, and then you look back and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, whoa, I've known these guys for
20-plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so there it is on this Monday
at 9.55.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: December 19th?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was recognized by his voice exactly,
Norman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's so cool that that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, it made my hair on my arms stand
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so happy for him, like as I'm happy
for, you know, Todd and Etienne and Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of those guys that give their all
and share on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deserve to be recognized by their
peers and the people that are watching
[SPEAKER_00]: them and enjoying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be able to first,
you know, they're super humble dudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so approaching them is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting them is only going to be pretty
much an enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's just well-deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I could have Hash Church,
Mark Emery on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to invite him and Jody on,
Jody's been on Hash Church before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure Mark ever has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to have him on and talk about
prison and whatnot and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll definitely hit both Mark and Jody
up and put a, you know, a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation out to have them on Hash Church
and see if they want to come talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Montreal, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm happy to have people like Hilary
Black and, you know, Joel from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the main growers from Aurora or any
of these other people, stoked,
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most thank you, Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell Miss Bubbleman happy holidays
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good that you're liking it, Chate and
Robbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not too shabby, but I have to say,
I think I'm going to go and chill out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a couple of good dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just rambled off like 28,000 words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably going to go get a drink so I can
swap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says my connection's weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I made it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went frozen for a long time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of tripping out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I made it back because I
want to have a good video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Stevie Hughes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I made it back for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice would make a good narrator for a
documentary?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone do a documentary and then serve me
up some words and I'll read them and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be the narrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I froze, but I stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to let you guys go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I push through and I move
around my office a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did because I'm holding my phone
now if you noticed, I brought you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought you guys back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No weak internet connection is going to
stop Bubble Man from talking to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: out in Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are those people and I appreciate
all of you and I wouldn't have been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to say hello to Alexander Rapetzky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm so glad I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Alexander.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ben Warden in the house, LOLing all
the way to the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man is too much, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was my connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woot, woot, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a hoot, hoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't mind, Stevie,
but I am hitting the lemon drop mega pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare, but it's happened, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got into a little bit of this
torch action, so don't hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the full party's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little rosin dab and
we're going to do a little turp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this time we're going to turp dip
into, oh, let's say Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more puff we are having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, everything is very well, Alexander.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dipping into the Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hit some Clementine before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Jack Frost before that or
Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a blur, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a blur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get some new, like, little,
this thing is so heavy it just closes or
[SPEAKER_00]: falls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, this smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even like coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail is escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail's trying to get away on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, don't you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you try to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm getting her done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon drop, the OG original UV reactive
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good eye, Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to open one in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did this bubble man space and it was
a high end gallery and had the restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: and had, you know, bubble man's world,
maybe like a studio where I could film out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a nice little restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would definitely have a Blue River
store and it would be the first I would
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect in North America that you could,
uh, that you could purchase Blue River
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes in a little special area of the
store where, you know, we'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: well-trained people that could explain the
different terpenes, show you the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: makeups, offer you vape exhale,
cure terpene rips without cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I think it would be really
pimped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I've been talking about with
a potential investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually torch that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you wondering, I was just
really cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obsessive compulsive with cleaning
this nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like have a real nice high end
little like clean terpene corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the vape lounge, have, you know,
the shop that sells all the hash making
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, maybe build a hash lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost like a room that's,
you know, like a walk-in freezer with a
[SPEAKER_00]: big glass window where people could come
in and be like, Oh, bubble man's in,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's making hash right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk in and you can watch him,
or we'll have it playing on TVs in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the place where I'll be dry sifting or
wet washing or making raws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll have it set up with mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to talk and explain and give
tips as I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course people, if they're
inspired, by it, they can either buy those
[SPEAKER_00]: tools or they can go home and make their
own tools for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me, I'm still going to share all
my ideas with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you how to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the screen sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do, I'll tell you whatever you need
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be inspiring and I want to make
hash in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to, I want to be able to do
that in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that's, uh, um,
I don't use the torch more than the D now
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, like at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the D now like religiously,
even on planes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that shit plugged in for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you will, Alison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me that space wouldn't be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me people wouldn't travel to be like,
I heard there's this motherfucker in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada that has this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a pimped out vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a studio in there for filming
with a green room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got this hash lab that's on a walk-in
freezer with a giant glass window that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go up and look right in, or you can
watch it on giant TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful vapor lounge, high end glass art
gallery, super high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art gallery with special mothership shows,
team Japan shows, you know, Marcel and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Lee shows, whatever marble slinger
and Paco fucking or a Philly show with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philly artists, like something that
would be super inspirational for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of being one single component
that might not be enough to keep it really
[SPEAKER_00]: flourishing and alive, add all of those
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do a Facebook or a live YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Robert, when I'm in there making
hash once a week or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: have it as a subscription base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's serious people that really want to
get the information because I'm ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: start giving it out again and I'm ready to
start doing things that are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different than most the things that I see
that are being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Vancouver's a great spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it happening in LA soon after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I mean, I would love to
push the boundaries and have some small
[SPEAKER_00]: little private type thing in Whistler that
would be just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll start with Vancouver and we'll
see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, I put three years into the
melting point and I think, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like it to be called bubble man's
world, but the gallery will be the melting
[SPEAKER_00]: point or the, you know, all of these
different aspects that I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about since the melting point because I
first had the melting point back in 2003
[SPEAKER_00]: when I had my raw food cafe, my vapor bar,
my high end glass gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these things I've already done
like over 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Vancouver, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a bit of everything under one
roof, a really amazing immaculate space
[SPEAKER_00]: that was built to fit all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: High end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want Coca-Cola and chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to be like your average
vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be something that people can
really feel comfortable going to the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they would a nice restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a little bit into my mind of
some ideas that I've been having figured I
[SPEAKER_00]: might as well share it with you guys and
get a little bit of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you could see coming in the
upcoming year, 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, Spencer, I would
definitely talk to all my glass friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that had beautiful glass and try to bring
them in to be a part of it in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape or form, at least for the gallery
aspect to make sure all the best glass in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like the idea of the gallery buying
and selling glass, you know, having a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk of money put aside so we can buy
heady pieces to put in the gallery without
[SPEAKER_00]: having anyone's shit on consignment and
being able to sell that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate that we want to without a
rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty damn cool, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should finally let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last rip was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my beautiful wife is waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, with children,
we only get a very few hours every night
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang out and chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will thank you all for your time
hanging out here in bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for letting me bounce my ideas
off you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for your positivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for the most part, you guys are
all pretty damn positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see too much negativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great night, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And happy holidays if I don't talk to you
before the big day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do, well, we will talk to you
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is brought to you care of Alison
Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the inspiration for this chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give her thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
