Hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: welcome to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a beautiful day it is today in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Wednesday, which is Puff Wednesday,
but I had John message me yesterday and
[SPEAKER_04]: tell me that he's not going to be able to
make Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, I was completely blown away
at the idea of not having Puff Wednesday
[SPEAKER_04]: with John, so I asked him what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's got a bit of a journey today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's shipping off some of his mother
plants to one of the companies that he's
[SPEAKER_04]: been hired to work with, one of the
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's helping them get some strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm going to go over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a little session.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go down to Green Planet and
wrap these mothers up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go down to Mega Ill Pizza
for a nice little session, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a D-Nail session and a pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to make our way down
to the airport and we're going to send
[SPEAKER_04]: these strains off to, I'm not even sure
where, but I'm sure John will let us know
[SPEAKER_04]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, listening to John Nine's new
album, New Name.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pick that up on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can listen to it on SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet, sweet new reggae artist who's just
really... I'm digging her tunes a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: these days, so I figured I'd have a little
hitman rip with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my baby cakes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some D420K Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren always tells me he loves when I
mention his Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mention it because it's
wonderful stuff and I mention it because
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking it often.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we have a little rip here?
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess really going to pack up,
make our way down to John's and go have a
[SPEAKER_04]: session with John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see you in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just arrived here at John's place,
so why don't we go check out what he's up
[SPEAKER_05]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny!
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, yo, Johnny!
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, it's... Johnny, Johnny G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I can smell... Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, he's still got smoke in the fucking
bon.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to clear John's morning
hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet!
[SPEAKER_04]: What are friends for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go see him out in his grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing that's where he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does like to spend a lot of time out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: As makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was a good bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to ask him what that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, ADT secured.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is where we're going to find
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny!
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I just finished your bong rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a bunch of smoke in your bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesday over at Johnny's place this
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finished cutting these clones there
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we have some Medi Kush,
of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right there would be the Hoss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I got Haley's Comet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here would be the Taha Oji.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taha Oji over in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck, we've got ourselves a great
day planned here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to start with a little
session.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's go in the house and get lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, bro, I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I'm going to grab John.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go in the house,
have a session.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might come back out here and do a
little tour of his Jardin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll go off and have some
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made it up to John's kitchen,
and he's about to show me his fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you done with your fridge here,
John?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's happened is the top isn't
working properly, so the freezer works
[SPEAKER_04]: quite well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fans weren't out, so it keeps it
nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a fridge downstairs for
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best part about this fridge is
because it's my 420 fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, I got all my different
hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my caps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my Haley's that I bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I like how you have all your hash on
the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the killers right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we pull something off this top
shelf, perhaps, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the...
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that looks pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, upside down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you cleaned that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job on the 50s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good jobs on the 50s.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's just... Oh, the Hoss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Hoss.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Hoss is wicked fucking... I got some
90 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come over to the sunlight, and let's show
these people what we got going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need real light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so... Let's puff it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hits of Hoss.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some Hoss.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of got a little bit of a blue
thing going on with our white balance
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to... Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the 90 fresh frozen of watermelon
that we did on your birthday?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have a smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been saving it for you to come smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, let's check out that Hoss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the proper color.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were kind of stuck in Bluesville there
for a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got that 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the...
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number four of the draft.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the 90 micron right there of fresh
frozen watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're hitting right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to do a little torch mini?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to do a ruin rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you like?
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done a dab on the mini with
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had some people actually
commenting on some stuff last night on
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook, and they wanted to know if they
could dab on dry served or fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, if it's a full milk
quality, of course you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to show you those right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is happening as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full milk quality dab and such.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Puff Wednesday at your place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I like to sit and relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a beautiful view out the
window here, and I'm not going to have any
[SPEAKER_04]: cats outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put a little agua in the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agua.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say a little, it's like two
drops is all he's putting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite a great little pipe that we're
enjoying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the big torch underneath there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got to get the guys check out the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ever around in Barcelona,
look for this shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an amazing hemp store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp floors, hemp walls, the whole nine
yards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually were the ones that
hooked me up with this little piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also distributors and
wholesalers of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also have some medtainers.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I'm hitting that watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're definitely on the
medtainers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I gave them a few boxes while we were
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely it was us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this me?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll let you heat that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color is literally still white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is being off twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one hair already found its way in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the one hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that smokes full melt, anyone that
particularly takes macro photographs and
[SPEAKER_04]: really gets in there, you understand
quickly that it's incredible how easy it
[SPEAKER_04]: is for hair to contaminate and get in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to hit it right in the front
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Durian, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a full melt quality, you can see the
clear domes from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fave.
[SPEAKER_04]: My cat would like to say hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's decided to start meowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally it's Oreo, but today it's going
to be Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness is that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what the smell of that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was explaining to another guy yesterday
how the full melt quality is just so much
[SPEAKER_04]: more actually better for medicating and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a nice little interview with the
Vancouver Sun and we went all about
[SPEAKER_04]: Trichome, all hashes and how they're able
to actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to do the 90 first
because I was saving this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some D420K in the house as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran on a D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had quite a bit, so I managed to
hold on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of nice being able to be able to
puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's John that doesn't know how to
operate a torch because I never used one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, here, I'll light it up for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that people will say right
away, like don't do this, but do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they've also, well, they've been
giving me all sorts of tips on YouTube
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm not a big torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you got to be at this part
of the flame and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, okay, whatever makes it
red.
[SPEAKER_04]: The red fastest seems to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's nice is just the little tiny side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the right size, right side here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right side, right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice with the, it's not that easy for us
older guys hitting these 10 mil nails that
[SPEAKER_04]: are like super tiny and super close to our
faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close the eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our day is pretty unique today.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is our day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got going on for our day today,
John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we're going to cut some watermelon
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to produce more watermelon clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to mega ill.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to stop by green plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're going to do there is going
to be quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see very interesting puff
Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_04]: More to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep you, I'm going to keep
you watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to quite tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not telling yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see some pretty crazy
stuff today that only people like us do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit some gardener real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I guess we'll go hit breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with breakfast, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and we might even get that D-nail
going so when we come back it's sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: here ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hit the remote control as we come
in the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the D-nail ready and then we can
proceed on to our little surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: The surprise of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: What could Bubble Man and John B be up to?
[SPEAKER_03]: What could we be up to?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do some pretty crazy things on puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: But mostly what we do is everything is
legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing anything illegal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually showing you different
methods of medicating and different ways
[SPEAKER_04]: of dealing with a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And safety first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like turning off the torch is important so
you don't burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was impressed you knew how to turn it
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned how to turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the off button.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says lock on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me give that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this might be... That was some
hay-oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hay-oma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well with all the two of you guys,
you know this one is yours and that one is
[SPEAKER_04]: yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I brought these two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know I have these two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we seem to... I lost all mine
so... The question is mood at this point
[SPEAKER_04]: because all mine got lost and these ones
are brand new and I literally only got
[SPEAKER_04]: them yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the day before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I showed up with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: From my office.
[SPEAKER_04]: His store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like me to get some of your
skeleton tools from your office?
[SPEAKER_04]: Skeleton tools, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I always say it wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: You call them skeleton tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like tri-chrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you tri-chrome?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm combing my hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tri-chrome, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Darren who said tri-chrome
and you said tri-chrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're back on your own comb now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can watch the old videos actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to heat that up for me as I get
my trophy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will torch your man for you,
Sir John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, what can you guys do on your
Puff Wednesdays?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we like to hear those comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean everybody's got their own thing and
we've started up, you know, that we've got
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like our Puff Wednesdays because it
gives us a time to enjoy and get together
[SPEAKER_04]: and well actually we get together more
than on Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be Wednesday, Friday,
Saturday, Monday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually got my cot in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the hammock up the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might see that, the new hammock
that... Let's see if we can give you this
[SPEAKER_04]: one real quick because it's not hot
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I should do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't hit it right in the right
spot when it's not... Yeah, perfect.
Perfecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: The torch just weans out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to head down to,
I guess, the Best Western for some
[SPEAKER_04]: breakfast because we're starving.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back and cut some toast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some clones and we'll see you guys here in
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the guy that's scratching so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Morpheus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to rip the trippy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously I'm going to do five turnovers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important that you always have
the trippy on first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I hear you, mumbler?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said you really got to make sure the
trippy's on first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet, sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, after breakfast, it's always
nice to have a nice little rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you want to head back to your place?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time to get back to the
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on our way out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess that was a great breakfast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in John's neighborhood here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where to, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, see you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be in his basement set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to his giant TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: License for sending.
[SPEAKER_04]: License for sending.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually doing a transport and this is
the exciting part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada Interact Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shatney, this is the whole license and
everything that we're sending that goes
[SPEAKER_04]: along with Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the approval, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's print that off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking for approvals in order to
transfer my strain to a licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the future, we'll be able to get
actually my strain Medi-Cush that works so
[SPEAKER_04]: well for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when, you know, God forbid,
if there's ever a time that I can't grow
[SPEAKER_04]: my medicine, at least I'll be able to
access my strain and I will never lose my
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now I am proceeding with sending
my strain to an LP so they can grow
[SPEAKER_04]: standardized Medi-Cush for medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be using my feeding program,
hang, dry, you know, apparently organic
[SPEAKER_04]: garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and that's all in contracts with
lawyers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't try and take away what I do
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's just a good way to preserve
your genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important to me because I
really so need these genetics for my pain
[SPEAKER_04]: control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with this whole system, it's really
scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I want to make sure like that
the genetics that I've worked so hard on
[SPEAKER_04]: are able to be able to access for the rest
of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is this is me doing this right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been going on now for about three
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot of work and a lot of
patients with letters back and forth to
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada and these people and getting
all the confirmation, which I have today
[SPEAKER_04]: to put it on a cargo plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wicked, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get this thing printed off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's go blaze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to blaze.
All
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got all the proper stuff and
everything to be signed off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And March 27th was the day that things
were printed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is this is quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that I know no one else
has done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what strains other than Medi Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the other strains are you know,
they're this is what works for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what people have been sought
after.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, because the strains work so
well, and we've done testing results on it
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years, working with Dr. Polanyi
and finding all the ecstasies on how
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis has affected me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the strain that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is the strain that we want to
get to patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just says here it's authorized manager
of license permission office of substance
[SPEAKER_04]: control act on behalf of the minister on
March 27, then I'm able to transfer my
[SPEAKER_04]: plants from my place here to my numbers
are all here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything is in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just going to put an envelope and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if cops come, well, I guess we
got the paperwork, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I can't wait to go ship some plants
with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, I was going to check on
some live plants back here in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got there, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got all the pucks here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put some water in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We figured it'd just be easier to come
inside and work with the tap here and then
[SPEAKER_04]: show you how we actually put water in our
little tube so we can transport some home
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course, you want to have a
couple of cuts of your strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd love to bring the Astro Boy home
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, these are the plants
that you have in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were the same from the eight cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, since a 12 cuts that were rooted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I flipped eight of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we saw four of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen four more of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already did fresh frozen on your
birthday with four of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've got those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the last two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are our main mums.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today, we're going to take some cuts
from this watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, I would say to just start with
a little bit of warm water because it just
[SPEAKER_04]: works out really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you know, you got to kind
of let it heat up a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just goes quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: To make it warm, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you make it warm, it's a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've got our pucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's going to pour the hot water on the
top of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will warm water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see them getting bigger already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just takes seconds this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get lots of that's just how I
like to do my things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quicker and easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll let them cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to jam fresh cut clones
into the steaming water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that was nice and quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those pucks all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this and then I'll put it into the
dome, which I normally do outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a lot nicer to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the same time, I can just kind
of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that water is certainly not that
warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks it's steaming on the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really makes the water look much
warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so next up some clone cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't hurt to put on some gloves,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little clonage on the watermelons,
eh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So me personally, I was going to get you
your tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just stepped on one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cracker Dacker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cracker Dacker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to move our camera angle a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll start with you taking a few,
and I'll show them up close what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right here is I'm just going to reach
in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to peel it right off the
stalk here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This little pinch, and it peels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to cut it right off the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little bit hard to see,
but perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I have is I have this perfect
little tap root right in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always like to just kind of shave it
off a little bit so it's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, well, for now,
we're going to put it into these tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: No gel at all, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not right now, because actually
we're going to send this home with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to use that rooting
gel that you brought in there from Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I learned how to cut
clones, no matter what, whenever I cut the
[SPEAKER_04]: clone, in fact, one of the most successful
cloners that ever showed me this trick
[SPEAKER_04]: used to take thousands of clones a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he used scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he cut them super fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he dipped his scissors in rooting gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what he said was when he cut the
clone, instead of oxygen accessing the
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh breach, it's gelled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not using the gel at first to get
roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using it to seal it instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even as I watched you take that and
hold it in the air, I'm sure these plants
[SPEAKER_04]: are so hardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably put that clone in the
fridge the way it is for two or three
[SPEAKER_04]: months, and it would still bloody grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen in plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen clones like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really looks nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look how happy you look, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's because I take pride in doing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a high five stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is my little love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sterile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take good care of what I do and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work on doing things properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're doing it pretty damn
good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep working away here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you cut a few more?
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy out of the way so we can kind of
see what you're doing this time around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You coming in on this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just peel it right off of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how I do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what's most important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get 100% success rate on my rooting all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing something right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if it ain't broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always a different way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what works for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was shown by an old friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he gets 100% success rate,
too.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill her up like that so we know we got
her in good standing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And put the lid on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got another little clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got a nice little clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, normally what I would do me
personally is I get a little black felt
[SPEAKER_04]: pen and I'm right on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because normally when I take clones,
I take about six or seven different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I always do like four,
four, and four.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're keeping it right in our
mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at this beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come in and cut this because
I'm going to show you what I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: here because we're going to see this keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to come in and I'm just going
to cut this straight off here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to continue growing
perfectly for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to leave this for you so you can
cut it on a 45 or at least I always cut
[SPEAKER_06]: just below there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that rooting gel, if I had that,
that would work really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going right into water right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you say, it seals it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something that I'm definitely
going to try next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get to cutting a few clones
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put the camera down.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want me to go just into the cup
for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put them on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to take them outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I have the cup here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead, we're going to go right into
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we don't have, do you have that
kind of Remo's rooting gel that you wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: to try?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remo's Roots Cloning Gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Remo gave this to me just a few days
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sorry, a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has not been opened yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the gooey blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the gooey blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably enough right on the lid there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is perfect, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, what I always like to do is I
always like to squish them out a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit so they're not so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: I barely squeezed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're freaking me out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to do that to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did it just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just enough so they're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too wet, but wet enough that I don't have
to actually go in and add water to these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once I put these in the dome
outside, which we're going to go do that
[SPEAKER_04]: once we're finished here, you're going to
see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to get right in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make some more cuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to do my tried and true
method.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to wait for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school gel coated scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're doing is you're just sealing
the cut with gel pretty much as you make
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice one right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave one growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a peel, but he was doing that from
underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I kind of already did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You already did that method, which is kind
of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it's something that's new,
something that I haven't done before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really nice working with with you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're doing it up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we go in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's not too nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go in one that's actually open.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times what I didn't do is
normally I put the little scissor in the
[SPEAKER_04]: top there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this one I think you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's nice and open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one I tried is quite open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to cut those
bottom leaves off there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to cut that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put them right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to take about how many?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to do one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do four per light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do two lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take eight nice cones.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cezos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cezos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take one a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little big on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a little big, but hey,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go for a nice little hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that little one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the peeler guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got the peel going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the peel going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's what works really well
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been doing for years and
I'm not trying to grow great big mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So me peeling, it helps me to get some
nice little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like little baby ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure they move very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, a couple of nice ones are
never going to be a problem either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to have those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to be cutting clones and working with
you today, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of something we've never done
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always trying to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is the best way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how I do mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got different methods and
everybody's got different techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just cut it like right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking so as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strip that bottom leaf off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go like that and like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dipping it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's already been dipped once before
because he's decided to put the root of
[SPEAKER_04]: all the scissors, which I think is a great
idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would usually use, OK,
I'll be honest, a much cleaner pair of
[SPEAKER_04]: scissors, not scissors that have been used
for trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would use a brand new pair of clean
scissors, dip it in rooting gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably would have cleaned it each
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already contaminated this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to wipe this clean before we
put it on top there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are normally how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just realized that when I grab the
scissors, they weren't looking all that
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still going to do the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put them in the gel for one
quick sec.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure out that leafy and that leafy with
the dip in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just needs to be working in the jardin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working in the jardin and making clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more for the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have five, six, seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to do two lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're definitely going to be hashing
this in about three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, paper towel right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just give this a wipe because it did
get a little contaminated from the dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to rather keep that nice
and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, another new product from Remo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know John's used it once already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's always nice to support our
buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remo grows dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not completely out of this world
for me to think that he would be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: design a product that properly cloned
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've just taken about 10 nice
watermelon cuts, small ones to big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest ones really only having a few
growth sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smaller ones just being also one
or two growth sites, but a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: shorter in stature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's hard to see too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need like one, two, three, four,
five, six, two, two, four, six,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need an eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why I like the eight is, like I said
before, is being a dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with me, I'm going to just shave the
side of this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got little techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did do the scissor dip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just all these new techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I love the idea of the gel seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sealing the cut as you make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing this for years, growing my own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time you bring someone new in,
you go, hey, that's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be doing that from now on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I did have dirty scissors,
and they were dirty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dirty with hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least John's dirt is pure resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shall we dome these up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take these outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take these outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to mark and label these?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're already marked and labeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: In what way?
[SPEAKER_04]: In what way?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put them close to this edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you got your methods?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very a big, strict guy on marking my
labels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the watermelon is so unique that
you'd never mistake it for anything once
[SPEAKER_04]: it bloomed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you have in there again?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got Tahoe and Medi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Medi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be the horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always got to do the horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the dome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you spray water in your dome?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do on the third day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been on that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put these little ladies down
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Tahoe, and she's rooted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that sticking straight up just
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd you get that from?
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually came from, this is a DNA
strain, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came from Manitoba from a friend named
Jason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many Tahoe's you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: One.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you better figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be putting that into definitely
dirt, like these other ones that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: rooting around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see as I only cut certain
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they root, I start putting them
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to put this dome back on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dome it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have my thing already numbered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of know that these first three rows
and those rows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, I've done this quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do I know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got the threes done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already know on the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now today, it just became water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already know what these are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very easy for me to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't really like to put too
much on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of works out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you had a chance to see the
watermelon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go take a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I normally do because we've got
blue light now, I'm going to turn a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of these off so we can actually see in
there right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is my garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm going to do right now is I'm
just going to shut down a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: noise for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the many there, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can see the watermelon in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's four over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just showing them the first plant I saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely my medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does she look?
[SPEAKER_05]: Resonance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hearing those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: She looks very Resonance, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see we've got several different
strains in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these Medi Kushes as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that there would be the, that's the
Dennis Hawker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the look on this little guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice bush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: See I got four on these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani style, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: That there is the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the different types that I
have in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the one in the back there is more the
solid four.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the three little sisters I talked
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's fresh frozen in the freezer
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right beside you is the watermelon
looking thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got you in my garden here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to give you a quick look at
how I got four plants per light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I rubbed four different strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my MKU.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my Dennis Hawker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my Bubba Chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all my different strains in here,
which is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see all the different phenotypes
and everything's just going to sleep right
[SPEAKER_04]: now because it's time for the lights to go
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can just see it's, you know,
how I got everything set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my, I had a leak in the roof,
so I had to cut down the blue skin and fix
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise than that, yeah,
this is my sealed research room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you get it done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's designed for my perfection.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: This stool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now you can see how I work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody always says I should fill my
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, for me being injured,
I can work on my plants at this height.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why you always see this height
in my room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can work in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can pick it up and take a good look.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comfortable for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exactly how I do my medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I love so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can just trust it all out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And out we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say good night to that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what she just did.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, ladies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, they're both staring at the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not running for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here he comes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to bring him in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up she comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these just came from outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally John would never have these
in his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because he has right now permission
from Health Canada to ship these off,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously it's OK if we put them in here
for five minutes and get ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lot easier to actually do this
inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as you can see in how everything
is set up, it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is their new home for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the new home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the new home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the new home.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go in at an angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm going to do first, actually,
is I'm going to wrap the top so the dirt
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't spread out if anything happens,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just give it a little circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would like to do, I just want to
ensure a few things here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to wrap the top of my plant
just like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it's a two-man team here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shrimp wrapping the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might as well go professional and let that
last one get right over top there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a whole idea here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to ensure we're going to tape
this up and we're going to do a really
[SPEAKER_06]: good job here for each one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Large saran wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, these are smelling so beautiful too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, because normally they're outside and
the smell in here is quite phenomenal when
[SPEAKER_04]: it comes to a live plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're pushing that stalker quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now check this out, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick wrap around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drop this in this tube and how we're going
to transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Transport, not transplant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got it going at an angle there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it an angle here.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we going to do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: In she goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we cap her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to cap her out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cap her out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be very much what you want to do
with the bottom as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do the same with the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should cap the bottoms as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cap the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same way, upside down like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can wrap them very nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll only push up a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now that we've capped the top,
we're going to use a machine and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to wrap the tops of all of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, over at...
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be on a clear thing over at
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have access to the machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to have it wrapped.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, this is how we're going to be
transporting to our new license facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get this camera on a tripod and we'll
get these last four plants done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So new method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was me holding the camera and
watching John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to help John out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're able to start... And what we're
looking at is we just want to have the
[SPEAKER_04]: tops of them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not letting the dirt fly all over the
plant while it's inside the... While it's
[SPEAKER_04]: inside the chimney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was much easier to do with your
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now watch this is even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing now is we're going to
stick this in like this and pop this in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess some of these are a little
tighter than the other ones.
Oh, you got it.
Very good.
Very good.
Look at this guy.
He's crushing it.
Literally.
Literally crushing it.
Oh, you're going to get crushed.
That's good.
It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it on a nice angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now she's slowing it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another base here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be quite as violent
with this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to gently fold this
top over because it's just right in the
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we fold it gently, we'll be
less likely to crush it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're definitely getting our air
tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean... That's pretty good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's slide this one back over here with
the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get some of this bottom stuff
just out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a little dead leaf right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're professionals.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that first little initial stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you've got the glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to seal this top up real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is looking great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we've done this before.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been doing this for minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 minutes now, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to cut it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cut it quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Capping it top and bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you cap that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get this many crush ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this one fits a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess some of these tubes are just
getting a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fold that head down again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's going to need a bit of
head push cut down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one just fits nicely on there,
eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's much nicer than that last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: They always have one tight one there,
which is, well, you know, they are just
[SPEAKER_04]: tubes, so nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got three done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we switched sides now.
[SPEAKER_04]: John, I like to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to do this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fold it on this side.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this way, I'm going to pass it over to
you like I did last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once this stuff sticks to itself,
it's a done deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a done deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got one more good triangle to go
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we perfect?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just tear it off like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're professionals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want the base?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got your two, one and two.
[SPEAKER_04]: One for the bottom, one for the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that one there's a crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that one does have a crack,
but maybe it'll be the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe duct tape it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the funny angle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't go in at the perfect angle,
like this one got pushed down so low that
[SPEAKER_04]: it makes it a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to push too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're kind of going a little overboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of hurting myself now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just give it a good... There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more even than the floor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the lippy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down she goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nice when she slides in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this cracked one might come in
handy here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we're going to have to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have that one sealed up like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can deal with it later if we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have only one more of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we happen to have one more downstairs,
so we'll get that at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap this last one up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working up a bit of a sweat because
for me this is actually... Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll sneak that up in a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last one and we're medicating because,
Cory, do I need to medicate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, I thought I had my trippy on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be... Soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicating soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turn is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even have to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just move this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to start cutting right
across.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way across.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you might need two more of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more.
Perfect.
How's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to do that on this room?
[SPEAKER_06]: This room?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's huge compared to the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll put the last top on from
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to load these onto the pallet,
get it into the back of the truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, John and I are having a
session right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was good work, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Puff Wednesday, surrounded by mother
plants and these cool tubes that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: about to take to the Vancouver
International Airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a session, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just laughed when you said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about we're going to take these...
You puff my hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to... Here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to puff my hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got skillet tools, torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, DK420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always thanks to DK420 just for fucking
being, A, a stand-up fucking guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also being a pretty big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an imposing guy, yet he's such a
kind-hearted person and so willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: share his information that we're happy to
call him one of our crew, that he's one of
[SPEAKER_04]: our good friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a part of the Resin Team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the general, the dry-sift general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the nickname that I gave him that
he likes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and as I just... I'm waiting for you
to hit that, but as you can see,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to work off and see how
that's just melting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: D420K?
[SPEAKER_04]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was made by D420K and... See,
that's just a great thing, and I think his
[SPEAKER_04]: is nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you hitting there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to... Right into the 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just awesome, because that's where
I'd be going right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wish you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so anytime you're ready,
I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace, everybody!
Talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: some different pipes that we just hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we have hit more polar opposite
pipes right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you've got the treating
yourself... What was this?
[SPEAKER_04]: The first prize winner?
[SPEAKER_04]: First prize winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: First prize winner for Mehdi Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mehdi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Mehdi Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a couple years ago with the
treating yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got this classic ruler with the full
crown.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got the 14 millimeter, which is also
the smaller little sister.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even cooler, he's got the original
bent bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you guys this, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a bowl that myself, trichome
farmer... There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the original bent bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a very good design, now that I look
back upon it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit too open here,
but this was one of the better ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 18-8s were the first ones we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we came up with this design at my
booth at the Canada Trade in Bern,
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland in like 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember trichome farmers was with
me, and Mark McCoy from Vriptac,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Ashan Shaheen from Vapir.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we came up with this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't very many years later that
Adam Dunn from Ham Puglum and THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: he was like, why don't you just bend the
stem?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which really was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made so much more sense than bending
the bowl, because if you bend the stem,
[SPEAKER_04]: you suddenly make every angled bowl a flat
bowl, which is why we want that bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bubble bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for watching hash melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original bowl that comes with this
bong is just a straight bowl, and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: purely for herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's downstairs in my display case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever use it, because I've never
smoked herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I did when I won my cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stuffed it full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is this now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be the, the bottom would be
the 45 of watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smell between, say the 45 and the
smell of the 73, like I always talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the 45 is more oily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that oily, funky, oh wow,
this is the 73?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, this is the 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that, which is
completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta hit that next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's like white.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your birthday hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought the clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're taking them home.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a cool full circle that John and I
are constantly rocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember back in the day that helicopter
might've made us nervous?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on our way to the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember back in the day where we wouldn't
have been filming all of this before we
[SPEAKER_04]: did this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we ever did this before without
licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to this about Jason there when I
was over at his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did a video and he had my tattoo in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made him tear down the video on YouTube
because my tattoo was in the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I did not want anybody to know what
I was doing, but I was conducting
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the guy on global national news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're educating now.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pain for us is just me in everyday life as
an educating one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working in the trenches, I would say you
more than me in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your stories go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing what you've accomplished over
the years in this industry and the people
[SPEAKER_04]: you've met.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long, strange trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long stage trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to keep diving here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You inspired me to say, hey, you got to
hit that 73.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch it melt off the skeletal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just drips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice bubble, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those clear domes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my turn to hit this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, knowing I just took a little too
much, I'm going to put some back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to bring the hit man to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This and the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot be without the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jamaica is still all up in the air,
but I've got to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott's been asking me for dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony's been asking me for dates.
[SPEAKER_05]: John's been asking me for dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to book these tickets in the next
day or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to figure out the whole game
plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your family vacation that
you're going to be going into.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sooner the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to end up loading
these plans up onto my truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to head down to the place
where we're going to be wrapping them on
[SPEAKER_04]: the pallet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there, I guess we're going to
just take our time, make our way to the
[SPEAKER_04]: airport, and we're going to hit mega ill
after we drop these bad boys off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then we're going to have
definitely an appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, by then we'll have an appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still pretty full from breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was actually a really nice
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, more rips, and Puff Wednesday,
we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this was the way we managed to
get these into these trays.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're laying nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had them standing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're going to tape the lids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on to each tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Securing that lid, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Securing the lid.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so getting the lid secured.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already got the base secured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple taping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just getting these ready for
the job that is soon to follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matty Kush, coming to a licensed
production facility near you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, five plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting them on the pallet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You securing the pallet there,
John?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm securing the pallet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Making sure everything fits here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all nice and secure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, do a quick cardboard wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: She fits all these nice kinds of gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Giving her a quick wrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I will for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be able to stay in touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for your help.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's two types of cannabis
growers, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know what types there are?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those that require forklifts and those
that don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I require forklift now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it secure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we got those plants loaded up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make our way to the airport.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here we are just moving some
cannabis plants through the local
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just noticed the RCMP driving by there and
obviously they don't have any issue with
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, two weeks in a book and 26.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a room that you also write
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cargo.
All
[SPEAKER_04]: right, Miller Road.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, heading over to the big
building, the Air Canada building.
[SPEAKER_05]: Found our way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Air Canada parking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just got here and we're laughing
because it's just about 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect time, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here at the Air Canada cargo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just going to, you know,
nothing really to just this is where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going and everything should be on file.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the number and then everything's
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, this should be a five minute
or five minute or probably 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from the distance, you'd never know
what was in that truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your documents, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're just going to give that a quick
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, they give it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tell us the weight and then we go
back with the weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's what he said to do.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there she goes on the forklift.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now she gets measured for the exact
space that she takes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Video for them to see once this is all
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know it's a nice little,
a little documentation and we showed
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves packaging everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll open everything up the same
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sitting on the scale right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm standing on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's standing on it, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they get the extra money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget about the thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty four kilos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty four kilos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, considering, I mean, geez,
most of it's the the wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think pretty much now we're heading to
Megahill and we're going to have some
[SPEAKER_05]: pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have pizza.
We're going to have pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have pizza.
We're going to have pizza.
