[SPEAKER_05]: The Hash Church episode, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: 19?
[SPEAKER_05]: 19, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash Church 3.0 got Etienne Fontaine and
Mr. Skunkman Sam in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good, good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to create the link, copy the link
for the new chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got to post it into the old
chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you know what else you have to
do, actually?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I don't post something in the chat,
it actually just sits there with nobody
[SPEAKER_05]: able to type.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that for about 20 minutes last week,
so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever seen a variety that was
extremely high in CBD, like 20,
[SPEAKER_07]: 25%, which had less than 0.3% THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm aware of, unless there was a
hemp varietal I was working with back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where was that question coming from,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what genetic is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's just that there are people who
claim they have varieties which are 20,
[SPEAKER_07]: 25% or even higher of CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say it has zero or really a tiny
amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the trouble is that even if there's
not a THC synthase making THC for the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, the CBD synthase produces about a
20 to 25 to one ratio of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if there's zero THC synthase,
CBD synthase makes some THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at 25%, that would be equal to about
1% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's biologically impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I still?
[SPEAKER_07]: Either I was frozen or you were frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying it was biologically
impossible?
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I know, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Duly noted, and I will keep an eye out for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people who are watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty clever with this stuff,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would say you, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else would be a little skeptical,
but you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the master geneticist of master
geneticists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just liking how clear his voice is
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all like loud and clear and it's in
my ears good.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last couple of weeks, Sam's been in a
tube, like at a distance from his
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you sound great today, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess we better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea why, because it's
definitely the same old me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, welcome to Johnny B and Colin and
Wade, Skunkman Sam and Etienne myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the old schoolers in Hash Church
today, doing it up on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B, I couldn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I had to learn how to shave again
this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude, I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ow, ow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Always willing to share his failures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny, remember, you're supposed to wash
it in hot water and it shrinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got this new really cool razor and I put
it all together.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ow, ow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny, we love you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm going to hit some of my Hank.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Hank it up with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, yeah, I've been seeing you post,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I'm so proud of you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I just want to reach in through
the photo and give you a hug, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also, you know, like, look,
this this isn't this isn't six star hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't me being done.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't even under my own brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is under a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hank, that we created for a mid grade
brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, mid grade is almost 70 percent THC
in this particular hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes it mid grade to me is the
terpene content is not high enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love a 10 to 12 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like around four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also been kept cold, but I left it
overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's got that nice Afghan flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes out of the fridge,
you know, four percent terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not going to smell much because
everything's kind of slimy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so slow down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does bubble and melt and my banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't put it past a four star
personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a perspective of Bubble Man,
the connoisseur, of course I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: release six plus star bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from the perspective of the amount of
sheer work and and obstacles and burning
[SPEAKER_05]: hoops that I had to jump through just to
make this available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I'm so spoiled when it
comes to hash that I'm sure 90% of people
[SPEAKER_05]: are gonna be like, dude, this is some of
the nicest hash in the market right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me as a person, I'm like,
we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been, already since this released,
I've already been in touch with some craft
[SPEAKER_05]: growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna look at doing some fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just gonna try and, oh,
it does have a nice smell though,
[SPEAKER_05]: as it's open under my nose, that old
school, just Afghani kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Johnny B ended up going and
getting one as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna hit some in my banger right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got three coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it, I went away on Friday at one o
'clock and came back at two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I got back, there was a card in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went to the shopper's yesterday to
try and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, yeah, I know you got to come
back Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Monday morning at 11 a.m., I'm gonna go
and pick up your hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one gram to squish, one gram to
smoke, and one gram to put away,
[SPEAKER_08]: because that's just me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I bought one from cannabis,
BC cannabis stores, because I wanted one
[SPEAKER_05]: right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's not getting here until
the ninth or the 10th of March.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I went to Up and Smoke,
which is owned by Dom and Max.
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to own Sunrise Wellness
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They changed their name to Up and Smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you check them out on Instagram,
Up and Smoke 604, they got their Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: account busted so many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're just meme dealers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just have funny memes up on that
page.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot of it's just busting LPs
balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet they're totally in support.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny to meet people in the
industry who are, you know, come from this
[SPEAKER_05]: super high level and they want to get this
thing to a certain level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you are forced to retake all the steps
to get to that level.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't just get to jump into the legal
realm and then hope that everyone's
[SPEAKER_05]: growing cannabis that's good enough and
all this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're pretty excited to be in the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty stoked to have Hank in the
marketplace, a high THC and a mid THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I really did was I just broke up the
microns.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put my 73, my 90, my 120 and my 45 into
this, which is called a high THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put the 190, the 160 and the 25 into
the mid grade, all of them being gold and
[SPEAKER_05]: hash, none of them being full of
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all came out pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's why there's a massive sort of
price difference in between.
[SPEAKER_05]: The two grades, whereas the THC difference
doesn't seem as massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these are more things I was
forced into.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I have loved to have released a 90
micron?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would this have gone from a four star to
maybe a five star?
[SPEAKER_05]: Had I isolated the microns and sold them
separately?
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite possibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 90 probably would have been
there, but then I have to pay a $1,500 COA
[SPEAKER_05]: for every single micron that I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, $1,500 COA with full, you know,
microbials with turbo beans, with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids, with fungicides and
pesticides, very expensive, but forced to
[SPEAKER_05]: do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also take out like 10 plus grams of
the product to sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: send that off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as cheap as we would like it to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's minor things where we're forced
and then there's, you know, as best that
[SPEAKER_05]: we can do, we kind of try to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all in all, pretty stoked to have a
little Hank bubble rip with the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: churches.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's here in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to mute my mic and torch my
bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcus, the amount you have to send off,
you said 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that whether it's weed or hash or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because with weed, you know, that's only,
you know, a little bit of THC actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas with hash, that's a whole lot of
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying our best to kind of get,
you know, the regulatory framework lined
[SPEAKER_05]: up with the QA people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they realize, look, like 10 grams of
hash is a lot more than 10 grams of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to identify those differences
big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also something we keep,
we have to retain samples as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like 20 to 30 grams that go in
the vault and sit there basically forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, they take your margin
and they just do this to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 20 grams that you put in the
vault, is that frozen or refrigerated or
[SPEAKER_07]: otherwise it's going to change a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we keep it as cold as we possibly
can, but these are things that we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: noticing as well, that the regulatory
framework doesn't have a deep
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like we're going to be
testing it all the time, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: they keep it for retention in case
anything ever goes wrong, in case they
[SPEAKER_05]: ever find something that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that lot, we need to be able to go
into the vault and pull that out and go
[SPEAKER_05]: through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remove the oxygen and freeze it at
like minus 30 centigrade, then it does not
[SPEAKER_07]: change really hardly at all in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the exact same thing from my own
freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jeremy spoke about that last week
as well, in regards to using potential
[SPEAKER_05]: noble gases to, well, removing the oxygen
and then replacing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Replacing with argon, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a variety of noble gases that you
can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you speak toward, Marcus,
is a reality I think a lot of us are
[SPEAKER_04]: facing is we're finding these regulatory
loopholes that we're forced to deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're in the over-regulated
commodities of the reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, $1,500 per COA.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Jesus, that is just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Per micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Per micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just absolutely ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why I'm forced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how hard it was for me to put
the microns together?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, we need only two grades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, whoa, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, we need two grades.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, listen, I can't do two grades.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be three.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to take the 220 out and keep that
as like, you know, and then of course they
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted me to just destroy the 220,
which came out at 48% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, I'm not destroying the
220.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we need to do is create some SOPs and
some PCPs that allow us to take the
[SPEAKER_05]: material once it's been worked,
put it back into the vault.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can send it over to Mike West on the
other side and have him do, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2 or hydrocarbon or one of the solvent
extractions on that because holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine like 49% yields when you
run your material versus like 10 to 15 or
[SPEAKER_05]: three to five?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like some of these hemp guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that extractors are doing
is when they don't have enough of any
[SPEAKER_07]: given product, whether it's flowers or
water sift or whatever, they mix it,
[SPEAKER_07]: then squash it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all just one homogenous mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can get one single COA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man, is there an appeal process or
a process of education?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make them aware that they will
actually take hold or they're just,
[SPEAKER_04]: the system is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the system is like all systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always had to educate the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is what all of us have been
doing for 25 to 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the system requires self
education.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we will do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you've climbed up to the almost
peak of the mountain and then you kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: fall off the end and realize, oh,
like, okay, we're in this regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: framework now, but I'm not where I want it
to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down here now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a massive appeal that needs to
be made and not just in education.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the knowledge needs to go not
just from the government folks,
[SPEAKER_05]: but into the people who own the companies,
into the understanding of living soils and
[SPEAKER_05]: regenerative farming practices and living
biomes that produce those precursors that
[SPEAKER_05]: express the terpenes to the point that we
actually want them at to get to a system
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not only representative of THC
percentage, but actually gets into some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the other components of the plants to be
able to allow people and not handcuff them
[SPEAKER_05]: into being able to succeed in this
industry rather than fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now people are up against a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulatory framework is absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not complaining about the
framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just mildly bummed out that for the
last 25 to 30 years, we spent all this
[SPEAKER_05]: time sort of preaching to the choir and
now the choir has gotten off the stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doors have opened at the back and now
we have all of society actually listening,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're listening back down at this
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not coming in up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to come back down to a reasonable
level and hold all these hands that we
[SPEAKER_05]: basically begged to be a part of this and
to come into this with open arms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have to very patiently be like,
okay, well, look, this can't be like this
[SPEAKER_05]: because this is hindering the ability to
grow living soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this can't be like this because the
excess of packaging and testing is keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: certain products from the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this can't be like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're not evil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not like out to get us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spoken with quite a few of these
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just people that literally were in
the wine industry two and a half years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're in the cannabis industry,
feeling like they want to do the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what it is, Marcus,
that they want to err on the side of
[SPEAKER_07]: safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to take a long while to drag
them to see what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 20 grams of 80% THC hash is not the
same as 20 grams of 20% weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's just reality and we know
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone said, you are complaining
about the framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly some of the framework I'm
complaining about, we need to fix that as
[SPEAKER_05]: we always have.
[SPEAKER_05]: We fought and practiced civil disobedience
to levels of such excessiveness to get the
[SPEAKER_05]: framework that we have now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're certainly not going to just
stop and stick with what we have now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be bettered.
[SPEAKER_05]: But within the framework itself,
you also have people who think they're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to grow amazing cannabis with shitty
techniques and without the awareness and
[SPEAKER_05]: the compassion and the love that really is
required.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's education that needs to go
there that has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all sorts of people coming in to
commoditize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that happens the
right way and doesn't happen the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's complaints to be had
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all in all, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm absolutely beyond elated that I'm
finally, after 30 years of being involved
[SPEAKER_05]: with this plant, after 21 years of
teaching people how to make hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: super proud of my team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Prashan and to Abby and to
Randy and to Jazz, the frontliners that
[SPEAKER_05]: made this hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made this hash more than I made this
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the lab and I was training them
and overwatching them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm really, really proud of those guys
and proud of our whole QA team and proud
[SPEAKER_05]: of our finance team.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll shut up, but I needed to give them
all props to the whole team at Embark.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot express how difficult this was to
do and how many amazing people had to work
[SPEAKER_05]: 24-7 in congruence, in synergy to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to my team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go celebrate with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Celebrate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes many hands to do the lifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But things like this, you have to
celebrate because these are game-changing
[SPEAKER_04]: events in lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a Herculean lift you've
actually posted over your heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's only going to get better every
time you go up a notch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And till finally, you're able to produce
the absolute finest in large quantities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks to you, Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had I not met you, had you not allowed me
into your life and trusted me,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude, thank you so much for trusting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because your trust that you put in me is
one of the huge reasons why I am here
[SPEAKER_05]: where I am today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never have a problem giving you the
props for that because holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot be happier to say that what I
want to see is everybody able to smoke the
[SPEAKER_07]: equivalent of 99.9%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's water hash, whether it's
rosin, how it's made is not as important
[SPEAKER_07]: as that it's clean, safe and suitable for
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, did you ever think you would see this
in your lifetime?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised it took so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Under Carter, we thought we were going to
get this, you know, move towards it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He promised decriminalization and then the
whole born set up where the drugs are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he wasn't a drug czar.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a drug advisor or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he got popped and everything,
everything went skewy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we honestly expected at 76,
we would have full federal
[SPEAKER_07]: decriminalization or even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it hadn't been for Keith Straub,
it probably could have happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, unfortunately, he thought
he was doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was not the right thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it set us back a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who don't know, Keith Straub was
the head of normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normal was actually started with a
$200,000 donation from Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so needless to say, he was a huge
supporter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at an event, apparently, Keith Straub
did lines of coke with the actual drug
[SPEAKER_04]: advisor.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the president and basically came out
and went straight to the media and said,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, it's time to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just did lines of coke with the,
you know, the drug advisor here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was really annoyed because of the whole
Paraquat thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the tipping point in his
mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they could spray poison on our
cannabis, then why the fuck are we
[SPEAKER_07]: protecting them if they're going to be
taking drugs, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snitching just ain't a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were killing people,
and that's why they were upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paraquat was killing and harming people
because of the government's jealousy to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, continue its prohibition
policies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they started spraying poison on
cannabis, and it started affecting
[SPEAKER_04]: people's lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand the anger, however,
as well as the wanting to change it and
[SPEAKER_04]: the vitriol going along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, Keith's decision ended up,
you know, costing us decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keith's feelings were correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: His actions were not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly am not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you opened up your mouth at hand,
those are not the words I thought you were
[SPEAKER_05]: going to say about Keith Straub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I got no problem being not nice to
people who weren't kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know he worked hard and he has
tried to right the wrong that he did.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's done a lot for cannabis, but he he
also put one of the biggest foot in the
[SPEAKER_07]: mouth of the I don't even know what to
say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Carter had all but promised.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it just completely fell to dust.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look, Willie smoked on top of the
roof of the White House, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, this is why we've had to
continue to fight is because of the fear
[SPEAKER_04]: and the ignorance and the perpetuation of
this drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, drug warriors meant their
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we screwed up and we fucked
up along the way to the point where we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had to continue to fix things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still dealing with the fallout
and the picking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still not there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've done it in the 10th
Amendment, you know, states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nationally, you know, we're working on
myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to federal beyond
decriminalization to legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where interstate commerce is allowed to
happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: International commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want OK, but let's start with interstate
and then move on to I mean, Canada's right
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure Canada would love for us to
grow the weed for Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Said no, no Canadian ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we used to grow quite a bit for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, we don't mind it going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And forth, let's keep it synergistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be in Hawaii and people would
bring me B.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bud and say, yeah, man, this is to Maui
Waui.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know why they had a Jamaican
accent in Hawaii and they had the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_07]: state everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: The herb is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a perfect segue into rest in
peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Livingston, the final third,
the last story, Mr. Bunny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Bunny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my goodness, I don't know of any of
you that actually know the whole story,
[SPEAKER_05]: but his wife went missing a while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just wandered off and nobody has been
able to find her for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Bunny just recently passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was lucky enough to see Bunny many,
many times in concert, was lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_05]: puff with him and meet him and be at his
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was a super tripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the last of the living whalers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I suspect that Peter and Bob and Bunny
are, you know, in Zion right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: just enjoying, enjoying the good herbs,
enjoying the good music.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only imagine the music that is being
produced in the afterlife.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pretty week before that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was you, Roy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was you, Roy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace to you, Roy, as well as you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Roy used to come to Amsterdam and we would
get together at his hotel and smoke skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, he was a really down to earth,
nice guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, isn't it you, Roy, that hooked you
up with like culture and all those guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I connected with a bunch of them
here in Amsterdam because, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very free with my herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you love reggae music.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was another thing that I always knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you showed me a reggae collection,
I was like, this is all OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he wasn't a brother from another mother
before this, he just opens up these two
[SPEAKER_05]: drawers under his television and they're
just like full of CDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's like, oh, and I've got these
recordings from the last 25 years at the
[SPEAKER_05]: Milky Way, like every reggae show that was
like at the Paradiso or the Milk Vague.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember which one it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recorded them on DAT digital because
they're really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been listening to them for literally
15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite ones was Ajaman.
[SPEAKER_07]: You turned me on to Ajaman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody was singing his songs with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just like took his breath away.
[SPEAKER_07]: He quit singing and would just hold the
microphone up to the audience because they
[SPEAKER_07]: were doing such a great job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Bubble On.
[SPEAKER_05]: You turned me on to that song.
[SPEAKER_05]: So long ago, you were like, this should be
your theme song.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was Ajaman, Bubble On.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you that haven't heard
that song, I remember doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really love Ajaman's music and his
backup band were really nice guys,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, Clinton Fearon, who's,
I guess, living in Seattle, did a little
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of I guess it was, you know,
in honor of Bunny and he just had his
[SPEAKER_05]: acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another incredible reggae
artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the guy by himself in his living
room sounds so full.
[SPEAKER_05]: His voice is so perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: His tone is just perfection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's just playing beautiful
acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did like three or four songs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those of you that don't know
Clinton Fearon, he had his own band,
[SPEAKER_05]: the Boogie Brown Band, a couple of great
albums that you can download.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something about The Devil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Disturb The Devil is a really good
album with Clinton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and the wife were in the grill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either the last time or the time before.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember because they all get kind
of blurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we were there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the really big venue there on the
beach when you go south of town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alfred's maybe here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the end effect was Bunny was
performing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He jumped off the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave my wife a big kiss and then shook
hands with a few other people and stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: like that and then jumped back up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it really made my wife's night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could imagine she would be stoked on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could imagine why he would do that,
too, because no one is beaming more love
[SPEAKER_05]: than your wife while dancing to reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, truly, I've been at reggae shows
with your wife and she really is in heaven
[SPEAKER_05]: when she's at a great reggae show,
particularly from one of the reggae
[SPEAKER_05]: elders, because we went to quite a few
reggae shows together and she was always
[SPEAKER_05]: like, there's no way the person,
the artist on stage didn't see her
[SPEAKER_05]: beaming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, we've seen more than 100 or
200.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how many reggae shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even some of the early Bob Wailer ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw him perform twice in Santa Cruz at
Pacific there and it was amazing,
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could easily see the difference
between the show that was about three or
[SPEAKER_07]: four years before his death and the one
that was a year or two before his death.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just did not have the energy or the
pizzazz that he had from his previous
[SPEAKER_07]: shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could tell he was running out of
steam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's amazing that you got to see him
pre-running out of steam and a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: running out of steam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone said, steel pulse guys are super
chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm lack to far-eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to meet those guys backstage at
the... I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in Amsterdam with Rob and I had my
two-foot roar in the crowd and so Rob kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of found me and we just took bong rips
through the whole show while Rob told me a
[SPEAKER_05]: cool story.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I know the bass player really
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't share the story because it's Rob's
story to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was like, we should go backstage
after the show and bump into him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wow, the guy was very receptive to
Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were definitely brothers from another
mother.
[SPEAKER_05]: He stopped everything when he saw Rob and
ran over and gave him a big hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have an incredible history.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were friends for both here and
further south.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was also a cool experience to just
be like, I like meeting kind of bands that
[SPEAKER_05]: I adore and love in that situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never want to go backstage as the rando
meet-and-greet guy and just be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, those guys weren't as nice
as I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, no shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You interrupted them while they were
working.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth, Marcus, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't understand that
they're showing up to work tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you meet them with a friend,
that becomes quite different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we all want to meet these
amazing musicians that have inspired our
[SPEAKER_05]: lives and created the backdrop for the
soundtrack of our lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you want to meet those guys and
give them high fives and respect and be
[SPEAKER_05]: like, man, I love what you're doing and I
just want to be supportive of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's definitely a right way to do
it and a wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned that many years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he would fly into Amsterdam,
when he checked into his hotel,
[SPEAKER_07]: he'd give me a call and tell me this hotel
room number so that I could dip over there
[SPEAKER_07]: and help him get herbalated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get herbalated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you those guys weren't smoking the
hash, though, were they?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, some of them did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You really smoked a little bit of the
hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly, they smoked herb, but they would
also put a little bit of hash in their
[SPEAKER_07]: joints or even pop on the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when we were in Jamaica,
huge amounts of the really hardcore guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: they all smoked abs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark's kind of got this like Jerry look
from 87.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that one where he's like
looking down above his glasses?
What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing a little dress.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does have the Jerry look right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look at Mark's old pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has been Jerry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through his 90s photos and I'm
like, damn, this motherfucker was Jerry
[SPEAKER_05]: Garcia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us both your hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see your hands, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, got to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got all your fingers?
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be commitment if he was just
like, oh, yeah, I had that removed when I
[SPEAKER_05]: was 12, when I realized I was Jerry
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the Grateful Dead Yakuza does that
or something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Grateful Dead Yakuza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a Grateful Dead shirt on,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a Radio City 1980 shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, 1980.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, what do you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a nice shirt too, Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: 41 years, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 41 years, jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my 90s one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: His master's choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the MCA kind of thing where the
dude's sitting in the Lazy Boy getting
[SPEAKER_02]: blasted by the speakers, but it's the
Grateful Dead dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also reminiscent of the RCA Victor
thing with the dog kind of making the dog
[SPEAKER_03]: face into the old phonograph, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Nipper.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog's name was Nipper because my dad
had a stuffed recreation of the RCA dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I know because it has the thing
on his name that says Nipper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm impressed that you knew that,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you said that, I was just like,
what is this, Trivial Pursuit?
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy just happens to know the dog's
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know some useless random shit,
man, but to the deads, what a long strange
[SPEAKER_04]: something, something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A long strange trip, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, today is a great day in Grateful
Dead history because there's an incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: bird song from 3781 that everyone should
go listen to up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a 17-minute bird song and
Jerry's just off the hook.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my senior year in high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great time to be alive,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I must be 10 years older than you because
I think my senior year in high school was
[SPEAKER_05]: 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same with me, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that was the end of Brent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the end of an era?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Brent died in 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember everything in Grateful Dead
history, just so you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be a true deadhead if you
actually remembered everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents were lucky enough to get back
in the early 70s in San Francisco and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they met.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't huge deadheads, but they did
get lucky to see the closing of Winterland
[SPEAKER_02]: in San Francisco and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really enjoying watching the old
Grateful Dead parking lot videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone go back and say, Grateful Dead
parking lot, 1980s, Grateful Dead parking
[SPEAKER_02]: lot, 90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much good feelings in the lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're part of something bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saving the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're natural beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ecstatic dancing together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an alternative to the system of the
governance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Grateful Dead is not just
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an incredible movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching some of those old parking lot
videos to just really understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, this is ground zero in America,
North America, for keeping culture alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cops knew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, what was your first Grateful Dead
show?
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't remember, but it was in
the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the right answer for anyone that
saw the Grateful Dead in the late 60s,
[SPEAKER_05]: just for your information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go to a Honda?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was never a serious, serious deadhead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably saw him a dozen times,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back then in the late 60s, I liked
Jefferson Airplane and Country Joe and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dead is not as psychedelic as some of
the other music, or at least I interpreted
[SPEAKER_07]: other music as more psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that I'm the music god and
that my choice is final, but me
[SPEAKER_07]: personally, I found Jefferson Airplane and
Country Joe and yeah,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my personal taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dead were the house band for the
acid test for Keezy and the Pranksters
[SPEAKER_03]: when they did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that first whole experimental
thing mixed, the dead was in that melee,
[SPEAKER_03]: not the airplane, not Quicksilver,
not anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dead were the house band.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but imagine Sam was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just his opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just telling us where he tripped the
deepest, where his trip really vibed
[SPEAKER_05]: happened to be with Country Joe and the
Jefferson Airplane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there was some other people that
felt that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Yorma Kalkinen and Jack Cassidy are
totally amazing players and to watch them
[SPEAKER_02]: solo even nowadays is truly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jack Cassidy, Yorma Kalkinen,
huge ups, White Rabbit and Grace Slick is
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever been to the Emerald Cup
since Weed Zone, she was at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup a few years ago with all of her art
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, her art's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grace Slick is an amazing, awesome person
who's very intellectual, very much still
[SPEAKER_02]: turned on, a total artist still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that you're far off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the great people that have
millions of hours of psychedelia and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's good to have recognition to all
the psychedelic movements of that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the first one I remember was 13th
Floor Elevator.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a shutdown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how people do reaction
videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember for the longest time,
if you used half a second of someone's
[SPEAKER_05]: copyrighted music, they shut you down on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's people doing reaction
videos where they're like, let's watch
[SPEAKER_05]: Stevie Ray Vaughan do Texas Flood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just like watching the entire
video on their channel without basically
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, this must be a loophole of
some sorts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we need to do some reaction videos
on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Sam, did you ever listen to what
Miles Davis was doing in the late 60s and
[SPEAKER_06]: early 70s?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that ever?
[SPEAKER_07]: What I really, really, really liked was
the psychedelic sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, or north of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to almost everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to Ravi Shankar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to all kinds of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what really turned my crank was what I
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I miss music.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss live music.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss going to concerts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss seeing my concert friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss traveling for concerts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss tripping out at concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Colin, do you remember the name of
the synthesizer person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Moog, but the synthesizer analog from
San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was some incredible
psychedelia going on there, if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the dead actually were really into
Buchilas and the Moog synthesizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they used to do their own private acid
tests together as a band and just be in
[SPEAKER_06]: one room with a modular synthesizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I understand, talking to
them behind closed doors, they would just
[SPEAKER_06]: get in a room and just play with this and
try to understand soundscape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really where Mickey Hart
started looking towards MIDI and starting
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand, hey, sound, what about
sound?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's remove this idea of an instrument.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really talked about a lot of
different ways that they would connect
[SPEAKER_06]: with the universe and spiritually through
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very new to me as a younger guy,
because I didn't really, I always looked
[SPEAKER_06]: at that stuff as like not real music and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, you know, as you get more
educated, you start to understand that it
[SPEAKER_06]: is and it's just sound.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in how you put it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And super interesting, fascinating how
they got into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Buchilas is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the precursor to where we're at
right now with all these modules and
[SPEAKER_06]: instrumentation that's being built.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fascinating, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you put that person's name in the chat
because people could check them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: see like crazy wires and walls of analog
sound and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, San Francisco is always going to
be a point of awakening, but wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, in the sixties with the MK Ultra
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you watch a Ken Kesey documentary,
you'll find out that not just Ken Kesey,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also Ram Dass was part of those MK
Ultra childs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was part of what made Ram Dass
become spiritual and become an
[SPEAKER_02]: enlightened, you know, whether he's
enlightened or not, but a spiritual being
[SPEAKER_02]: on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Ken Kesey, you know,
just getting filled up from this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this lore and then bringing it to the
people, you know, a lot of people talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about them messing it up, but at the same
time, it was just an uncontrollable thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that the human beings needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's fascinating to see the
psychedelic awakening that happened in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about it plenty, but it's just
an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned them last time and I'll
mention them again, Sun Ra, if you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: get psychedelic and trippy, space is the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went to high school, the first year
was 1965.
[SPEAKER_07]: LSD was still legal in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how different the world is today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was also the experimental nature
that the sound due to the technology was
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, you know, Colin, what you're
speaking toward is, you know, you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that you're putting it together,
it's one thing when you orally hear it,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're not a musician, but when
you're actually producing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you mic it, you know, where you do
your vocals, you know, if people knew how
[SPEAKER_04]: many actual hit songs were actually
recorded in a bathroom because the sound
[SPEAKER_04]: vocals were actually awesome would blow
many minds, but you know, the
[SPEAKER_04]: modularization that the continued
experimentation between, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what Pink Floyd and Grateful Dead were
sonically doing really changed a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the atmospheric sound and access because
then they started, you know, the access of
[SPEAKER_04]: the eight channels and started,
you know, expanding, just really
[SPEAKER_04]: fascinating from just a musical standpoint
of just understanding of how the musicians
[SPEAKER_04]: would just come in as studio musicians
back in the forties, fifties and sixties,
[SPEAKER_04]: bam, bam, bam, bam, go off as opposed to
now having an obnoxious amount of time to
[SPEAKER_04]: sit around in a studio and just
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really push the edges of the
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, it's like Jerry Garcia said
that, you know, we, they always talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about how they got really their education
in the studio.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's really how they,
they learned was being in the studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: His quote was recording in the studio is
like building a ship in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_03]: playing live music is like being like a
rowboat on an ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about, you know, think about,
you know, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
[SPEAKER_04]: Club playing four tracks, four tracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, if you really think about that,
it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most drum sounds from the forties and
fifties were recorded in defunct movie
[SPEAKER_06]: theaters with one singular microphone over
top.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a, it was a ribbon mic and it was
just, it was just a single mono source.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we think about like all these,
you think of drums, you think of all these
[SPEAKER_06]: mics and it's just the, it's environment,
it goes back to plants, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your environment, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your environment that you're actually
in, that's creating that nuance and that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that intricacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anyone ever seen the secret life of
plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so beautiful how Stevie Wonder does
the soundtrack to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so interesting how in the
seventies they're playing with sonic
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds and you know, there's a new device
out these days called the Healy and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like a frequency healing biofeedback tool
and people use it for healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it might be a lot of
reasons to believe it could be useful in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden, you know, as a, as one of
those subsonic, you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the Schumann's residence thing where
it's the 7.8, but it could be any,
[SPEAKER_02]: any frequency and, you know, so like sonic
sounds and life go together.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you find out it's beneficial and you
want to grow cannabis by the acre,
[SPEAKER_07]: then what do you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get loudspeakers or?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that once you get into the field,
you just understand that you don't need a
[SPEAKER_02]: subsonic resonance because you have the
earth's resonance.
[SPEAKER_02]: These types of tools are used for fake
environments like greenhouses and indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, but you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some science back in the
seventies about the effect of sounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: the onset of morning light, opening the
stomatae on leaves and a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation in their metabolic
processes going on associated with the
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds of sunrise and the change in light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, just on the COVID development,
man, there just, there continues to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of papers and reports showing
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I'm looking at right here on a
combination of terpenes and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was reported by a group in Israel and
there's like two other groups that are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a lot of press now, one in the
university of South Carolina, and the
[SPEAKER_03]: other one up there in, in Canada,
the university of Lethbridge that showed
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD's impact on taming the so-called
cytokine storm, which is one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that leads to acute respiratory distress
syndrome, which is what shuts people's
[SPEAKER_03]: breathing down in COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there really is some biochemical
rationale and basis for not only
[SPEAKER_03]: preventative measures against COVID,
but also this paper right here is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: pointing out specifically the antiviral
potential of just terpenes and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD works with the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it's, it seems like a no brainer,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just, and I can't wait for the
science world, the medical world to catch
[SPEAKER_01]: up with this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're beginning to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a real biochemical mechanism
because again, the way that CBD impacts
[SPEAKER_03]: homeostasis and you know, cannabinoids and
full spectrum cannabinoids sort of impacts
[SPEAKER_03]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not saying that these
compounds are antiviral, but they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're showing that, I guess,
both preventatively and that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: treat the, the real killing part of the
coronavirus, which is the acute
[SPEAKER_03]: respiratory distress syndrome was,
and it's an over stimulation of your own
[SPEAKER_03]: immunological response that again,
I think the cannabinoids depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: your, your endocannabinoid tone,
if you will, can have a real impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: changing how your endocannabinoid system
is dealing with fending itself off from
[SPEAKER_03]: the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it also leads to believe that there is
a genetic basis for fighting viruses like
[SPEAKER_03]: the coronavirus that, you know,
the endocannabinoid system can help
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the mechanism on how that
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you drop that link?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Mark, because I've been reading
various preliminary studies, but they
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't actually gone through or I haven't
seen any actual study that's gone through
[SPEAKER_04]: the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I've been reading numerous
articles that have said that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to hear that they're actually getting
some actual traction would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that there's right now
that the research is very preliminary and
[SPEAKER_03]: it shows that there's a whole lot more
research that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before they really get to conclusive,
here's how you, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep yourself healthy or here's how you
can treat your disease if you have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the point is, is I guess there is
a biochemical rationale for why these
[SPEAKER_03]: treatments should work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understanding that rationale is
actually helping scientists figure out how
[SPEAKER_03]: they can actually deal with the virus a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is that I don't know
if you saw the statistic, but because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the social isolation and people using
masks and all that, all the other forms of
[SPEAKER_03]: transmittable disease, including
influenza, are all down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, if we can just get Corona in
check, you know, I think a lot of the new
[SPEAKER_03]: practices, you know, not saying that
social isolation will remain, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just our overall education on
how to not spread virus and how to not
[SPEAKER_03]: live on top of each other and breathe all
over each other, I guess is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm with you, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to live music coming
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see festivals that are now on the
calendar that are selling tickets and
[SPEAKER_03]: selling RV passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about doing festivals
in social isolation mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So God only knows what that's going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, looking forward to music coming
back for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my question is this,
if we, okay, think of just how we were
[SPEAKER_05]: just coughing in each other's faces,
never washing our hands, touching
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, people coughing into their
hands and then touching things.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people- Blowing candles out on a
cake, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, how many people were, did we,
did humanity, like, you got to think all
[SPEAKER_05]: the influenza cases, like 40,000 a year
deaths was the same thing as COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that, you got that from your family
members and from friends and from loved
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's how you got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, that's never been a part of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, 40,000 people die a year from
influenza and never did we think,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, like maybe we should try to clean
this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be killing our elderly population
by coughing in their faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd like to make a special note that
there has been a hundred days of protest
[SPEAKER_02]: in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everyone know about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: The farms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian farmer protests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's 200,000 and more people living
in trucks on top of themselves with no
[SPEAKER_02]: mask on eating food together, communally
fighting for food sovereignty and small
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it really interesting that there's
no sickness spreading there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder what's different about that
human reality than the United States human
[SPEAKER_02]: reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you talk about people living
on top of each other, you would
[SPEAKER_02]: automatically think of India or Nigeria
and Lagos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I find it really interesting
that they, they don't have the fear and
[SPEAKER_02]: the numbers of spikes following it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, India definitely has a
ridiculous amount of cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with quite a few Indian people who
are in contact with people back home all
[SPEAKER_05]: the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've definitely got it going on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you ever go to India, what you'll
notice is that like coronavirus is just
[SPEAKER_05]: like, put it on the list, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like 10,000 things that can
fucking kill you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even wrap your head around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's 10,000 coronaviruses that we
deal with every year.
Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: On an every year basis, we're dealing with
coronaviruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to jump in here about what Mark,
since we're talking COVID and infection
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that, and point back to the papers
that Mark was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the education program that I've
been doing is a conversation about COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how cannabis might have effects with
COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the starting point there for me is
the endocannabinoid system tone or health
[SPEAKER_01]: that the system has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every person's endocannabinoid health
is different based on all the factors that
[SPEAKER_01]: can affect cannabinoid health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start looking at the
functions of the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are things like appetite and mood
and, but one of them is healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you start looking at viruses
in the context of healing, what's true is
[SPEAKER_01]: we evolved being exposed to viruses of all
sorts, bacteria, fungi, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all going on because we're in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of our gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of our skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are creatures of many
different sorts, all walking around
[SPEAKER_01]: together in this body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned our endocannabinoid system
evolved to deal with all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, to some extent, all of those
things passing through, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: thinning of the herd, if you will,
of people whose genetics and or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid health caused them to be
susceptible to an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's true today with COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's a new version of a virus,
but it's the fact that I'm certain every
[SPEAKER_01]: one of us has been exposed to that virus
at some point, but we, at least in my own
[SPEAKER_01]: case so far have not contracted the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't allowed the thing to take root in
my body and replicate and therefore result
[SPEAKER_01]: in me having an infection that or a
diagnosis, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of what
endocannabinoid health is about is our
[SPEAKER_01]: body's ability to identify a virus and
prevent it from taking root in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the whole aspect of what
if the virus does take root in your body
[SPEAKER_01]: and replicate and start reproducing madly
all through your system, how your body's
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system eventually responds to that,
again, is a function of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is why cannabis
chemistry, again, it's all about the dose
[SPEAKER_01]: and the type of chemistry that you're
ingesting or getting into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you're getting it into your body,
but it's an aid, a supplement to enhance
[SPEAKER_01]: your endocannabinoid system's health
because the plant cannabinoids vary very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely mimic many of the compounds that
our bodies make to preserve our own
[SPEAKER_01]: homeostasis or endocannabinoid health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why science is starting
to recognize as they build data over a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of people who have been exposed to
the virus or contracted it or
[SPEAKER_01]: asymptomatic, all of those various
permutations of how this virus plays out
[SPEAKER_01]: in our bodies are really a function for
each individual of their endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: health and their body's ability to
recognize the virus as another and control
[SPEAKER_01]: its ability to replicate in your body and
or limit the damage it can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, cytokine storm, you know that
term, but that's what kills most people
[SPEAKER_01]: with COVID is their body's overreaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, CBD, particularly, I know that
one a little bit can tone down immune
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fascinating compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I regulate as well as down regulate
the immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and that's and that's the fundamental
basis of so many disorders like psoriasis
[SPEAKER_03]: and and and eczema and and other things
where your immune system is just on
[SPEAKER_03]: overdrive because it knows it's being
attacked, but it doesn't know by what.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like when Jean-Luc Picard
in Star Trek said fire all weapons,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just fires all weapons and there's so
much collateral damage that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the patient succumbs to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the thing like you say that
the endocannabinoid tone and that's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like something that is is something that's
nurtured, that's genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my wife and I were just saying
that old saying you are what you eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is never more true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are what you eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The molecules that make up you is because
you ate those molecules.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it is just the how to say
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we switch over and part of getting
away from the toll marijuana and cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: stigma is to is to switch over to thinking
of cannabinoids as vitamins, as essential
[SPEAKER_03]: vitamins that we need in our diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wait, you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a I was in a clubhouse early
today as I was drinking my coffee and
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to this fella who claims his
health has been turned around.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was overweight, I think a diabetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he had other health issues,
but he has claimed that cannabis juicing
[SPEAKER_03]: has literally saved his life and that
fresh cannabinoid acids, a fresh diet rich
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabinoid acids has completely
changed his health and that he needed like
[SPEAKER_03]: he had smoked for years and sounds like he
had done other drugs and kind of like like
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people just kind of did it
recreationally, didn't really consider the
[SPEAKER_03]: health benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now he said this is part of his
routine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wake up and make a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wakes up and juice his cannabis and he
does it every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he claims that, again, the
cannabinoids in their acidic form give the
[SPEAKER_03]: health benefits that you're not getting
when you smoke cannabis and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: decarboxylating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of it is that the acidic forms,
those acids bind to other molecules and
[SPEAKER_03]: create different things that are happening
downstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was just listening in this room
for like about 10 or 15 minutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but got a whole lot just from from just
hanging out and listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I think that it's fascinating
to me how many manufacturers insist that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to decarboxylate your plant
material or your oil while you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: your product or it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're really talking about is
they're they're they're making product for
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making product for any other
reason from the therapeutic benefit that
[SPEAKER_01]: possible with cannabis, not to leave it in
its acid forms, the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely have different effects in the
body than they do once they're
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he claimed so he had started with
full spectrum decarboxylated oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: like like you said, and he said he got
sleepy and it helped him with some of his
[SPEAKER_03]: digestive issues, but it didn't really
give him the full health benefits that he
[SPEAKER_03]: leads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, he still consumes and still,
I guess, vapes and still decarboxylates
[SPEAKER_03]: and gets plenty of decarboxylated
cannabinoids, which helps on a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: different level, maybe help him more in
his brain, because when you decarboxylate,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're putting things in your brain as
opposed to your body.
[SPEAKER_03]: But your CB2 receptors, which is your
peripheral endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_03]: are located from your toes down to your
you just everywhere all throughout your
[SPEAKER_03]: body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, again, if you're trying to get
your health in line, it makes sense what
[SPEAKER_03]: he's saying, because he's kind of getting
a full spectrum in that carboxylated
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids are giving him one health
benefit and the decarboxylated ones are
[SPEAKER_03]: giving him another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great description of my
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing about the coronavirus,
I got my second shot the other day,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so the nurse was explaining to me how,
of course, the problem is the spikes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, the RNA vaccine that they
give you basically protects your system
[SPEAKER_04]: against the spikes penetrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, what Marcus said earlier,
which was most fascinating, is that the
[SPEAKER_04]: nurse said to me, you know, there's been
no flu this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked at her crazy because my wife
had the flu.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's like, universally, there's been
none because we're washing our hands and
[SPEAKER_04]: wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I agree with you completely,
Wade, is that there is definitely CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in its way produce the protection
in the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have not seen the breakouts of
people who have, I know people who have
[SPEAKER_04]: used cannabis and do use cannabis who have
caught COVID, but a lot of people I know
[SPEAKER_04]: don't and haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, people are isolating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a longer study.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still fascinating science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone read the BBC article about the
gentleman who's got I don't even know what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're calling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a term for it, like he's super
immune or he's got a certain antibody in
[SPEAKER_06]: his body that is deflecting the spikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It acts as a defense mechanism against
those spikes that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_06]: Etienne.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't sure if anybody had read that
same article or had any thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know enough other than what
I read.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just was curious if anyone had read
that same article or seen that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually African-American guy,
which is also just opens up a whole vortex
[SPEAKER_06]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: A vortex of questions, you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, you know, they were talking
about how certain subset of communities
[SPEAKER_06]: were really affected by the virus itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to find this gentleman, they're
looking for more individuals like him.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I thought that was really
fascinating, you know, just just reading
[SPEAKER_06]: that on a basic, you know, very basic news
website.
[SPEAKER_06]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's any.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, Dr. Mark, I don't know if you're if
you've seen that at all, but I just
[SPEAKER_06]: thought it was fascinating, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read it just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a woman, again, going back to
this clubhouse room, a woman who is a
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said that she was aware of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was over 100 years of age,
this woman, and she's I guess is so old
[SPEAKER_03]: that she's actually never been vaccinated
for anything in her life, but she's never
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten anything in her life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's 111 or something like that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's not going to get vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think that, yeah, again,
I think a lot of it with viruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin has to do with how tuned your immune
system is and how well your immune system
[SPEAKER_03]: is able to respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this is different for
different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like like my dad, for instance,
my dad was in a house at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: My stepmom got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of my stepmom's children
got it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my dad was around it and my dad is
immune compromised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had something called Valley Fever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a a fungal infection that you get
in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was already very prone to getting
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just like, oh, it's just a
matter of day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a phone call.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad's got covid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was just waiting for that
whole thing that never happened for some
[SPEAKER_03]: reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my dad just seems to have this
super strong immune system that even
[SPEAKER_03]: though he's been around it and he's
probably been exposed to it, he's able to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, deal with it or it might just
take the form of a couple days of sniffles
[SPEAKER_03]: and just not be as as life threatening as
it is to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody quite knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Viruses are weird like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look back to the AIDS virus and
what happened with AIDS, there was most
[SPEAKER_01]: people who contracted AIDS, particularly
early on, died pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that one of the earliest
patients and I wish I could remember this
[SPEAKER_01]: person 's name, he's he's become publicly
known, but he was diagnosed with it back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early 80s and he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't he never contracted any of
the conditions that typically result from
[SPEAKER_01]: AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, AIDS is a virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people and it's to me, it's just it's
really about the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual and how well their body is able
to either resist infection or deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way that doesn't compromise your
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so genetics plays a part in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the epigenetics of our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like the cannabis plant in
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about how the cannabis plant in
our cells are related in the way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can care for our plants or care for our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant, if its genetics are such that
it's not going to have any trouble dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with molds, it's probably not going to
have much trouble with molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's genetics, you see where I'm going
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same is true with people
and how well a plant sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant is sitting in very poor soil
and is overwatered, its genetics may help
[SPEAKER_01]: its ability to resist pest or disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you contrast that with a plant that's
in full sun, in full living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: living water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is as good as it could possibly
be for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's likely going to fully express its
genetic ability to to resist pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: infection of various viruses or fungus or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it carries over to humans as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be really clear, I'm not
saying that cannabis is the be all end all
[SPEAKER_01]: answer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things about life where we
have choice, the quality of food,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of rest you get, how much stress
you allow to build in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things play a part in how
well your endocannabinoid system can
[SPEAKER_01]: function in your body to allow you to
enjoy good health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like there's a fundamental
thing there that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these things we have choice
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics you don't have much choice about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis can help you to find health
in the midst of all this madness that is
[SPEAKER_01]: life on this planet in this three
dimensional reality that we call the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, yes, here I am, stoned
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you wouldn't have muted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have loved to have heard your
laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been the perfect mic drop
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll happen again.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I feel really passionate about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like a lot of the health
issues that are going on in our world
[SPEAKER_01]: today are because for many of us,
we've made poor choices in our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, riding a motorcycle in my life
has resulted in some aches and pains that
[SPEAKER_01]: to this day linger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis helps me deal with those
traumas that didn't heal properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, healing is a function of the
ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all of the choices that we do
have, however you make those will be part
[SPEAKER_01]: of what your endocannabinoid health is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is part of how we respond to
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, enough of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just amazing how, you know,
science has to, you know, appeal to
[SPEAKER_04]: politics as opposed to politics appeals to
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why I'm going to kind of segue
here for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working for the last seven
months with a group called the Veterans
[SPEAKER_04]: Action Council.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're basically a group of cannabis
veterans who've been using medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis as well as other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've come together and tomorrow we're
going to release our first white paper,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is actually a green paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're calling it, which is basically it
outlines significant concerns within the
[SPEAKER_04]: medical cannabis community for veterans
and what we feel are potential remedies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be releasing that
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also includes Robert Randall and Alice
O'Leary's submittal to the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government back in 1993 and to the Clinton
administration, because that's how far
[SPEAKER_04]: back we haven't done anything here in the
United States at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sandwiched also in there is Michael
Crowitt's recent success.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, in December 2nd of 2020,
medical marijuana was actually legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: across the world because our friends spent
a decade getting it pulled off the
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule for off the 1961 convention
treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So medical marijuana is legal and we want
access here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're launching this green paper as an
educational tool for people to take at the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal level, other veterans to use
around the world, because this is real
[SPEAKER_04]: literature, real information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Randall, for those who aren't
aware, was patient zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the first patient to sue the
federal government and win his right to
[SPEAKER_04]: receive marijuana grown by the federal
government, which it opened up to 22 other
[SPEAKER_04]: people until 1992 when they
compassionately investigated a new drug
[SPEAKER_04]: program was basically shut down for the
addition of any new patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to see that reopened in the sense
that we want to be able to get veterans to
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to import cannabis since we can't
have access to the night of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I think we also want
to pressure Dr. Al Soli and them into
[SPEAKER_04]: actually growing medical grade cannabis to
the quality that we're actually selling in
[SPEAKER_04]: our dispensaries today because they're
only one patient now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be honest, Dr. Soli doesn't make
these decisions.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the NIDA that gives him a contract
what to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to utilize this
information to utilize to pressure them
[SPEAKER_04]: into changing and either reopening the
system so that cannabis can be grown to
[SPEAKER_04]: the standards that we're seeing today or
we're going to import it from countries
[SPEAKER_04]: that are internationally doing it and that
have over-the-counter products available
[SPEAKER_04]: such as Canada, Uruguay, Israel,
and the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Etienne, that's amazing that you're doing
this work, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad is 101st Airborne, first of the
five of six.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is full-blown Parkinson's, has had it
for almost two decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's been someone that's been
struggling with access and he's got plenty
[SPEAKER_06]: of access through me.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the type of access, there's a
certain kind of ideology that I think he
[SPEAKER_06]: carries when he thinks of the VA and he
wants to keep that camaraderie there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it from a lot of different levels
with certain patients coming from the VA.
[SPEAKER_06]: And veterans in general, they want to feel
that camaraderie, but it's just not there
[SPEAKER_06]: from the VA at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a really touchy subject,
but I really commend you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very hard thing to be,
you know, hard path to be on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really excellent work, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing it for your dad and for others
because we have access where we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to utilize our voice and
our privilege for those who don't have and
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have access.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who don't know, I'm a combat
veteran of Operation Desert Shield Desert
[SPEAKER_04]: Storm 30 years ago today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in, well, no, I was wounded in
Germany, but you know, so I was put on
[SPEAKER_04]: going from morphine to congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get off morphine, but I asked
the doctor, he said, has she and I was in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that basically started me off on an
exploratory journey into the underground
[SPEAKER_04]: and to try to not make criminals out of my
friends and not get myself murdered or
[SPEAKER_04]: ripped off, which, you know, thousands of
other veterans deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there needs to be one of the
things we want to see is what you have up
[SPEAKER_04]: there in Canada, Marcus, is having access.
[SPEAKER_04]: So veterans are actually subsidized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, depending on your
disability, you're given a certain amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of grams of access per month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you can go down to a dispensary
and however you ingest, if it's edibles,
[SPEAKER_04]: hashish or flowers, the gram situation is
applicable to whatever your usage is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want that same access that you have
in Canada because we can't go get it
[SPEAKER_04]: filled at a PX.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we have to go to a dispensary,
then we want a voucher program so that it
[SPEAKER_04]: alleviates the costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many veterans like your father are also
on a hundred percent disability,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means you're on a very, very limited
income for the cost of inflation,
[SPEAKER_04]: food, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you start looking at the cost of
cannabis, not including the cost of your
[SPEAKER_04]: paraphernalia, which Canada actually you
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you use, you know, a certain cannabis
paraphernalia, the country will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: subsidize that and reimburse you for that,
which again, we have none of this type of
[SPEAKER_04]: access.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our veterans should be able to have
this type of access and access points
[SPEAKER_04]: without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here soon, yeah, we're working on some
other things as well, but this is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: our first volley.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be putting that across
the wire at six a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: in the morning or so, but oh, here,
I'll drop it in chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can get a preliminary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on our Veterans Action Council
website on under projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is our first project that we have
that we've released.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just trying to be a rally point
for other veterans so that we can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure the VHA into these changes that
we want to see, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: veterans are an encapsulation of society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're a small piece of society.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to do our best to crack
the glass ceiling so that others have
[SPEAKER_04]: access as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just trying to lead the charge by
storming the beach and follow us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we go back to the German doctor who
told you hashish?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was actually an American doctor
and I was in the hospital and I was they
[SPEAKER_04]: put me on morphine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, they give they they give
you a button.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can take as much morphine as you
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was an artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a creative person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I wanted to sit and drool all over
myself, morphine is perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't like the feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like the sedation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like the coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing about it I liked except
it stopped the pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could not be in my creative mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm left handed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm always in my right mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I couldn't I couldn't travel there
naturally or as free flowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked this I asked the physician when
he came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I want to get off this morphine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, have you heard of hashish?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I laughed and he laughed and I kept
laughing and he stopped laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized that he was serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, look, I've heard of people
utilizing that to get off it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I basically said, well, where the hell
do I find that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And his response was, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try a bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got to a bar in Anzbach and
Germany and in my terrible German English.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was able to score a little bit of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very I don't think I don't I
don't think it was a full gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then how do I ingest it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got one of them their bar grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it was it was, you know,
it was all crumbly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't squish.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was, you know, probably
waxed, you know, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: They already made rosin with it and they
were just giving you what was in the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never smoked before that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, when we had hash,
which was very rare, it was the old you
[SPEAKER_04]: take a pen, you put it on the pen,
you light it, you put on a piece of
[SPEAKER_04]: cardboard and put the glass over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the the slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you grew up in Louisiana, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the kind of hash that you were getting
was like black hash or Lebanese red hash
[SPEAKER_03]: or it was never golden, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see golden hash until I was
actually in Saudi Arabia and I actually
[SPEAKER_04]: bought real Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that I had seen and everything
from that I would if you go along in
[SPEAKER_04]: certain areas in New Orleans, you know,
they would try to sell you scrapings out
[SPEAKER_04]: of the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you smell that, you could smell bong
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you knew that was fake hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other stuff, you know,
you kind of look hopefully for a little
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of gold on the top of it from where
it was chipped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I knew to kind of look for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we had access to in Louisiana was
crappy Coca-Cola press Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't until I was up in West Virginia
that I saw real hash and that I tried it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the whole stick the pen through the
cardboard and put the glass over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my friends went to a head shop in
Pittsburgh and bought one of the old coal
[SPEAKER_04]: with the glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a heating, a vapor,
a soldering plate on the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those that was, oh, we're going
to get so high off of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, oh, this should so
hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just no access to quality
cannabis or hash until.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually makes me feel a lot better
about where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I forget where because where I
am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where I need to kind of go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very small journey compared to
where I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also buying all these different hashes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No COAs, no, you know, SOPs like this shit
was like, oh, yeah, it looks like they
[SPEAKER_05]: press this with their feet or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like some some weird skin in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, but there it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were just like happy to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was lucky to have it to get you high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, the my I got to you know,
we got Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a little Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got red and blonde Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got Indian and Nepali chars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was pretty special.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Manali cream or Carvati, you know,
just like nice, nice, nice things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, Nepali cream,
which was kind of like way above that
[SPEAKER_05]: whole region.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of always the nice and
Jamaican Jamaican guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so the kicker is when I moved here to
the Bay Area, the only place I could score
[SPEAKER_04]: weed was actually going across the bay to
in front of the Ben and Jerry's on Haight
[SPEAKER_04]: and Ashbury.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because that's where all the deadhead
kids were hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could buy the eighth quarter,
three quarters, a quarter right off the
[SPEAKER_04]: street.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's been a long way to
think about how and where we get access to
[SPEAKER_04]: our year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that 18?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was 93, 93, 94.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to I worked at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was before I got hired onto the Cannabis
Action Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a night manager at an ice cream
parlor and I used to get I would close at
[SPEAKER_04]: 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd shut down shop at 1030.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would jog to the North Berkeley Bart,
catch the Bart to the transfer point at
[SPEAKER_04]: MacArthur, make it into San Francisco,
jump on the seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the 50 52 bus or 53 going up to Haight
Ashbury, jump out at the corner of Haight
[SPEAKER_04]: and Ashbury, score my shit real quick on
the corner, then jump on the other corner
[SPEAKER_04]: real quick to catch the bus going back to
the Bart and then Bart all the way back to
[SPEAKER_04]: the East Bay, which is usually the last
Bart to the East Bay and then walk another
[SPEAKER_04]: mile home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how I used to score weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to know that now I only have to go to a
dispensary and actually purchase it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no idea how thankful I am of just
that simple track, because that used to be
[SPEAKER_04]: a two hour track just on and trying not to
stink up when you score that that that bud
[SPEAKER_04]: from those deadheads.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit stunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, all you had was just a
quick fucking roll up and just stick it in
[SPEAKER_04]: your shit and just told that people
weren't fucking like staring you down the
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or on the Bart like, I know what you got
on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's young Monica and I used to live at
Page and Clayton, one corner from the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner of Haight and Ashbury, where that
Ben and Jerry's is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, even even up to 2010,
there were still kids standing at the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner selling one, two and three and four
finger bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would stink when you walk by that
corner, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew you were walking up to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a certain number of and I hate
to keep being pedantic here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain number of deadheads in a certain
given environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you walk by a cluster of like three
or four people, it would smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, isn't it funny?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like when the Grateful Dead
wasn't on tour, this is where they set up
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's ironic, I ended up with when I
was with Ken, I had one of only like five
[SPEAKER_04]: street permits where I actually was given
by the chief of police of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_04]: where I could set up and I could set up my
booth on the corner of of of Haight and
[SPEAKER_04]: Ashbury.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it was just really weird to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to score drugs right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I am working for legalizing it
right here with an actual permit from the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual sheriff of fucking San Francisco,
allowing me to give out the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: information right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what what's the name of that on point
record store that's like just a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: blocks away from Golden Gate Park?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just like if you if you're
the one on the corner there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one record store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my God, it's like if you if you
like records, if you like vinyl and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: in San Francisco, it's a place to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume if it's just down by the
park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can score your weed and go score your
wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get so baked and we go into the record
store and you could literally it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: library in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could literally spend just like hours
in there and you're not listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just looking at all the records.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was I spent hours in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: After getting high on hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a place to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, gone are the days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of getting high, I haven't
stopped puffing since we started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because we haven't heard from
you since we started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone said, well, it was Johnny B not
talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like because he he got baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think the B stands for in
Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Johnny Baked.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're sitting there talking about
the beginning of all the changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was going to make mention of the
changes, but growing and then actually
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about the morphine trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember that and having to get off
of all of the morphine by using cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and amino acids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just being listening, just like
listening on Clubhouse and just taking in
[SPEAKER_08]: all you guys and chatting away and,
you know, saying good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my newest thing, which I really
like, is, I mean, actually putting dry
[SPEAKER_08]: sift directly into my smoothies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of juicing the leaf and I've
been sifting those land heads,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, actually putting dry sift into my
smoothies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I showed it yesterday and I've been
talking about them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've really seen a difference in just
my mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everything lately, just in the last
week and a half, caught in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like when you know, because I
throw in the smoothie and I mentioned
[SPEAKER_08]: yesterday, I could taste a little bit on
my teeth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of yeah, it was like I was a
little bit there on the teeth.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the flavors of the turpines from the
sift is so much different from just the
[SPEAKER_08]: juicing of the leaf that I get that grainy
taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been experimenting, too,
by listening to a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_08]: Clubhouse and finding the best regimen for
my medicine, because I've been hitting a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of high THC and I see how that affects
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also want to see how the more of...
I'm just testing my own body right now,
[SPEAKER_08]: again, like always.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that it would leave like a
little grit in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even if you could really,
really homogenize it in your blender and
[SPEAKER_03]: make a really fine dispersion in your
smoothie, that it would still like after
[SPEAKER_03]: you've completely drinking your smoothie,
it doesn't leave like a grit behind at all
[SPEAKER_03]: or...
[SPEAKER_01]: I occasionally do what John's doing and I
find the taste kind of pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like finding little nuggets of
flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's those flavors that I'm getting from
those turps that I'm not getting when I
[SPEAKER_08]: was actually just putting raw leaf in my
smoothies for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I used to do the juicing and take the
raw.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to freeze it in the freezer and
that like put those in my smoothies back
[SPEAKER_08]: in the days after my surgery and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been doing this for quite some
time, but I really enjoy just putting the
[SPEAKER_08]: sift in the smoothie in the morning
because you do get those little genuine
[SPEAKER_08]: little nuggets of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you adding lefithin or anything to
your smoothie?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, what smoothie flavor are you
using with what resin?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using good food and I just order these
suckers online.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a dozen delivered to my door every
basically two weeks and I have different
[SPEAKER_08]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some I use almond milk with,
some I use a grape juice with,
[SPEAKER_08]: so I have a kai.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all natural, more raw food drinks
that I've been getting into and stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been paying attention to that type
of healthy nutrition like crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, this one in particular,
yeah, everything is really healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, I got a cold brew coffee,
bananas, cashew buttery, vanilla bean,
[SPEAKER_08]: cocoa nibs, roasted coffee beans,
mocha power and Himalayan pink salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the reason I was asking if you added
any spikes to it in a sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does my video keep cutting out?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that picture of you, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my head, my brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: For better absorption is what you're
talking, thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it breaks down if you use something
like soy lefithin, it actually breaks down
[SPEAKER_04]: the acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's more uptakeable for your body,
whereas it sounds like you're going for
[SPEAKER_04]: the THCA experience for the acid
experience for the feeling as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: the body high, et cetera, because that
would actually break it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm just, you know, I like the
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I might have done that in the
past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunflower seed version of it too,
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you've used that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also a nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunflower seeds or oil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the oil, the sunflower lecithin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say this lecithin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lecithin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sunflower lecithin actually comes in
sunflower oil that is a great vehicle for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good way to emulsify them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sunflower doesn't have as it's a taste
as it's pretty neutral.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's definitely a flavor to it,
but it's pretty neutral in flavor as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as oils go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my daily is being a smoothie with sift,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just getting healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking you might need some stitches
on that shave job on your chin there,
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just like, then I wiped it
off and I'll clean it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like having shaved in a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't shave for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a tattoo, just a
teardrop on his chin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means something totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was, that's what I thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: is not going to get a tattoo on his chin.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some tattoos though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an angle.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dragon that I chased and the phoenix
that rise above my... He's cracked,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he's not broken.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we're all a little cracked,
but not broken.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I wanted to discuss here,
and when you were talking about the new
[SPEAKER_08]: changes in the system and how you got into
this, how everything's changed quite a bit
[SPEAKER_08]: with the IPOs and being able to get hash
on the legal market, I find that over the
[SPEAKER_08]: last 30 years, growing has changed quite
dramatically in the last few years with
[SPEAKER_08]: LEDs and VPD and looking at the soils and
the microbes and the root temp.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so much different from when I
was talking with my old friends and being
[SPEAKER_08]: growing for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now they're like, it's a whole new
game.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to learn how to grow again.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the years of experience they've had.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I'm just touching bases on that
and how there's been so much change in the
[SPEAKER_08]: growing community in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been quite actually a new learning
curve, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Marcus, when you were gushing before
about your guys' tremendous achievement in
[SPEAKER_03]: bark, and it sounded like something I said
on Hash Church a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really complimenting you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of it is that anybody who has to
undertake getting the mass production,
[SPEAKER_03]: not at an artisan level, but at a mass
produced level, a product out under GMP
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing knows the tremendous
challenge that exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what underpins that is quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about quality and it's all about
quality at a reproduced, at a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: level, at a higher volume of production,
which is not a trivial thing to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that's plant-based, let alone
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's the tremendous challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last thing I'll just mention is,
as you know, I mean, any company has got
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Products is the P word, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But really when it comes down to it,
it's the people, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the people that make these products
and the companies that are successful are
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that know how to retain their
talent because if they treat people in
[SPEAKER_03]: this quote unquote industry is just throw
away, you know, 15, $20 an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: If these employers don't realize that
their employees have to see a future in
[SPEAKER_03]: that company for them or else they're
going to split, they're going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can't just be viewed as some
expendable workforce.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there in your lab markets,
getting once in a lifetime training from a
[SPEAKER_03]: pioneer like you, who's basically taken
this thing from artisan level to GMP
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bet you guys that you guys get like
hundreds of resumes of people chomping at
[SPEAKER_03]: the bit wanting to just get in there and
get that training.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like if it, if it goes
anywhere, from here, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: towards GMP level production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really it just sets the bar so high
that once you, once you hit that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like everything else working
up to that has been just such a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: nonlinear adventure and something done
with incredible headwinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you think about that stuff was
illegal for so long, taking any technology
[SPEAKER_03]: out from, you know, the way we used to
kind of keep everything really quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're all out on the internet,
you know, bragging about brands and trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get, you know, big deals going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's no trivial event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the shareholders, the people who throw
the money down that make this whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: happen need to make sure to defer risk
that it's done by GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not done by GMP, you know,
then they're taking a tremendous risk at
[SPEAKER_03]: putting products out there that are going
to be just, you know, falling flat on
[SPEAKER_03]: their face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have set the bar and,
you know, I hope we can get there soon
[SPEAKER_03]: here in the U S and I hope that someday
the border won't make a difference
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be able to get your product as
you'll be able to get our product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there'll be a free flow of technology
and commerce at the U S Canadian border.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be something indeed,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd eventually love to see it
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: How people in different environments can
use their terroir to get their plants to
[SPEAKER_05]: express to this unique method and,
and see like, oh, well, this particular
[SPEAKER_05]: area of the world just seems to really
like this cultivar seems to do the best
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it might take 20 or 30 or
40 years, but we'll suddenly start
[SPEAKER_05]: learning the way we know that the best
lavender, you know, comes from France.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second best lavender is in
the black forest in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, for whatever reason,
everyone grows lavender all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't seem to express itself the
same way as it does in these two regions
[SPEAKER_05]: in France and Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so cannabis is going to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many different, cool cultivars really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to shout out D Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't used this yet, but they sent me
their new blender banger that is supposed
[SPEAKER_05]: to just be absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like falling film, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dab goes in and then it goes up the
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is your heat source.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heat the sides a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really, as it goes up,
up and down the sides, you get your,
[SPEAKER_05]: your dab, and you can just put a marble on
top like that for a, this is a super
[SPEAKER_05]: trippy puke and Beagle carb cap that they
gave me years ago, but I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_05]: that as my, my marble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hook it up and let's do an online
camera demo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to do this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to, I'm going to film.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He 3d printed this dab tool for me as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is like a really nice dab tool
that, that, that unscrews from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can replace the handle with
some other different ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they also sent me his new thing,
which is called dimodium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not even sure what I did with the
dimodium.
[SPEAKER_05]: It showed up in like a little jeweler's
box.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've probably lost it at this point,
but it's a new material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he sent me these really cool tweezers
so I could pick up these hot little
[SPEAKER_05]: dimodium balls and get them into my
banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'll be doing a video on that
with the 4k camera and putting that up on
[SPEAKER_05]: my channel in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always forget to shout these guys out
when they give me these amazing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to shout out Brian from D
Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing I wanted to shout out and I
have to remember, this is one hour and 43
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes into the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to shout out my uncle Geo,
my uncle George, who we've always called
[SPEAKER_05]: Geo since I've, you know, been a little,
little, little baby, basically he's always
[SPEAKER_05]: was my coolest uncle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was my one uncle that like puffed and
was just cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: He drove the old seventies van with like
the unicorn picture on the side or the
[SPEAKER_05]: wolves, like all furry inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is just a cool, cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget the first time he gave
me a little bit of a nugget and I was just
[SPEAKER_05]: like, wow, like this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm connecting with someone in my family
who puffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was really the only person I ever
had that connection with until slowly,
[SPEAKER_05]: but surely I convinced everyone in my
family that they should be using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is kind of the case now,
but it wasn't really the case back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to shout out uncle Geo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was his birthday yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if he's like 65 or 66 or
64, 65, 66 comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to you, uncle Geo,
who's probably hanging out in the big
[SPEAKER_05]: white shell right now in his cabin,
you know, taking pictures of foxes and
[SPEAKER_05]: cool wildlife and just being an all around
fucking awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being my mom's brother and
just being one of the coolest uncles ever
[SPEAKER_05]: and happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's all have a birthday little toke for
uncle Geo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you guys want to say happy birthday
to uncle Geo, feel free to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday, uncle Geo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is his real name George?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: George is the name that's never done
spelling itself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, his is the French version of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually Georges, G-E-O-R-G-E-S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So gorgeous George right there Geo in the
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ripping one for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The furnace is getting turned on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he calls my electric nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: He calls it the furnace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, are we going to be turning on the
furnace or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to D-Nail as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solid information and stuff, needless to
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, hopefully what you're talking
about there, bubble man, hopefully my
[SPEAKER_04]: veterans will be the some of the first
ones to import your bubble hash into the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States, you know, because yeah,
we all got together, started checking each
[SPEAKER_04]: other on wellness checks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been this whole COVID
reality where we're all been kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: worried about each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you know, our veterans suffer from,
you know, 22 suicides a day on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've lost more to suicide, unfortunately,
than we have to war.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by checking in with each other,
we realized, you know, we could probably
[SPEAKER_04]: do some work together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then seven months later, here's our
first, you know, green paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So APN, what's the latest on Sue Sisley's
work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that continuing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Standby.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is at, yeah, I'm not sure exactly
where she is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of one of our guys, Rico Pereira was
part of her studies and worked with her at
[SPEAKER_04]: the University of Arizona and is very much
in contact with her.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I'm not sure what
necessarily is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we know, one of our other brothers,
Brian Buckley at the Hellman Valley
[SPEAKER_04]: Growers Company, they just got an IRB to
do human studies on their vape cartridges
[SPEAKER_04]: in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be recruiting,
I think, around 60 or so veterans for a
[SPEAKER_04]: control study of where they'll be using
real world cannabis cartridges that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can buy currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll go to dispensaries,
pick which ones they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a selection of us of four to
five or something like that to choose
[SPEAKER_04]: from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll do the study.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is basically on the effects of PTSD
because to do the IRB, they could do
[SPEAKER_04]: post-traumatic stress altogether.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going after the individual
symptoms to show that in the end,
[SPEAKER_04]: have the scientists go, oh, wow,
those are all the different symptoms of
[SPEAKER_04]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there's science that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an observational study, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rico's making me know that Dr. Sisley will
be publishing soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as I get that across my desk,
I'll send that to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, AT, and the study you were talking
about, though, the PTSD study with
[SPEAKER_03]: cartridges, that's just an observational
study that they're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's working with, yes, Niametic out of
Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're actually doing a full study and
replications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're also when his company
expands into Michigan, they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: replicate the same study with the veterans
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is also stating that the study is
complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: The results of the doc study will be
released soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's watching Hash Church.
Hi, Rico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dr. Sue, also, if you're watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we should have Dr. Sue on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we could we could totally have
her on and we have access to her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's a very engaging speaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, again, I think we
need 10 Dr. Seuss or 20 Dr. Seuss or 30
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Seuss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Ady Ray is also very well spoken.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like what I've heard from her and
had a few conversations with her on
[SPEAKER_05]: Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's another one we could be inviting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have her on our clubhouse the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ady Ray and also Dr. Sue Sisley works
with the DEM Collective as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet we could even potentially get
Ethan Russo to join us one day if we,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if we had a plan for that and,
you know, we could get some good
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'd like to just say Kevin McKernan,
you know, continues to do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kevin McKernan has put out a lot of
information, you know, about the current
[SPEAKER_02]: pandemic and then just different
scientific things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really love and appreciate the work
he's doing out there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited him today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Mark, also, just to clarify,
of course, Dr. Sisley was stuck with and
[SPEAKER_04]: for the audience, she was stuck with the
actual NIDA cannabis, which is the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that's grown at the University of
Mississippi, held in crates, fails,
[SPEAKER_04]: microbials, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: While Brian Buckley and the HVGC,
they're using, you know, real world
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that you can get dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Doc Sisley's was a blinded placebo
controlled with that ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, well, I mean, even even that
ditch weed we know will work better than
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, how ridiculous that they
still, you know, have researchers,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially people who want to do
observational clinical research,
[SPEAKER_03]: their hands held to, well, you need to put
a proposal through NIDA to get,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, University of Mississippi,
you know, weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That monopoly is just about to end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we're going to be pressuring
that with our green paper as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're presenting it and it's to be
utile.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take it and go educate your
educators as well as your constituency
[SPEAKER_04]: senators and House members so that,
you know, at the state level and at the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal level, because we're able to do
these cannabis through the VA,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least recommendation discussions in
these states that are legal and allow for
[SPEAKER_04]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to kick the door open for
all 50 states and territories.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the work's going to be not easy to do,
but, you know, this is a tool for you to
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize to educate people so that we can
change the discussion and move the line in
[SPEAKER_04]: the sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can import bubble man hash into
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's that's our real agenda here,
which is we need to get Marcus's hash down
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always I'm always talking with Colin
about certain things and I've got some
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations going with some groups in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe one day again, we'll we'll have
the brand down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, it's so much work to really
just do it in one place that I didn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to detract from what I was doing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just give you a mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I think we're going to be
might say it sooner than later,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the timing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like I haven't been having these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just always seem to go sideways in
the 11th hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I've had this brand for so
long, I'm like, yeah, I can wait for like
[SPEAKER_05]: years more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not rushing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market won't wait for you,
though.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny thing about the market was it wasn't
the same thing it was before I started
[SPEAKER_05]: selling these bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then I had this different
perspective than most people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had this perspective like, oh,
like so you can follow the market,
[SPEAKER_05]: or you can create the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are two different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're very different pathways that
may very well lead to in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're just one little notch off
changes everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of what I'm, you know,
trying to constantly convince my team of
[SPEAKER_05]: is that, hey, like we should be more along
the lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, straddling that line delicately,
not picking one camp blindly, but kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: straddling that fence on both sides and
gaining access from both those
[SPEAKER_05]: perspectives instead of only one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: In general, people like to go for quality
or quantity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, the quality comes from
smaller sizes, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's so difficult to bring
the quality to the big stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why Mark is, you know,
Mark is so much kudos is because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: super easy to have quality at a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always a hard, you know,
it's always a goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, generally the quality is in
the small, you know, small holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like what Johnny B was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things have changed in the growing
world and we've seen an absolute,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, let's say explosion of living
soils indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it just continues to prove
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say you have to relearn
everything, one of the things you're
[SPEAKER_02]: relearning is you don't have to do so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you create the bed, once you
create maybe a wooden bed or some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: a bed for your plants to grow in and you
recognize that the larger soil and a
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger root base, you know, is going to
keep a health to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe now you're using predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 30 years ago, you never needed
predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, 30 years ago, I mean,
who had a lot of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as cannabis grows and as cannabis gets
used all over the place, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the environment changes and more
extreme conditions are created,
[SPEAKER_02]: pests get created.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the use of predator mites in
nurseries and even Kangen water as Eric,
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, greenhouse down in
California talks a lot about is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this Kangen water used in clones
and nurseries and even for foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are some new technologies
that can be used, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: having living soils, beds, you know,
an IPM through predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you find you have to use a lot
less attention and that's really beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: to see and incredible amounts of people
are changing over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really right now it's how to build a
bed and how to layer in soil and make it
[SPEAKER_02]: last 20 cycles and then create the,
the, and then help.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we need to do is help
influence like the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in some cases, the regulations are
so stringent that it's hard to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils and a recreational thing,
but we'll always go back to green life
[SPEAKER_02]: productions and Steve Kamen went well down
in Las Vegas area up in prompt,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in Nevada has very stringent microbial
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they've had to work together with
Digi Labs laboratories in Nevada to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to bring living soils to a stringent
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are real forerunners in an indoor
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons why they've been
peer certified for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the ones that really made a
difference and they've really brought LED
[SPEAKER_02]: to the forefront, you know, and how to use
those proper, how to recycle all your
[SPEAKER_02]: water and everything from your air
conditioners and dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are closed loop,
how to have worm farms and everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: continuously build their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on 24 cycles right now indoors in
that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, one thing that's really exciting
is they've been recently able to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: hash to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ganja Gill, who's been on here a few
times, you know, has been helping them get
[SPEAKER_02]: their tech dialed in and green life
productions is now bringing beautiful hash
[SPEAKER_02]: to the market in Nevada and Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, beautiful works being done,
even in stringent high microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictions or states.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to mention, I've been using
bio controls, good bugs to kill the bad
[SPEAKER_07]: bugs for 45 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently... I like Copert over there in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt you, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come on in a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, people like Syngenta,
companies like Syngenta support GMO and
[SPEAKER_02]: really harmful practices on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing about Copert, and correct me
if I'm wrong, but they, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: produce bugs in non-GMOs and they don't,
involve themselves in larger companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that do harmful practices on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Copert's been a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other ones, plenty of other
ones, but could they sell all over?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was gonna say I've recently added these
to my bug line.
[SPEAKER_08]: So actually, and since I've done this a
couple months ago, my plants have never,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have spider mites or nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been living bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Living bugs for me has actually changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm using Familius hotspot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using spider mite destroyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using predator mites.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using mite preventer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are little things I actually
added to my garden for the first time of
[SPEAKER_08]: growing after like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I added everything in Kambani,
I used to try ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to try these little fix,
but I've never added everything at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was the biggest thing is
listening to all you guys and really just
[SPEAKER_08]: taking that next step, just being an old
school grower and not wanting to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: that next little, you know, that next
little, okay, I'll jump over the fence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I finally did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been quite a great thing of
looking at how this whole thing works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I mean, we've got to consider,
we've got to look at, right now we're
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at spectrum coverage yields,
the grower and what's coming from that,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Johnny, also check out some
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I have those too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have nematodes in my soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then injecting those nematodes into
your soil in a way that they don't die off
[SPEAKER_02]: right away, you know, and you can do that
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that you apply the nematodes to
your soil, you know, to slowly disperse
[SPEAKER_02]: them evenly throughout your soil will help
them live longer and in the bed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so I've done them when they come
on a form where you just sprinkle them
[SPEAKER_08]: over, or that you can actually get them in
that little thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We throw them in a Rez's and then they
just applied by water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've had two different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's often overlooked with
people, we still see it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: misdiagnosis of broad mites and russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really, really takes having a
microscope and turning the leaf upside
[SPEAKER_02]: down and looking at the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a trained eye can see it right
away when they walk into the, to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: to a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally the, the leaf tips are bending
down with broad mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often the leaves are taco'd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also that yellow look to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Swirsky and Cucumeras together we
have found really works really well with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with both broad mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also work for thrips cause it's,
it can be a trip thing too, as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using those, like we said before in
your, in your mother room, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in your cloning and, and in your
vegetative place is essential because to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and, to try and, you know,
take care of the colony after it's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower room is, you know, say it's too
late, you know, you're already,
[SPEAKER_02]: your, but your plants need to build buds
rather than worry about getting sucked on
[SPEAKER_02]: from underneath the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flat leafed, very flat supple leaves is
what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any compromise to the leaf,
you know, that there's some microscopic
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the spider mites are easy to
diagnose cause you walk into a room and
[SPEAKER_02]: you see white dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the worst case, you see,
you see webbing, you know, so there
[SPEAKER_02]: there's different things for spider mites,
but it's nice to maybe name your species
[SPEAKER_02]: gets, you know, persimilis and
californicus or two that work really good
[SPEAKER_02]: with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people use Andersoni, you know,
but talk to your local bug, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: supplier and if it can be expensive,
but when you get into trying to combat a
[SPEAKER_02]: situation that's going out of hand,
it's very difficult to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping ahead of that is always good
for anything, even powdery, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mildews or downy mildews or different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, prevention is the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Prevention is the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prevention is the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I told my family, I would do a short
hash church today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys want to keep
going for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can always leave it on for another hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to chat and puff some
bowls and get deeper into the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation, I'll kind of leave it up to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go hang out with my little
son who's waiting for me on the other side
[SPEAKER_05]: of that door.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to our son turns 24 this
week, Sky, his birthday week, so everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: can give Sky some love and Kelly for
bringing him in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he on the other side of the door?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's outside getting ready to go on a
snowmobile excursion up into a mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just got a no board for his birthday,
which is very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very popular in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can look at no boards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's without bindings and very popular up
here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so we're going to help them
prepare for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we are coming out Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, Kelly and the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming out to Victoria and to
Vancouver this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really hoping to meet up with
you, Johnny B, Marcus, maybe get a chance
[SPEAKER_02]: to check out embark, look around,
check out Whistler Technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Seed and Stone is a dispensary that's
highlighting an MMA fighting event where
[SPEAKER_02]: Elias Theodoro is a cannabis athlete here
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be one of the first
sports events in the world where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: legally use cannabis, not as a performance
enhancing drug, but as a food,
[SPEAKER_02]: as an essential element for your health.
[SPEAKER_02]: For your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to be able to go into the
ring and have a vape off his pen and be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to go right into the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really big moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the First Nations, the Songhees First
Nations is also going to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about how,
you know, rightful access to First Nations
[SPEAKER_02]: communities in Canada can be enhanced
through regenerative farming and through
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional medicine and and good products
like we talk about here and intentional
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, you know, I don't know how
First Nations could maybe interact with
[SPEAKER_02]: American, you know, Native groups and
nations, but I think there's good
[SPEAKER_02]: communication, you know, potential there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are very excited about what can
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The First Nations, different First Nations
groups in Canada are able to create their
[SPEAKER_02]: own realms still in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important for them to be
able to get education in the way that we
[SPEAKER_02]: give it and other people give it so that
they can help with their addiction
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and different ailments that they
have within their communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe this CBD medicine, Mark,
like you're talking about today,
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of this intentional ways that
we're able to analyze cannabinoids could
[SPEAKER_02]: be very beneficial to these First Nations
communities, which do have a lot of issues
[SPEAKER_02]: with health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of reasons why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited to support them
and everyone else because they have the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to influence other federal
jurisdiction laws if there's success
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big love to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate your heart and your
intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make the best out of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that backdrop behind Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that backdrop, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You look, no, no, no, no, no, you have to,
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an analog backdrop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Balinese batik.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big love to our family in Bali because
we have a very special family out in
[SPEAKER_02]: Indonesia and it's non-cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heart centered temple related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we appreciate color and sound and
gamelan and food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone gets the opportunity to go
to Bali, again in the future, they'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is an amazing international
permaculture awakening happening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the use of tropical permaculture
models and bringing that from farm to
[SPEAKER_02]: table with raw foods and incredible
recipes from the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bali is an amazing place to eat food,
meditate, resonate, and give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
