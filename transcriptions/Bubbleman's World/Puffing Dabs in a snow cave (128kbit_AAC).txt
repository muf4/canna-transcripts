[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you worry, always about a thing Take
it easy, believe me and never give in
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you worry, always about a thing Take
it easy, believe me and never give in Life

a time and fulfill your dreams Remember no

[SPEAKER_01]: you worry, always about a thing Take it
easy, believe me and never give in Test of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, test of patience Just like in the
days of patience Remember the man called
[SPEAKER_01]: Job He tried it for rocky road He knew
where he was going so he knew where he was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from Believe in yourself my friend
[SPEAKER_06]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sweet little table action.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so perfect dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it makes it pretty funny for
hanging out in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to get one, I was so close to
getting it but someone bought it before me
[SPEAKER_05]: on like the Whistler-Briant cell there,
the Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those little outdoor projectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like wanting to like carve out a
little like TV in the wall and then have
[SPEAKER_05]: the little projector in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be so funny if like someone to come
in and we're just hanging watching the
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for a laugh and a video of that clip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really see in here but that's
because we're in the dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the card of two.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna go one, two, three,
four, five.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got our colors going on in here so now we
can see a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash is gonna be mad cold and snappy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna have to gently, gently convince
it to come out of the... Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a pretty good job there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, we'll hold the light in so you can
actually see the derb.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going down, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's going on, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got two derbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked to be having derbs in your
igloo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you're here to be sharing some
more derbs in a new igloo.
[SPEAKER_05]: New location.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll drop that into the Magna Carta.
[SPEAKER_06]: Close that and then it's as simple as one,
two.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll cycle through the temperature so
it's at 160 right now and it's climbing
[SPEAKER_06]: 189, 212, 220, 230.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll get up to like 450 and then the one
on the right side will turn on the timer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was gonna say the timer on a
cooler.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks really cool in the igloo here,
I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually give it a couple seconds to be
at temperature before I start ripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, is that good?
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells really nice, candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still learning the sweet spot,
you know, not to pull too hard to make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure I keep it going for at least a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does taste like candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do enough igloo rips in life so
this feels great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whistler for the win.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how small that was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the stool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, it looks bigger over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it folds right out so I can put
it into my backpack.
[SPEAKER_06]: To cleanliness it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cleanliness is next to godliness as
Skunkman Sam would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeping it fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I notice you keep a very clean
igloo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as I try to maintain to the best of
the abilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do a little Airbnb to make sure it's
clean for the next 10 that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you crush an Airbnb up here?
[SPEAKER_05]: The igloo Airbnb?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a permit for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a little bit of snow dropped
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I could hear it crackling like
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time to put in more hash and one to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it the old one too.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little hole on there you can
carve too and it's a weird sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, once it vibrates, it'll be ready to
go again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing it, man!
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's a quick learner.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just so cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whole other room over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a slow sipping.
[SPEAKER_06]: More than a blast ripping, although that
was a pretty good rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a nice sip from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, is that ever tasty?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's still on the palate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strawberry banana from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, new flavors coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Courtesy of Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loose temperature now, but you can hit the
button twice again to get it up to temp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you guys could get a better idea of
just how ridiculous this is, because it is
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs in the igloo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, as if you have a giant pillar in
your fucking igloo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Psychological support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain people have... Okay, let's talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain people right away have a thought
that this thing is going to collapse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but to each their own with their
fears, psychologically with being in a
[SPEAKER_05]: confined space, I can understand how some
people would feel in an uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_06]: zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to be trapped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, do you feel trapped?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because I spent all my time digging it
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Building this structure to have integrity
to support.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like once all this solidifies,
it's bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we're going to head
outside after a couple more dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
