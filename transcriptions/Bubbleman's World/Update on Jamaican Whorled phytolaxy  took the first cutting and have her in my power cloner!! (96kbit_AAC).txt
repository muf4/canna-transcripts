[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I wanted to give you a little
bit of an update on my Jamaican,
[SPEAKER_00]: my Trippie Herald Phytolaxy, growing three
leaves out of each stem instead of one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even growing two, over here,
separate branches out of one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I just wanted to give you the
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have finally taken a cutting off of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the first cutting that I have
ever taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it right there, and I've actually
got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing safely back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here that I'm pointing at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Reeferman's Harmony,
then we have the Jamaican Lamb's Bread
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrid, we have Remo's UBC Chemo Kush,
and then finally at the end we have Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atomic's Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to tell you guys about that,
and hopefully I'm going to come back from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's going to be rooted and
healthily growing, and my mother's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be bushy, and I'll be able to start
sharing it with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Dr. Atomic, and Remo, and Matt,
and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you soon on Bubbleman's World.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
