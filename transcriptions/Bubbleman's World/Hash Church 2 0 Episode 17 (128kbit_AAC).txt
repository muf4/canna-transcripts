[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, welcome to Hash Church 2.0,
episode 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a nice little very chill session
the other day and I thought I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: repeat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me get the quick hangout sent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send that off and we will send this
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see if we can't get some folks
in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hello to everyone in the chat room
who's been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 133 people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were only about 50 hardcore OGs in
there earlier, but I see since we've gone
[SPEAKER_03]: live that we're up over 130 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all of you in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew some Bud Rich, Slothy Heads,
John Maddox, 70s Mama and Bingo Heads
[SPEAKER_03]: Lombardi, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Catchem, Smokeface, Red River
Organics, Johnny B, Johnny B, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sent out the link.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if it gets back to me here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just got a couple hours today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have a ton of time to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, welcome, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: What up, brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just getting settled here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chilling, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chilling.
[SPEAKER_06]: On this great Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny's ripping bubs.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning bubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning, burning, burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sent out the invitation to a bunch of
people this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that's just too loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole coughing and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bong rip thing will just mute.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just ends up being really loud in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll turn it down a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, skunk man Sam,
with the reverberation?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the only one wearing headphones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll kill that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I already went through several
incarnations trying to fix this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always nice to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The bonus for you is that it's like,
what is it, six o'clock at night right
[SPEAKER_03]: now?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not nine in the morning for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daylight savings time at your end,
but not my end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, so it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a time where it's an only eight
hour difference between Canada and
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we doing here today,
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone have a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really good weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just been chilling and working hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about everybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Much the same, although I did have a
little day at Whistler yesterday,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a couple of runs in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to watch my four year old do some
skiing down the mountain, which is always
[SPEAKER_03]: that's pretty precious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have been having an amazing
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's super special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty good up
there generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just one of those spots
that I'm sure every year we get between 40
[SPEAKER_03]: and 55 feet of snow that falls up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it just keeps coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll get we'll get March storms
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was at the Calgary hemp cannabis
expo this weekend for industry day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the event went on over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't make it today, of course,
and wanted to fly out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But quite a good event going on in Calgary
about education and what's going on in
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada and a lot of the new, I guess,
licensed stores that were there and what's
[SPEAKER_09]: going on with the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of good talk of what people are
foreseeing for the future and cannabis in
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just out in Calgary it was cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like minus 25 or something when I
was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last weekend it was minus 35 in Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was going to be at least 10
degrees colder than what it was in Calgary
[SPEAKER_03]: when I said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so cold out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, hopefully we, you know,
come to a nice, lovely conversation here
[SPEAKER_03]: at one point in time, a little bit slow to
start.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just it's daylight savings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bump up the clocks an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of it's really eight o'clock
in the morning right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I landed at one o'clock this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you heading to Barcelona or?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I got some ICBC stuff to take care of
with my own personal stuff next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a different kind of ICBC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine's shares a company.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just Columbia, Ultra.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran into Remo yesterday in Calgary and
he was blazing fat.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's headed to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's making his way to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be the last one before
high times screws up the whole political
[SPEAKER_09]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it's already happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know they bought it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, you know, I mean, the Marley
family, Damien Marley, bought a big chunk
[SPEAKER_03]: of that high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's got to have faith in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good news to know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been watching you IPO.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, have you?
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do I know?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone knows that you don't know shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fake news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fake news here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Man Sam doesn't know shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on, Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see you sneak in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is eight o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been up for hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I vote.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this for 15 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still can't believe Amsterdam doesn't do
daylight savings.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so trippy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just don't end at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or start at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got three hundred and forty
six people watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hoping a good conversation erupts
here out of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a huge plan, but I did send out a
little email message yesterday saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, if people want to join, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a good little time and should
talk about dab tools and how little
[SPEAKER_09]: screwdrivers work really well for getting
the full melt drive system out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: container.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like I like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll screw up what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just screw it right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I about to go look for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Mark Shaldone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he said he was in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go grab some some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the the biggest thing really
coming up is is spannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: International Cannabis Business Conference
with Damien Marley for the after party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I split in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that Flav is now in Amsterdam today
hanging out with Rick DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw them earlier puffing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to share pipes or are you
going to wear gloves and a face mask?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I went last year and did not really
share pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to I got so sick that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, because your wife got even
sicker and it just that was like the
[SPEAKER_03]: plague.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like five times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of the people at the event got ill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like if there was ever a
conspiracy, there was like some crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: virus that got dropped on spannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect it was just some random dude
traveling from like India or Africa just
[SPEAKER_03]: brought the brought the plague with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think every time I go to a conference,
they found really, really, really good
[SPEAKER_10]: hash and then dose germs on the pipe and
pass through the round.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's basically what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just get it all get it all viral and
pass it over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got I got to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also all the cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still smoke mad cigarettes in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that really just lowers my immune
system after about four or five days and
[SPEAKER_03]: like every breath I take, even outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you go outside in the fresh air.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just some Spanish dude smoking
like five cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like right beside you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of people used to get sick at high
times.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was because of sharing pipes,
because there was very little tobacco use
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it was just, you know,
well, that and the other thing in
[SPEAKER_10]: Amsterdam was everybody was smoking weed
that hadn't been cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get that that that cough, that nasty
fucking your weed hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's now that's like
that's the Instagram resin of today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, hey, we shouldn't cure this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should just like to cut this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just extract it while it's still
growing on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get all the most caustic terpenes
and then we'll take giant dabs of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have to say about that,
Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was on mute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, caustic doesn't sound good at all,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do love the Jerry shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which which which finger?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the middle finger, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the middle finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was it like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did he lose that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he get bitten off by his brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually bought the finger on eBay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam bought the finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And uses the fingerprint to get into his
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he's got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's one Jerry thing I never
saw on sale on tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun fact, he had to relearn how to play
the guitar after that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun fact, he was able to play the guitar
quite fucking awesomely after I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: was before he played the guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it happened to him as a young
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was way before he started
playing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it was not on his on
this finger or on this hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on this hand, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: His picking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was he was four years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before he started playing stringed
instruments.
[SPEAKER_03]: But damn less than a year later,
he watched his father drown in a river
[SPEAKER_03]: during a fishing accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like he was five years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That forever changed his life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's title is fake news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fake news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry playing guitar.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually drowned when I was three years
old.
[SPEAKER_10]: But somebody pulled me out of the bottom
of the pool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a similar story, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally almost died at two.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took my water wings off, jumped in a
pool and my brother pulled me out,
[SPEAKER_06]: gave me CPR.
[SPEAKER_10]: It literally was on the bottom of the
pool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can remember that's one of some of my
oldest memories.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can remember going down and seeing the
bubbles going up above me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't didn't make me afraid of water
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's that's how Colton got his
Crohn's, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like drowning in the lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn near dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full blown insanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about you, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to head to Spanibus?
[SPEAKER_03]: You never come to these things,
do you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're more like a science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands tied up in so many
different projects right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been busier, which is great,
Marcus, as you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in this industry, you have to sort
of go where the work is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fully committed on several
different projects, both in the hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space and never been busier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the projects are different and all the
clients are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, like when you're
consulting the space, you're sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: expert at the table that's making people
feel good about buying equipment or
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicating entire production to methods
that we're recommending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to do the best job we
possibly can to make sure that we got our
[SPEAKER_01]: eye on the target of where this thing is
going to be in the future and not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily sort of like where it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great thing is like all these
projects, like the one in Jamaica is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like the unlimited potential that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see it like when you and I go there
and when other people go to these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just unbelievable because,
again, you know that we can bring their
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate level in Jamaica to a whole
new level that it doesn't exist today,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is real cool because just given the
whole culture and attitude and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes on down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, you know, these projects where
there's unlimited potential is just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like just great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's why we do it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, when you say when you say hemp,
hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Americans say hemp, when Americans
say hemp, they're talking about CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Canadians say hemp, we're actually
talking about all the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the way it's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all the hemp growing in America is
for CBD extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mark, are you growing hemp in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's projects I'm working on all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now, Jamaica does offer a
tremendous opportunity to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not growing hemp per se right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been the trip that I made down
there that, you know, I threw some
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures that we posted on it was a
potential project with a group called
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa and University of the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, ultimately, there is hemp
production in the scope of that project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm absolutely certain of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things is the temperate
climate, you know, that they have down
[SPEAKER_01]: there to be able to grow all the time,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but the problem with hemp is all of
the varieties in a registered low THC
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties worldwide require northern
climates that are not developed near the
[SPEAKER_10]: equator or near the tropical.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no tropical hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no tropical hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to get busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you what, I'm just going to make
the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beautiful thing about extracting and I
tell this to people all the time is that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can pick and choose who can actually
grow good enough herb rather than try to
[SPEAKER_03]: like everyone in Canada is all about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm going to build my grow and then
I'm going to build my facility and then
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just process what I grow in
my facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it seems limiting to
me compared to I will just like even even
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica, for instance, I had my project
going on in Jamaica there, sort of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say it's falling apart,
but I don't talk to my business partners
[SPEAKER_03]: at all anymore, like period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of feel like, you know,
I could just process if I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been also a few companies have
reached out to me and I've just sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: been like, OK, well, we'll we'll suss this
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to start a whole company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally just go there and just
do what needs to get done, because the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom line is they don't have people who
know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially working with the
university, because the university is just
[SPEAKER_01]: chock full of people who have minds that
are absorbing, you know, higher levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: academic information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a quality university.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you go to it's one of that you
can't even believe you're in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you is on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have two proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is in that building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that crazy, though?
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got two of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opportunity to not only produce,
but also to train people for the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: is just it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks who down there who are working
in it, everyone's got a smile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's happy to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're happy to be employed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with herb, I mean, how fucking
beautiful is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: There is one way to grow hemp in Jamaica
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about, which is what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is you put lights above the crop
to keep it vegetative until you want it to
[SPEAKER_10]: flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, like you say, you can just turn off
the lights and it flowers no matter what
[SPEAKER_10]: time of year it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marcus, I'll say that like one thing
that's going on here in Pennsylvania is
[SPEAKER_01]: they uncapped or, yeah, uncapped the
acreage limit was at 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can grow as much hemp as you
have land for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Pennsylvania, there's been a number
of different companies that have announced
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is using that so-called hemp train,
which is just a big, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, auger type of, you know,
extruder that just you put the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material into a conveyor belt and it just
feeds it into the system and it separates
[SPEAKER_01]: out the fiber from the from the herd,
from what they call green microfiber,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what you extract for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you check it out, it's called hemp
train, the hemp train.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, one point five
million dollars worth of investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put this on the front end of an
extraction plant, certainly you could do
[SPEAKER_01]: just something like ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a value proposition that's pretty
compelling for building processing plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for places that, again, are just going to
be farming, you know, that point three
[SPEAKER_01]: percent or less THC variety of hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of Pennsylvania, that's actually
a great climate for growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on how the hurricane season
really shapes out down in Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: How those storms come off of there really
determine what your September looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can absolutely dial it in in that
in that climate there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that scale, it certainly does make
sense to, you know, separate out the
[SPEAKER_01]: various components of what you can get in
terms of value.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, you know, recover,
you know, value by extracting the fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know what varieties
they're talking about, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are just pretty different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess I need to learn more about
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the varieties that that I'm seeing in
the state, Sam, are predominantly coming
[SPEAKER_06]: from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of desert.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are not hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't grow them in most countries
because they are not registered in low THC
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some of them are, Sam, that a lot of
people I'm talking to are absolutely
[SPEAKER_06]: getting certified seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not quite sure the intricacies has
nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so international registration and
registration or Canadian registration.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are all different than what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Certified seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so could you expand on that,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could explain to everybody what
what the intricacies of those the
[SPEAKER_06]: international laws are and how that kind
of plays a role and how it get how a new
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar gets on to the registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm not sure I have enough time
because in a little bit I've got to
[SPEAKER_10]: disappear and I'm going to dinner with my
family.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it would take, you know,
maybe 15, 20 minutes to explain it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't have that much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, it's fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a seed registry for the hemp
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They require three years of growth,
whether that's in another country.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want you to have grown it and tested
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, do you do you want to do you want to
say it, Sam, or do you want me to?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they just want to be answered
because I'm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that that's how it works in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get the seeds into the
registry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually talked to the guy recently at
the hemp conference in Manitoba who was in
[SPEAKER_03]: charge of adding seeds to the registry.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, when seeds are in the registry and
they've been tested enough times,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't require testing anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a bunch of cultivars in Canada
that they don't even test for the THC
[SPEAKER_03]: levels because they absolutely know that
those THC levels like Zola Tenosha are so
[SPEAKER_03]: much they're they're below the point three
percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're closer to point zero three
percent, which is literally ten times
[SPEAKER_03]: lower than the than the amount that makes
it hemp in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how it works for Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're in a bit of a
quandary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have these high CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to get ourselves into a
situation where we get these cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: into the registry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's kind of you know,
there's not really a clear and precise,
[SPEAKER_03]: concise way of getting that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems a little bit convoluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure a couple of years will go by
and we'll have all of those cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think about Marcus five years ago,
there was no new registered varieties in
[SPEAKER_10]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was only imported ones from Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's Canadian ones also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome, Mike West.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way you looked when you came
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had the hat on and the glasses and it
looked like you were like just ready to go
[SPEAKER_03]: eat some psychedelics and enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a smile on my face, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and obviously, the the state of
Colorado, state of Oregon are working on
[SPEAKER_04]: their seed certification programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those programs are designed for their
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of groups in Colorado and
through two or three that I know of in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon that are working on that
certification process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, like like Scunk Man said,
he's obviously in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had industrial hens since 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gives them about four years that
they've been developing cultivars,
[SPEAKER_04]: testing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we've seen, some of the cultivars
that were developed in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon, when you bring them to places with
more blue light spectrum, there's an up
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation in the THC synthase and down
regulation in the CBD synthase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've actually seen some results where
cultivars that are certified certified in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon safety grow in Oregon or Colorado
being brought to more equatorial climates
[SPEAKER_04]: and they end up testing hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you'll likely end up seeing is in
the U.S., at least, you know, states
[SPEAKER_04]: certifying seeds, those certified seeds
being state specific until federal law
[SPEAKER_04]: changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on a as federal law changed,
allowing U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: companies to certify those cultivars
internationally, then you'll actually be
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to start seeing that exportation
of seed cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, federal law being what it
is, we have to operate state by state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many times we have to do research in
states that allow that research and
[SPEAKER_04]: avoiding research in other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good example, Washington state doesn't
allow any CBD extraction, but they do
[SPEAKER_04]: allow industrial hemp research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did some research at Washington
State University looking at industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp fiber processing into biomaterials,
whereas the university of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado State University, Oregon State
University are all researching CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and offering actually researching
courses in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll end up seeing that kind of
develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that's going to hinder
Canada's CBD production for the next
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years until we have CBD
cultivars certified in the country of
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's actually a really long history
of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: My family, when they migrated from the
Catholic persecution of the Moors in the
[SPEAKER_04]: sixteen fifteen hundreds to North America,
they settled in New Haven, Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They the Spanish, the French, the English
all brought hemp to the colonies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was before a lot of the testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we know of as some of the Central
American cultivars are actually imported
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp cultivars from Europe that have
become feral or essentially land races.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then through domestic propagation have
become what we know of as the the
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombians, the Mohawkans, the Panama
Reds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all Spanish strains that were
brought to the new world by the
[SPEAKER_04]: conquistadors.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think genetic analysis shows that
they're more likely from India or Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're they're Indian, Asian cannabis
varieties that were brought through the
[SPEAKER_04]: Silk Road to southern Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then during the colonial periods were
brought from southern Europe to the New
[SPEAKER_04]: World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously, there's been trade
throughout the Mediterranean for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond 10,000 years, but a lot of that
trade, we wouldn't have had trans oceanic
[SPEAKER_04]: trade without industrial hemp because
papyrus breaks down in saltwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is one of the few that they can use
for the rigging, the sails that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: degrade in saltwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it ended up being quintessentially
necessary for trans oceanic trade to have
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp cultivars wherever they were building
their ships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, who got to figure that out the first
time when their ship disintegrated in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of the ocean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I don't think I don't think we can
use this stuff anymore, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the way it worked, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: First ships used to go along the coast for
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, they got brave enough to cross
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brave enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably those bloody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Egyptians on the Nile.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then it was the hemp stalkers across
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Egyptians would be were able to use
papyrus reed boats, bundling reeds into
[SPEAKER_04]: giant bundles that were more buoyant than
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they would actually be able to travel
up and down the Nile.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once they would hit Alexandria and
obviously the Mediterranean Ocean,
[SPEAKER_04]: that papyrus would would only last for
about a month and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were able to actually,
I guess, circumnavigate along the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they weren't actually able to do any
trans oceanic crossings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is some in reading the Rob
Clark's Cannabis Evolution Ethnobotany
[SPEAKER_04]: book, there is some suggestion that you
know, hemp was as as the Egyptians brought
[SPEAKER_04]: papyrus to the coast and then started
traversing around the edge of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mediterranean to places we now know of as
Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Turkey.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when they started identifying,
you know, seeing the use of hemp and
[SPEAKER_04]: wooden boats more so than the papyrus
boats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this John McPartland's work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this what we saw John do in Leiden a
couple of months back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Jesus, it's been a year now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that is this kind of what John was
talking about, Sam, in regards to what
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't it all based on pollen,
where he was finding how cannabis had
[SPEAKER_03]: traveled and where it was located in its
most ancient forms?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, Sam.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using pollen samples, there's if you
actually go when you guys are in Spain,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you guys are in France, you can
actually get in the late summer that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can get pollen reports for the cannabis,
for the hemp pollen that's going over the
[SPEAKER_04]: the streets of Gibraltar from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, you know, the same wind that
brings sand from the Sahara to the Amazon
[SPEAKER_04]: Basin brings hemp pollen from North Africa
into Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that they're they're
able to do is look at the sedimentary
[SPEAKER_04]: layers of different parts of Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, hemp pollen is unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually look at its structure
compared to other other wind pollinated
[SPEAKER_04]: annual and you can actually identify where
different parts in the strata,
[SPEAKER_04]: different parts in the historical record,
hemp pollen pops up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to tell you approximately
within 500 miles, you know, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: at this strata, we start to see hemp
pollen appearing in these areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, within 500 miles and X amount
of time of where we find these pollen,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can assume that industrial hemp is
being cultivated or in that case,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was all cannabis back then,
because it's all prior to the testing of
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to we have to understand
that, you know, prior to the singles
[SPEAKER_04]: treaty and essentially creating that
definition of hemp for being below point
[SPEAKER_04]: three percent THC, you when Rafael
Mishulam originally elucidated the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical structure of THC, they didn't
have lab tests to be able to show they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't have proton NMRs to show the
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they elucidated the form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they had proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how he figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he just had it was just right at the
beginning of the use of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had 60 megahertz proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how he, you know, did the
structural elucidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you read the paper, he reports the
NMR data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was NMR that, you know, he used to
basically fully do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And prior to the 70s, they they didn't
have 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the early 60s, they didn't they didn't
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, it was just, yeah,
the structures that Adam said and Todd and
[SPEAKER_01]: others had had proposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which were close, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So prior to all that analytical testing,
being able to identify the active
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds in cannabinoids, there there was
no difference in industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we when Linnaeus described it,
he described it based on its
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics, but not on its chemical
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the whole differentiation between
industrial hemp and cannabis is really
[SPEAKER_04]: only evolved over the last 50 to 100
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to that, what we know of as the
Central American cannabis varieties were
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially industrial hemp varietals,
fiber varietals prior to 50s.
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you, it was a great it was
a great presentation by John McPartland in
[SPEAKER_03]: Leiden, Holland at the International
Cannabis Research Society when he did
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it starts the first day,
I guess, is a little bit more plant based
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis based before it gets just it
goes so deep into science.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden we're, you know,
torturing animals to figure out how the
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanisms in their brains work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that both Ian and I from Sagra,
we just we just we were just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what, let's go rent bikes and
drive around Amsterdam like this is I
[SPEAKER_03]: could listen to the plant part,
but now they're torturing rats and monkeys
[SPEAKER_03]: and all sorts of things to figure out
these mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there it has its place,
but it's hard for my brain to wrap itself
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: One one problem I had with it in
particular was when the guy was like when
[SPEAKER_03]: they give a rat or a mouse like a normal
amount of cannabis, like for their size of
[SPEAKER_03]: body, they can never tell that it's high,
basically because it's just like a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't you can't really tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what they do for these experiments
is they give them so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the equivalent of you smoking
like six pounds in a in a sitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they basically start to finally look
like, you know, they've got brain damage
[SPEAKER_03]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when they decide, OK,
now it's high.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do the experiment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you know, that's really good
because then they're really testy people
[SPEAKER_10]: like you and me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you digging those that part?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you into the deep science?
[SPEAKER_10]: I am interested in much, much more.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I do is I ask Johnny McPartlin,
you know, what's the good stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I go around and look at all of the
posters, posters.
[SPEAKER_10]: I check those out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it doesn't sound like I'm going to be
interested in the speeches.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not listen to them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that really stood out to me and
what Mike was talking about was pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: drift, the observation that in North
Africa, cannabis growing there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I assume among other places you're
talking about, like Katama, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Morocco, where big fields of cannabis
are happening and have been for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen manages to get down out of the
mountains, across the coastal plain,
[SPEAKER_00]: across the Strait of Gibraltar and to hemp
fields in southern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pollen drift is a real issue in
California with because California now has
[SPEAKER_00]: a hemp bill and a chemical cannabis
regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the real issues in local
jurisdictions is about the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between hemp and cannabis and all the
rules involved with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis people are rightfully
saying, hey, pollen drift is a real issue
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seated cannabis doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_10]: One difference is, yes, pollen makes it
across.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody has ever shown it's viable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody has ever proven that, you know,
pollen that can still germinate crosses
[SPEAKER_10]: the Gibraltar Strait there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you look at, I know in Canada,
in talking to Andrea Herman up there,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada's certified seed program puts a
four mile buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in order to be a producer of certified
seed in Canada, what's called pedigreed
[SPEAKER_04]: seed, you actually have to have your seed
production greater than four miles from
[SPEAKER_04]: any other potential pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Canada, they put a four mile buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington, they also put a four mile
buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't cultivate industrial hemp within
four miles of any I-502 recreational farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: The research papers I was reading was
showing that UV light from sunlight,
[SPEAKER_04]: assuming that you have a standard sun
irradiation, is going to sterilize the
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen somewhere between half a mile and
two miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time it gets about traveling,
the pollen travels traveling about four
[SPEAKER_04]: miles, it's going to be sterilized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's still a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing it a ton in the Willamette
Valley of Oregon and heading down into
[SPEAKER_04]: southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Oregon's having some tough issues with
the prices of the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The recreational cannabis farmers are
actually switching from THC cannabis to
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually causing cross
pollination issues where they're growing
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial hemp in land that's great
cultivation land, great soil, but it's too
[SPEAKER_04]: close to the other THC producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you are seeing some of that cross
pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cross pollination, when you have
hundreds of acres of CBD and that
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinates an acre of THC, you have
potential litigation that could happen
[SPEAKER_04]: between the THC guys are pissed because
they just lost their entire outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the same could also happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen in Colorado actually some CBD
cultivars test hot because they were
[SPEAKER_04]: accidentally pollinated by THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: We tested how far cannabis could go in
Hungary on industrial hemp and drug
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in strong wind conditions,
it can go 10 miles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually four miles would be safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still viral after 10?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes when it's windy,
it's also cloudy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Windy and dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of my nightmare situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Avoiding places where it's windy and then
because if it's windy... It also blows at
[SPEAKER_10]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it ironic that if you're growing
hemp, you can buy crop insurance for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing cannabis, you can't
buy crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can in the EU.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll change as federal law changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an unfortunate part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, what I'm seeing in Oregon
specifically, if I'm going to cultivate
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 or 1,000 acres of CBD hemp and try and
sell it at a price that is competitive in
[SPEAKER_04]: the price, depending on how heavily
extracted it has to get to, whether it has
[SPEAKER_04]: to be distillate or isolate, THC free
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to excuse myself, but I've got to
leave for my dinner.
[SPEAKER_10]: So bye bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great dinner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good dinner, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for stopping in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a short one today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go at 11 myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got another hour and 20 minutes to
shoot the proverbial cannabis shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll have to all go our separate
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a feeling it won't be very hard
to burn through another hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: With you guys here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm burning right here right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just keep going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So see, Mike, in the state of
Massachusetts, what we're up against with
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Valley is we can't even if I wanted
to plant 100 acres and extract that CBD at
[SPEAKER_06]: all and put it on my shelf, I have to have
that come from a drug cultivar per the
[SPEAKER_06]: rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a backwards way to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that they're trying to do is
prevent people from doing what the large
[SPEAKER_06]: big boys are doing, which are just coming
in the state, setting up, running the CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: game as a as a monomolecular extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, CBD as an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you source CBD as an ingredient?
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to grow it from the drug cultivars
that I select.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have plenty of them, which is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, as I investigate into into
doing this, the way that I see it being
[SPEAKER_06]: most beneficial, it's just you hit a wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you literally are.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, at the gas station,
you can buy CBD tinctures and lollipops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so dogmatic, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like thinking to myself,
like, wow, really, guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm sure it'll change over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all this is a great experiment,
as I like to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, each we're all trying to
learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no one's got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one one new development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you read the farm bill,
it says nothing about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guy who made the response,
the irresponsible comments from the FDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Gottlieb, he retired or all of a
sudden stepped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to think that, you know,
Trump is only going to put a pro CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: person in there at the top of the FDA to
sort of resolve this issue, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, there's a lot of, you know,
things hanging in the balance,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is really it's an
interpretation of what's the law and not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily what one bureaucrat who's here
today gone tomorrow says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on the rise of cannabinoids is more
efficacious than individual isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So absolutely in disguise, start doing
that breeding breed for one to ones breed
[SPEAKER_04]: for two to ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seek out those rare cannabinoids and
you'll end up producing better products,
[SPEAKER_04]: because as much as I enjoy creating CBD,
CBD isolates for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the entourage effect is real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, natural selection is really I
mean, and that's part of what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_06]: with Happy Valley is we have fifteen
thousand square feet for just exploration
[SPEAKER_06]: and R&D of of breeding and natural for
natural selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's not a huge amount of space,
but I can get a lot of real work done in
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to have that many rooms to be able to
isolate is, you know, really fortunate,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we get a lot of real work
done in the next few years coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to welcome Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Soil Balance has entered the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see you, too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been hard at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working working in this wonderful industry
that we're all trying to push forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been it's been the I'll tell you,
the the hemp industry, the shit right now
[SPEAKER_08]: is so thick in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out there with the with the brokering and
the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to come together with some with
some good hearted dudes and talk about the
[SPEAKER_08]: science for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it's good to see all you guys,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I'm glad you came and shared some
time with us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done many of these hash churches
lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's life got really busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like it's like we all had so
much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just doing all these hash churches
and then suddenly we all got really busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like really busy right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure you're in the same boat as the
rest of us, but it's it's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice to it's like Mark said,
you know, when the when the works there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to you got to pump it out and do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're all doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's time, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: The starting gun went off and it's time to
start working, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been doing some soil consulting,
so getting the these these United States
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp growers conducive on their soil
physics, their soil microbiology,
[SPEAKER_08]: their soil chemistry, you know,
really trying to circumvent those plants
[SPEAKER_08]: from going hot, because that's that's one
of the biggest problems that happened in
[SPEAKER_08]: like North Carolina and different states
in hemp production was that they they
[SPEAKER_08]: weren't addressing the biology of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the plants were going hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were getting stressed out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their Delta nine was getting stress
induced and and they were having a low CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: output.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a very unique plant because it
doesn't really show signs like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like a like a tomato plant or a
cucumber plant with its with its stress.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a little bit stronger and
it's got more vitality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you don't see the same signs as you
would with like plant parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Pythium or rhizoctonia, Bucerium,
a lot of the things that can really tax
[SPEAKER_08]: this plant and, you know, get you those
those low CBD numbers on genetics that
[SPEAKER_08]: should have hit, you know, maybe 15,
20 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just poor expressions, duds, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw an article White Buffalo Seeds on
Instagram has been posting some great soil
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wrote he posted a Cannabis Now
article that says Dark Heart Nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: identifies major virus behind dead
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've identified the HP LVD virus said
to infect up to 30 percent of crops causes
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plants to grow poorly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of guys that are like buying
these high high end genetics, spending a
[SPEAKER_08]: shitload of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're mortgaging their fucking
houses and they're buying this seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They put it in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, with this particular plant,
I would say the biology is even more
[SPEAKER_08]: important than the fertilizer for this
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, again, we're not growing tomatoes
or cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're growing fucking oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the producers that you guys all know
in Canada and the United States,
[SPEAKER_08]: they learned a long time ago that the
living soil was like the key to get more
[SPEAKER_08]: frost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to be able to do that on an
industrial scale with hemp for oil
[SPEAKER_08]: production is it's a new science that that
everybody's embarking on and trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're not they're not really
addressing the the macro micronutrients of
[SPEAKER_08]: the soil for this particular plant's needs
on that industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're more worried about the seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're more worried about the drip tape,
about the fucking laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they're not focused in on what's
so important in actually cultivating this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant that we all know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the consulting business is going crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The the the the the the new growers who
would like to get into the industry are
[SPEAKER_08]: holding back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of big money that wants
to come in, but everybody's scared because
[SPEAKER_08]: nobody knows how to how to grow this
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not they're not connected with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know it yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all really great points.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and to your point in terms of the seed
that everyone's buying is is
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately, we don't know enough in
terms of breeding practices specifically
[SPEAKER_06]: for cannabis to eradicate them and
identify those types of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you have someone breeding with
great lines that may have good
[SPEAKER_06]: expressions, there could be some there
could be pathogens in those seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and those things get carried on
in large numbers and people don't
[SPEAKER_06]: understand quite yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And neither do all of us quite yet how to
get rid of that that right now in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: what pathogens are there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's really exciting in terms
of what what the next 10 years will really
[SPEAKER_06]: look like in terms of breeding and and
seed and very verification is another
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, you know, understanding what you
actually have versus what you're told you
[SPEAKER_06]: have.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big, big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, I've heard some nightmare
stories of people buying huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: these CBD cultivars and right planting out
acres of it and being like, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, I've seen it in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's brutal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, like to your point,
you know, we have these younger growers
[SPEAKER_06]: that just don't understand the plant
itself and the species.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to adapt other practices
from other species to this species.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just sometimes doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really have to spend time with it
to truly understand the intricacies of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, that's a very fair
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you're talking about before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's some topical discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're in the first week of March.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally speaking, it's a little bit too
cold to start putting plants outside,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there is a ton of things you can start
to do working in your garden to start
[SPEAKER_04]: getting your soil beds composted,
adding adding cover crops and amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you what do you guys goals for
this month to get the gardens ready for
[SPEAKER_04]: the summer next couple of months?
[SPEAKER_09]: Terminate some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it depends on the large,
big or small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, the whole no till thing
really took a cue from from crop rotation
[SPEAKER_06]: and large scale farming or at least
organic farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot to take from both sides
of what's happening indoor and traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: farming and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really depends on your end goal
and what you're you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I think there's a there's a
plethora of things you can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends on what you're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're doing to kind of help these
guys prepare is we're doing bio available
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrient analysis of the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, before our guys actually go in
and move forward with some of these larger
[SPEAKER_08]: acreage production operations,
what we're really trying to do is is
[SPEAKER_08]: understand what that plant is going to be
able to absorb with regards to the macro
[SPEAKER_08]: micronutrients before they even plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way we know if they're going to
have a good crop or they're going to get,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, in trouble throughout the year
because, you know, if you're, for
[SPEAKER_08]: instance, you're you're way too alkaline
or if your cat on exchange isn't good or
[SPEAKER_08]: if you don't have the appropriate
caldomag, what's happening right now in
[SPEAKER_08]: the States is these these growers are
going to the universities and looking at
[SPEAKER_08]: total plant or total nutrients in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not looking what's actually plant
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so their mineral and fertile
fertilizer recommendations are way off
[SPEAKER_08]: putting in way too much maybe nitrogen or
too much phosphorus when that plant can
[SPEAKER_08]: have a problem, especially with a lot of
these guys trying to grow organic for the
[SPEAKER_08]: first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said, those sustainable
cultivation methodologies are not really
[SPEAKER_08]: being addressed much less than the
biology.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what we do is we go in like I had a
grower in Arizona that wanted to grow a
[SPEAKER_08]: thousand acres of hemp and we tested his
soils and he was like at eight point nine
[SPEAKER_08]: pH, you know, is is they and because of
that they had put in sulfur into the soil
[SPEAKER_08]: to try and regulate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but they did a bad job.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now he had sulfur toxicity.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had magnesium toxicity.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy was going to put two million
dollars, two million dollars of his own
[SPEAKER_08]: money in to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's trying to find the genetics
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I told him, I was like, you're going
to have an uphill battle on this soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and so I think for most growers
out there that are considering getting
[SPEAKER_08]: into hemp, the first thing that you really
need to do is is get that CO2 extraction
[SPEAKER_08]: done of the soil nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, looking at how much phosphorus,
how much potassium, how much nitrogen your
[SPEAKER_08]: plants are actually going to be able to
absorb versus how much is in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a different type of extraction
method that we do that that looks at
[SPEAKER_08]: bioavailable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, to further assist
these guys, they need to do leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_08]: and sap analysis throughout the season to
actually see, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're talking commercial or industrial
scale hemp cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend orange photonics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not perfect, but in the field,
it's very helpful to give you a really
[SPEAKER_06]: great understanding of where you're
falling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just every week, just get in there and
start taking samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd recommend that to every large scale
hemp farmer out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important to understand where
you're falling along the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it gives you those data points to
make better informative choices for your
[SPEAKER_06]: next season or even the cultivars that
you're running.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what those choices are, that's the
thing that not a lot of people know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how much magnesium do I need in the
vegetative state?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to your point with the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the types of things that
throw your heavy metal testing off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the metals go up into the heads
and they stay there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once they're there, it's locked in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's locked and loaded.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're never coming out unless you blast
it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something you have to take into
consideration in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then there's the whole, you know,
layers to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then you want to take into account the
energetics that this plant necessitates,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like paramagnetism or, you know,
biodynamics or some of the other layers
[SPEAKER_08]: that are so conducive.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, going back to the life in that
soil, the biggest caveat that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_08]: right now or the biggest hardship that a
lot of these growers are going to undergo
[SPEAKER_08]: unknowingly in Canada, as well as the
United States for high oil production,
[SPEAKER_08]: all falls back into that biological system
because there are microorganisms that are
[SPEAKER_08]: signaling that plant to increase the CBD
synthase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're not indigenous within that
soil, you know, that's not giving that
[SPEAKER_08]: plant its familiar microbial partners that
it co-evolved with in nature, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so all of the terpenes, many of the
terpenes, many of the precursors to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids are actually biosynthesized
in the soil microbiota.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bacteria, the endo-ectobacteria,
which are the bacteria lived inside
[SPEAKER_04]: outside, as well as the fungi will
actually mine the soil for minerals,
[SPEAKER_04]: mine the soil for nitrifying bacteria will
actually fix nitrogen into nitrates and
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrates and actually bring it up to the
cannabis plant and exchange it for sugar
[SPEAKER_04]: because most of those soil bacteria don't
produce sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they form a symbiotic relationship with
the cannabis plant where the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: provides the sugar and in exchange,
the symbiotic microflora in the soil will
[SPEAKER_04]: end up providing all the precursors that
the cannabis plant needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being able to set your soil up in
really nice biodynamic soil before you
[SPEAKER_04]: even get your plants in the soil is a
great way to start the season.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you're talking about this
because last week, I just did a transplant
[SPEAKER_09]: and I transplanted all of my plants into
this root product soil conditioner by Dr.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually just have it on my screen
right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to show you, I'm using
this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask you about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you were just talking about this
because I was just actually really
[SPEAKER_09]: considering what I'm doing in my soils and
adding some extras to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I was looking at your soil
balance pro little bag sitting there and I
[SPEAKER_09]: tried the Dr. Mary Jane's for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just kind of, you know,
this is more like the home grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one little package into like a five
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I let it sit for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did my transplant and I split my room in
half again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can already see a difference within
a week of the plants that are in these
[SPEAKER_09]: root product soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, damn, I should have did the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you could definitely see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always recommend extreme gardening for a
lot of indoor growers that are trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: mend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think their products are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of, my coast is really
nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for transplanting and it's easy
and fairly quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was the whole thing for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always gone back and tried getting
into doing these living soils and stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll think about doing that on an
industrial scale, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great conversation for people to
really understand on the industrial and
[SPEAKER_09]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then as a home grower and getting into
those soils, cause I've noticed my
[SPEAKER_09]: difference in my growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody sees it and I have these
different walkouts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really taking a really good look at
the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And using these root products and stuff
like that is, is key.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, it's just been, it's just been
interesting, you know, all these,
[SPEAKER_08]: all our brothers and our friends and our
family, like in the Humboldt County man
[SPEAKER_08]: growing, like the best cannabis in the
world or wherever the best cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Canada has got some of the best
grass in the world, but, but most of those
[SPEAKER_08]: growers have gotten to a place point where
they understand that, that it's that
[SPEAKER_08]: living soil that's going to give you that
frost, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And why, why is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to be able to replicate that on an
industrial scale, they get CBD levels to
[SPEAKER_08]: like 18%, you know, with the CBD synthase
enzyme, it goes back to what you were
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about with regards to the nutrient
absorption, the foundation, as well as
[SPEAKER_08]: the, the enzymatic communication of those
microbes with the plant to create more
[SPEAKER_08]: oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've found a huge correlation with
bricks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to further quantify your hypothesis on
the, the nutrient absorption leading to
[SPEAKER_08]: that, that foundation, it's right on the
money, dude, because the more glucose,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, or the bricks reading that we're
finding is, is, is again, it's,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's right now we're, we're, we're seeing
this connection.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't proven it, but, but those
bricks are to all oils, glucose is the
[SPEAKER_08]: precursor to all oils.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so once you're summation, yeah,
well said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what I wanted to disclose
is that that bricks level, when you go out
[SPEAKER_08]: and test that leaf, and if your sugar
content is higher in one versus the other,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you've got glucose, which is
going to actually cellularly transform
[SPEAKER_08]: into the CBD synthase enzyme, as well as
the full cannabinoid spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sugar in the plant, that glucose
is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good shit right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It turns into fucking hash dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put a shout out to the
science of regenerative cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: soil farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a conference up in BC,
Mark and I were able to attend,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think they've been having a couple.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one more that they're going to be
live streaming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, is that last one in Michigan?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, you know, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I just invite Joshua in and
maybe he can cool.
Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one in Maine that just happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, Mike and I were in Vancouver for
the Lyft conference while simultaneously
[SPEAKER_03]: the regenerative conference was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we spoke at that on a panel along with
my partner, Daniel from Whistler
[SPEAKER_03]: Technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, it was like our people in
that room, you know, really conscious,
[SPEAKER_03]: really the work that Joshua was doing by
putting all those people together is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to meet Kevin Jodfri and got to meet
Kaia from the infamous Kaia has coffee,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I'm actually puffing on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just some really great folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my friends came up from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely a very good,
a very good conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met, I met Tara Lee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tara Lee was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's one of our OGs in the hash church
chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I don't know if Joshua was going
to get that in time, but I hit him up with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonetheless, I, I tried to send him the
email, but it would not, I don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I don't know Joshua's email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when I sent out the, the thing
yesterday, I meant to send it to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I even might've mentioned if
someone could forward it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check if anybody is in and around,
I think it's in Michigan is this last one,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're, if they're, if you're near
the Midwest, the last one is coming up in
[SPEAKER_04]: the next week or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you, if you're not in the Midwest,
they're going to be live streaming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can actually, actually record it
and make it available to everybody who's
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't want to drive to the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if many of the viewers want to,
I guess, watch some awesome speakers learn
[SPEAKER_04]: about buildings, building soils more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very much like a hash church
in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just have some really great people
dropping some serious knowledge and it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes on for hours and then you can talk
with them afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, I would definitely suggest if
you're in and around the neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would drive hours personally to go,
to go see that just I'm sure they'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: great people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the dragon fly earth medicine crew
is back from Bali literally the next day
[SPEAKER_03]: they fly to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff, Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that's key information getting
down this rabbit hole a little deeper and
[SPEAKER_03]: just understanding, you know, like what do
we want to be feeding this plant and how
[SPEAKER_03]: did the variables change what we want to
be feeding the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what are the ratios and how do they
change when suddenly we're growing at a
[SPEAKER_03]: different altitude or we're growing in a
different environment completely with all
[SPEAKER_03]: different variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why this plant just seems to
offer us an endlessly complex rabbit hole
[SPEAKER_03]: to dive down into with all these other
little mini rabbit holes that go off the
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's why so many of us have so many
different interests in this plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: still can sit around and talk for hours,
whether you're, you know, focused on the
[SPEAKER_03]: science of it or you're focused on the
biology or you're focused on the botany or
[SPEAKER_03]: you're focused on whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty darn cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a, we got 500 people watching
from around the world right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: chatting about and listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I'm still talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to explain how a Bricks Bricks
meter works?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, um, it's like a, um, a $6 tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get it really easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, it's like a little metal thing
about this big.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, it's got a refractometer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically all you do is you grind up
like a leaf of a, of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you have to get like, you know,
like a really good grinder to get the
[SPEAKER_08]: juices out of the leaf, the sap.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you take that liquid and you just
rub it on the, the, uh, the refractometer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you look through a little skull.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and, uh, and then it shows you the
number, um, of, uh, of your Bricks
[SPEAKER_08]: reading.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, that really determines like the
sugar level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's a very small portion of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think it's like one or 2% of that
Bricks is actually like your calcium,
[SPEAKER_08]: your magnesium, your phosphorus,
all your different things that are in that
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the higher the Bricks reading,
you know, usually what we're seeing is the
[SPEAKER_08]: more CBD oil that our hemp producers are
getting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like every time we, we test
non-treated treated Bricks, it's like the,
[SPEAKER_08]: the, the, the more oil, the higher the
Bricks reading and, and, and that really
[SPEAKER_08]: goes back to your, your, uh, soil macro,
your soil balancing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, on an industrial scale to be
able to come in and actually quantify
[SPEAKER_08]: heterogeneous soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they're conducive to the hemp
plants or not really takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: reverse engineering to get to a place
point where you can actually understand
[SPEAKER_08]: the, the soil physics, the soil chemistry,
the soil microbiology, comprehensively to
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to gauge what you're going to see
at the end game.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the biggest thing that,
that is going to hopefully lead us back
[SPEAKER_08]: now to more sustainable regenerative
cultivation methodologies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because, uh, you know, it's,
it's, uh, it's the root essentially of,
[SPEAKER_08]: of the, of the end quality is that soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so man, the, the soil is so impactful
in this crop and it's the, the,
[SPEAKER_08]: the most under, you know, under discussed
portion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just that, that, uh, that whole
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, go ahead, Mike, the earth man,
you know, yeah, it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the secrets that the suits won't
understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the suits are just looking at
trying to build indoor crows.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the suits and the roots, the suits
and the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome Joshua.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking about your
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike was giving you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter was dropping mad soil knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, fuck, Joshua should be here
dropping this knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, I love that you're like working.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like out working.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're laying packs in the greenhouse this
morning and I'm fixing fence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just saw that books down and saw the
text.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, okay, I can roll a jar and say
what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got one more conference going on
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Arbor in like a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shangri-La is coming out and excited to
hang with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it's kind of, it's kind of nice
to hold cause Josh and Kelly will be back
[SPEAKER_07]: in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been traveling abroad and so they
have, they missed the two middle kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it feels like we'll have the band,
you know, all back together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's funny too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Mike was just asking, Hey,
what are you guys all doing to get your,
[SPEAKER_03]: your gardens ready for, for the spring?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're like, I'm laying this and
I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, fucking rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have sprouted already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Wade laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually just going through seeds,
uh, pulling out packs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a lot of generous gifts on my
travels.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I couldn't, I didn't expect it to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I'm, I'm going to start some seeds
this morning, a bunch of cool stuff from,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a couple of packs of his sky color
Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super excited about I got to,
you know, I've heard a lot of people talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about his stuff and I got to smoke some,
uh, down at Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, anyways, I'm just super excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the Cali conference?
[SPEAKER_02]: The regenerative conference down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was blew us away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the last two just blew us away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to actually change locations at the
last minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we had so many last minute signups.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had about 250 people there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some big rooms, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great news, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's, it's really cool because it's,
it's, it's, you know, the mission was
[SPEAKER_07]: really to dig into the science of how to
do organic regenerative cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's still, that's what we're
doing and teaching, but it's also about an
[SPEAKER_07]: aspect of community support.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really come together, you know,
almost starting in Vancouver when we were
[SPEAKER_07]: up there, you know, just seeing that the
clash between the suits and the roots,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and it's big.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's really cool how,
uh, the, you know, the dragon fly earth
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine cooperative has been kind of
forming and we're figuring out how to
[SPEAKER_07]: establish ourselves, what we want to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the power of small farmers coming
together is, um, it's really been a theme,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's gone throughout the
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you one thing at that
Vancouver lift conference versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had tens of thousands of people
versus the 50 to a hundred, but all the
[SPEAKER_03]: best urban hash was definitely at that
regenerative conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not see anything worth anything at
lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, it was, uh, as my good
friend, Hillary said, this is just a bag
[SPEAKER_03]: of dicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you know, that's the one thing
that's been missing, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys are talking about it,
but all these big grows keep popping up
[SPEAKER_07]: and they can't produce the high quality,
you know, it's just not the scenario for
[SPEAKER_07]: it, but us small farmers have been doing
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it's, it's just cool to see like
the people being able to rally together
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of trying to come in, you know,
I'm my brand and here's my t-shirt and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we're all just trying to survive
and sell weed, you know, but together,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, just like we used to
move it around a few friends at a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we'll have a good market share,
you know, and can put some good quality
[SPEAKER_07]: herb on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, I mean, from my perspective as
a processor, I felt like we would have
[SPEAKER_03]: much more success with the room full of
people that you put together than we would
[SPEAKER_03]: with the people that Lyft put together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to bash on Lyft.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have a good time at Lyft.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying it was very noticeable to
me when I left Lyft and went to your
[SPEAKER_03]: conference and was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I, I'm pretty sure I even said it
when I, when I spoke on the panel,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, these are my people,
you know, these are the roots and over
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the suits and it's just a different
vibe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need, we do need both to be honest,
to really get out in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're talking about a different
scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're going to be, most of this
stuff is going to be going for oral,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we got to be all inclusive to
the people who have, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: are just getting into the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who are just trying to just
starting their businesses, as well as the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a lot of us, as well as the
viewers are people who range in
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That have just started growing their first
plant all the way up to being growing for
[SPEAKER_04]: decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roots got to educate the fruits and
what we're going to want to talk about on
[SPEAKER_04]: high level science is not going to be what
the new people want to learn about,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you got to kind of start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm excited about the new people
personally, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always said it when the industry was
kind of pre-industry, when it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition and everyone kind of out for
themselves and they were just in their
[SPEAKER_03]: little grows and they were just paying
their mortgage and their car payments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was what it was, but I would just
say that it wasn't the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some incredible people in there,
but some really great people were kept
[SPEAKER_03]: from entering into the industry because of
fear of losing their safety and their
[SPEAKER_03]: livelihood and their families and all of
these other things that some of us were
[SPEAKER_03]: just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to, I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the others were kind of like now
with the ability to come in safely.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, right off the bat,
what we're seeing, which is wonderful is a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge influx of women into our industry and
not, and not because they're women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't give someone something just
because of their genitalia, but I see
[SPEAKER_03]: great women coming in, not because they're
women, but because they're now ready to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're re they're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got something to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a ton of them coming into
the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's, that's put a, that's put a
big smile on my face because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: generally women are naturally better at
things like nurturing and caring and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to show nurturing and compassion
to our soils, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_06]: That yin and yang, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying that the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: So industry day panel and Lyft and Edmund
and Calgary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd say over 50% of the people on the
panel were women and just amazing
[SPEAKER_09]: education coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to say over the, all the events
I've done over the years, these last ones
[SPEAKER_09]: were all new people.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all professionals all coming out of
Harvard, coming out of colleges,
[SPEAKER_09]: like really, really have been waiting for
their chance to come into this industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was really actually rewarding to
hear the doctors and the specialists and
[SPEAKER_09]: the scientists and even these new testing
machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at yesterday that works off
a light.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, it's called shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a complete test.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this little machine is, they're doing
complete tests.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're testing all these new little like,
I would say industry game changers are
[SPEAKER_09]: coming to play right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these little machines are going to be
game changers for these micro growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can actually have these machines
sitting in their facilities where they
[SPEAKER_09]: will start testing the different TC TCA
to, you know, CBD getting into the heavy
[SPEAKER_09]: metals and the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_06]: SSI testing and stuff like that each PLC
machines that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but this is not going to replace it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called complete test and it's
actually by floral tech.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually got a chance to look at
this machine yesterday behind closed doors
[SPEAKER_09]: with Remo and they actually did some
testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was pretty impressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not replacing an HPLC or GC,
but it's able to allow someone,
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't have to have any standards to
calibrate this machine, which is pretty,
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, wow, this for me is just a
difference in night and day, but this is
[SPEAKER_09]: what's coming to the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just, I was like so excited to
even just kind of look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll hear more about it in the future,
but even to little, little grinding
[SPEAKER_09]: machines that test the humidity levels
that test the different cannabinoid levels
[SPEAKER_09]: for patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was another machine I saw and it
collects the data onto an app where
[SPEAKER_09]: actually they start seeing how much
they're using every day, how much,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, what strains they're using so
they can actually start tracking to see
[SPEAKER_09]: what's helping them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all these new little things,
this is coming out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned about this over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like, it's exciting to see what's
actually happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually getting this, you know,
this research we've actually been all
[SPEAKER_09]: wanting for years for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, there's younger minds coming
in like you to your point for me being in
[SPEAKER_06]: now I'm in, we're in mass Massachusetts
now we have Harvard, we have Tufts,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have all these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have guys coming from Yukon cannabis,
you know, quilt cultivation program coming
[SPEAKER_06]: to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really amazing to see the,
the excitement and some of the skill level
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of plant sciences is pretty
inspiring because if you can, they have
[SPEAKER_06]: the passion, you know, it's, it's a
potent, it's a potent combo, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need Darren to say bon rep right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big fatty you got going on
there, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmer's got to rip the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer's got to rip the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just got accustomed to doing the two
or three grammars a couple of times a day,
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than stopping and hitting on these
small ones, which is kind of how I used to
[SPEAKER_07]: roll, but it's going to be more creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right before I stopped smoking joints
completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking three to four gram joints
and I was smoking, I was smoking a good
[SPEAKER_03]: five or six of them a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a little out of hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was definitely living in a cloud of
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the first things my wife
noticed when I started smoking hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: she was just like, wow, like, holy shit,
we were living in a house fire buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had like, I had three pounds of
roaches when I stopped smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: three pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got garbage bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like in my freezer, I just give
them away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I go downtown and give out little Ziploc
baggies to roaches to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: people that are homeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ziplocs?
[SPEAKER_03]: I only put my roaches in glass jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the pathetic thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to love my roaches.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're my favorite thing, but then they
just started like building up and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of like start.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I got a good roach story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going through, you know,
it's like, it's late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I probably shouldn't have gone and
eaten mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And picked up cannabis on this particular
day, but I was pretty high on mushrooms
[SPEAKER_03]: and had some cannabis with me and ended up
getting into a, into a roadblock and got
[SPEAKER_03]: into some trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my, it was my case actually with
the compassion club got caught with 16 and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half pounds and some cash and ended up
in jail for the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to jail and I was all bummed
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, fuck, they took all that
beautiful organic weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you the jail smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time a new cop walked in,
they'd be like, holy shit, Barry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was so stinky cause they opened it
all and waited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got, I got out the next morning
at about 10 30, 10 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, they gave me all my stuff
back and put me in my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I was driving home, this is when I
still smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey, I wonder, I was driving
my wife's Jetta and I opened the ashtray
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just packed full of roaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grabbed the biggest fattest one I can
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I light that up and I'll never forget
driving up the sea to sky highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lit it up and I exhaled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it's the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the silver lining of the
cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it was just like,
it's the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just got all my weed and cash taken
away from me and thrown in jail for the
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I'm, I'm enjoying this haze
joint right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I felt like it was a gift from the
police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they just were like, we'll just leave
them as roaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's a true, true roach story.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the last roaches I ever smoked
actually, but it was the haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the haze, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you that don't know,
I love the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is actually my son's middle name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big fondness for the haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there a tipping point where you were
just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a tipping point because
what happened was in 1998, I tried water
[SPEAKER_03]: hash bags for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had tried them a couple of times and
I was like, this is bunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing good about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Breeder Steve was like,
Hey, try some of the shishkeberry I just
[SPEAKER_03]: cut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really beautiful trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I ran the trim through these bags
that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were isolator bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually got something of,
like I got a glimpse of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so within months I had my own bags,
bubble bags existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started running all these different
people's material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I started running Renee and it
was like, all of the terpenes were
[SPEAKER_03]: preserved from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, a tiny little piece of the hash smelt
like a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so over, like just flavorful
to the max.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that's really what destroyed
joints for me because I started smoking it
[SPEAKER_03]: like not even realizing I wasn't rolling
joints anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was smoking it and smoking it and
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, after about two years of smoking it
every single day, because I was blessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine had a hundred light grow
and he would just give me the trim every
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just gave me these huge giant bags of
Renee trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I went back to burn a joint,
you know, when I was finally like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I should just try a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with me?
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like smoking wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just burnt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tasted burnt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, I, I kind of was bummed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely didn't think like I'm better
than joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of felt like, Whoa, like I ruined
joints for myself, like fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just even when I smell them in the air,
I'm like, that does not smell good to me
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to like some full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just want full melt of all the
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all prefer different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joints will always have their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people will always love solvent
extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people will love their isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people will like their distillates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are going to like their
traditional hashes, regardless of how they
[SPEAKER_03]: were made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never have it any other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God that we all love things a little
bit differently about this plant and that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all not just the same robotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is what's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone agrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no agreeance when it comes to
what's the best with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the term the best is so
ridiculous when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way too subjective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is the best, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel the same way though, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I still do burn herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not only if someone has it
around, you know, I really, it's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, not even when Remo passes me a giant
fatty on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know when I say no, 10,000 people
are going to troll me for being like
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking bubble man thinks he's better than
Remo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just smoke that fucking joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You little douchebag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like all these wonderful YouTube
comments I get, and then poor Remo,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's like, Oh dude, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, dude, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you should never apologize for
someone else being a douchebag on the
[SPEAKER_03]: internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should always offer me the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, when I sit with Remo,
when he smokes a single joint,
[SPEAKER_03]: he'll offer it to me like 19 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want this though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he, you know, he can't wrap his
head around it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Said Morpheus wants to say hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's sitting on my lighter and my hash and
eating my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got to go feed him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: More, more on soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Joshua popping in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the big highlights of your,
you know, like what, what's the real like
[SPEAKER_03]: allows people to break in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I kind of feel like this
regenerative, organic, no-till,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the rabbit hole goes really deep with
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, it's complicated,
yet it seems to be somewhat simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just sort of learn the right things
and pay attention to the right things,
[SPEAKER_03]: what would you say at the, at the last one
in Humboldt, there was the real sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: the, the, the gem of the, I think all,
all together, it's really to learn how to
[SPEAKER_07]: use the microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, cause everyone that's
coming to these conferences are tenured
[SPEAKER_07]: growers and they all have like,
like you said, the best weed and they've
[SPEAKER_07]: got their practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I always, I kind of use the
analogy of cooking and baking,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, where a lot of people say they
can cook wonderfully, but I can't bake,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, cause and it's cause when they
open up the recipe, they don't adjust for
[SPEAKER_07]: their environment or their oven or the
humidity and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so some good growers, good growers
usually have figured that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've just kind of, they have that sense
and they understand humidity and
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature and control and how that
affects soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but the real tried and true way is to
use a microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're, you know, making compost
teas and then applying, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: making compost, you're, you're assessing,
you know, which guys are in there and not
[SPEAKER_07]: just kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and that's, you know, we're all
guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we get these recipes,
we do these things, we see results and
[SPEAKER_07]: then we want to make it like this,
this recipe thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't always work that
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting that you would bring
it to the microscope because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: literally, I feel how I was able to learn
so much about cannabis resin and hashes
[SPEAKER_03]: and also share so much of it, because the
microscope getting into those close up
[SPEAKER_03]: images where you're like, Oh, what is that
exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something about, I mean,
we have these senses, they're obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the things that allow us to
discover and to learn in this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seeing sometimes is such a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can read about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can learn about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly you see that thing that
you've been learning about and something I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, with my photography, it was a
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched it happen with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something just went click before,
you know, I released my photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was only a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really had to go like to Amsterdam and
meet like you do mass who took these most
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful, unbelievable trichome photos
that he was taking in the eighties with an
[SPEAKER_03]: electron scan microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But prior to that, before I started doing
my own photography, there really wasn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people like almost none.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking up close photographs of cannabis
resin glands and systolic hairs and the
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was using a camera, not a
microscope, but a macro lens that works
[SPEAKER_03]: very much like a microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting that you would say
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's, I mean, it's just what you start
to get serious about stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to really find out, especially
these bugs, you know, we're relying on
[SPEAKER_07]: bugs, the whole system and what bugs are
there and how do they work?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, same thing when you're looking,
when you're assessing hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've said, you know, I've had sent out
material to folks that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: here's a good mistake I made.
[SPEAKER_07]: I pulled tarp over a hoop and I didn't
have the dust blocking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was getting dust pulled onto the,
onto the heads, you know, every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they did a test run and they sent
me microscope shots.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, look, dude, there's dust in
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and there's all this aggregate
news for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we figured it out and it was,
you know, it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they were able to show me just
like that instead of being like,
[SPEAKER_07]: no, man, something not right here,
you know, that doesn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: The microscope and the rhizosphere,
like what a, what a world for pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could actually visualize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of the things that people
don't really, you know, think about a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: because they can't see it, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, putting, putting a visual for,
for, for us as a species to learn is so
[SPEAKER_08]: much more comprehensive than something
that we can't see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so when you think about the colors and
the images and the world, that is what's
[SPEAKER_08]: happening on that plant's rhizosphere,
which is what he's saying is almost the
[SPEAKER_08]: foundation of sustainable regenerative
agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bringing in that microscope and to
actually see just, just as a weird
[SPEAKER_08]: example, like what a plant parasitic,
a nematodes are like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: like, like those are little worms that not
a lot of cannabis growers know about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're so prevalent in sandy soils
with, with high moisture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to get a microscope and to see like
the beak or the still it of a plant
[SPEAKER_08]: parasitic nematode, like maloid,
a giant that's eating your fine root
[SPEAKER_08]: hairs, which are the, the, the,
the, where all that cannabis trichome and
[SPEAKER_08]: resin production really stems from that
nutrient dense base.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see the world, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are studying the above ground
with the trichomes, but, but you get that
[SPEAKER_08]: plant in, in, in the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and those, those, those fine root
hairs are what absorbing a lot of your
[SPEAKER_08]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the nematodes eat those guys,
they eat them in abundance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those fine root hairs are just gobbled up
and then the nematodes will actually go
[SPEAKER_08]: inside the root.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where like the disease can go
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and again, with this plant,
you don't see some of those signs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just see low THC production.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see low CBD production.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant isn't as big in biomass because
those, those, those, that world in there
[SPEAKER_08]: is out of balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, and it's restoring it back to
that balance, which is what I think this
[SPEAKER_08]: gentleman's talking about with the
regenerative, sustainable cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: methodologies to actually restore that
with, with his compost teas and getting
[SPEAKER_08]: that microscope out and saying,
Hey man, a good organic farmer uses three
[SPEAKER_08]: to five years worth of heavy amendments in
composting and in teas and in humic acids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and, you know, all these different
natural blends of nutrients that this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant needs to, to outbalance the
beneficial microorganisms on that soil so
[SPEAKER_08]: that the pathogens don't necessarily have
the competency to take over the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: More good guys than bad guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about host plants for beneficials?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys want to talk a little bit
about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to hear what Joshua was going
to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he looked like he was really,
I was going to hop in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hop in on both those, but I was
going to say on that good example.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have root feeding nematodes and you
discover, you look in a microscope,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got these root feeding nematodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to buy beneficial nematodes,
predatory nematodes that are going to eat
[SPEAKER_07]: those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to apply them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you applied them into your,
to your root zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you want to go back and check to
see if it's effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what, you know, one guy that's
actually super boredom, Studdle or
[SPEAKER_07]: granola.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's been on here before.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been able to do some, some,
you know, look at some larger canopy
[SPEAKER_07]: spaces where guys are doing this and
they're not applying evenly, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, they're the beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole crop, you know, they'll have
patches of, of areas that will be
[SPEAKER_07]: successful in patches of areas that aren't
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't get in there with a
microscope and assess all the different
[SPEAKER_07]: areas, you wouldn't be able to confidently
say that you've dealt with the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you'd be kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they have information.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, it's, it's partial
information, but until you actually go in
[SPEAKER_07]: there and do the checks and balances,
the befores and afters, you really are
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of shooting in the dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, about, about the
beneficial or banker plants, that's more
[SPEAKER_07]: for, for the leaf surface, you know,
for beneficial insects that are eating,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the pathogenic insects.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about root zone stuff,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, you know, one of the things I
learned in the Lord of the Roots trilogy,
[SPEAKER_04]: as Jeff Lohmfield likes to call it,
fungal hyphae will actually develop loops
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that can ensnare the plant
pathogenic nematodes, but the beneficial
[SPEAKER_04]: nematodes are too small.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the beneficial nematodes don't actually
get killed by some of the root fungal
[SPEAKER_04]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do see that those in your soil,
you can, you know, do a cover crop mulch
[SPEAKER_04]: and then in that mulch, throw in some
cover crops like crimson clover,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to provide nitrogen,
but also doing things like creeping thyme,
[SPEAKER_04]: creeping rosemary, mint is all going to be
plants that naturally exude terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: both in their leaf surface, but also in
the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fungal hyphae will actually move
those monocyclic and bicyclic terpenoids
[SPEAKER_04]: around in the soil to your cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, you're right on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's necessary to have those in play.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a lot of people don't understand
in using myocardial fungi, which is what
[SPEAKER_07]: he's talking about is the relationship is
a myocardial connection where the fungus
[SPEAKER_07]: is actually harvesting nutrients and
bringing it to the plants and the plants
[SPEAKER_07]: are calling for the nutrients they need at
different times and then they go out and
[SPEAKER_07]: get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point that I was going to make is
it takes 90 days to inoculate a root zone
[SPEAKER_07]: with myocardial fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a synthetic based grower and
you're adding myocardial fungi every time,
[SPEAKER_07]: it actually makes no sense whatsoever at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're a living soil regenerative
grower, you really need to have cover
[SPEAKER_07]: crops to hold those myocardial fungi in
place where they can live while you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing your changeover.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you always want to leave your stocks
and stems from before and then you put new
[SPEAKER_07]: plants in next to it so they can just kind
of move over and you get that benefit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, it's kind of a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so if the viewers are watching or
planting crops into new land, you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: realize if it's going to take two,
three months to get cover crops and
[SPEAKER_04]: myocardial fungi networks established and
you're planting in June or in March,
[SPEAKER_04]: April, May, June, you got two,
three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, March and April are great months
to hit any new planting sites with cover
[SPEAKER_04]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably hitting them with a compost first
or leaf mulch that you can inoculate with
[SPEAKER_04]: a with a fungal tea or bacterial tea and
then incorporating cover crops into that
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf mulch so that it can start growing
the cover crops so that when you actually
[SPEAKER_04]: start planting in May and June,
then we'll actually already have some of
[SPEAKER_04]: that beneficial bacteria network already
built into your new soil beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was actually going to shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's one of the guys we've had work
with us is Dr. Efren.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's our is our as I always mess his last
name.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a micro roots dot com.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what he does is he just assesses
myocardial fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his specialty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what he's done for his whole
career.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone knows him.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Jack Lonevels knows him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Elaine knows him.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all send their stuff to him to get
tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I got introduced to him and he
explained all this to me and explained you
[SPEAKER_07]: know that most of the stuff that's on the
market has very little myocardia in there
[SPEAKER_07]: at all, you know, and you have to use a
special scope to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we were recommending,
sorry, let you let you go and just have a
[SPEAKER_07]: sec.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we were recommending at the
conference is that, you know, before you
[SPEAKER_07]: go and spend a bunch of money on
myocardia, because you only need to
[SPEAKER_07]: inoculate once you send it to Efren to get
tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he would test the viability of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you then you can go and spend,
you know, the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, just to just to plug him because
he just did send me a pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got him and his son that developed
their own thing after like he's been doing
[SPEAKER_07]: this for 40, 50 years, a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So mycorrhizae has been around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mycorrhizae has been around since
Egyptian times, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They've they've they've quantified the the
efficacy of it through sporulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's it's one of those strains
that can take two to three months to
[SPEAKER_08]: really gain a lot of traction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're monocropping, unless you've
established a lot of that that mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_08]: in there, which is in the air,
actually, a lot of times what we see is as
[SPEAKER_08]: mycorrhizae populations increasing just
with soil porosity being increased and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the bulk density being reduced
in that soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a living soil, the respiration
will actually facilitate more mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_08]: from the air and actually colonize the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, we have mycorrhizae in our
lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of those older strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, as far as a simplistic way
to kind of blow Marcus's fucking mind or
[SPEAKER_08]: just a thought that I had.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so think about like an earthworm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was at a bonfire last night with
these really cool guys, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started talking about an earthworm
where you could actually in your farm,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can have like an earthing,
you know, type of experience where you lay
[SPEAKER_08]: down and you just kind of skin touching
the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And allowing that biology to reconnect
with your skin, you know, and then it kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of brings you to a thought of is that
biology touching my skin going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: conducive to my health?
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it make up my human microbiome?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, should I touch a lot of
different soils?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like farmers are usually pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're touching the soil a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's it's that that soil
microorganisms touching the skin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what are the correct microorganisms
for that plant that we've decided to put
[SPEAKER_08]: in there that wasn't naturally supposed to
be in the soil?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we think that maybe our microbes in
our microbiome are coming from our food,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're coming from touching the earth,
they're coming from the air like
[SPEAKER_08]: mycorrhizae does.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're constantly, you know,
regenerating and renewing, depending on
[SPEAKER_08]: where we're going, depending on what we're
touching the actual microbes in our own
body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bodies, much less what's conducive to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we start talking a lot about what
strains are conducive like mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_08]: which, again, has been around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So bacillus subtilis, we have to start
looking at some of the different types of
[SPEAKER_08]: actinomycete strains that are in the soil
that are conducive to to oil production.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rhizobacteria that are going to
actually colonize and sustain and
[SPEAKER_08]: regenerate on that root.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because here's the thing, compost has
approximately 500 colony forming units per
[SPEAKER_08]: gallon of compost tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you create an aerobic humus compost
that's got clay aggregates, it's
[SPEAKER_08]: insoluble, it's got very high nitrate
levels, and it's aerobically produced and
[SPEAKER_08]: you make a compost tea, it's going to have
potentially 500 million colony forming
[SPEAKER_08]: units per gallon, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can put a million gallons of that
in and not necessarily give that plant the
[SPEAKER_08]: strains that are going to regenerate in
the rhizosphere, because think about what
[SPEAKER_08]: compost is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crop residue, it's animal shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you're getting strains that are
coming, they're not rhizobacteria,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not strains that are reproducing
on that root to really increase that
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrient absorption for high bricks,
for high oil production, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to replicate that on an industrial
scale is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a small grow operation, you get these
guys that, like this gentleman,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're focusing on the smaller rower,
we're trying to put that quality into our
[SPEAKER_08]: soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But how are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_08]: By increasing the food sources for the
microbes, by adding the correct amendments
[SPEAKER_08]: and the correct crab meal, or kelp,
or whatever you decide to put in to get
[SPEAKER_08]: that biology going again.
[SPEAKER_08]: On a large scale, especially in hemp
production, like in Canada, where these
[SPEAKER_08]: guys are doing strains that are two or 3%
CBD, what if those guys could get 6% CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: or 7% CBD in industrial strains?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's possible if we correctly
address the biology on an industrial
[SPEAKER_08]: scale, which is what we've done with soil
balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one of the things that we're
really focused on is the population.
[SPEAKER_08]: So taking strains that have naturally
co-evolved with the cannabis plants in
[SPEAKER_08]: nature, and that are in any soils that are
conducive to plant growth, but they're
[SPEAKER_08]: soil microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really feel like those soil
microorganisms, when people are starting
[SPEAKER_08]: to talk about earthing or actually
connecting their skin to the earth and
[SPEAKER_08]: sleeping there at night and feeling healed
by the soil, then it's this thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are those microbes in those
soils?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like grounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it grounding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grounding, earthing, or grounding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that is?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know everything about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know a ton about it either,
but I read an article in this old dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he got into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he literally like, he couldn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like an insomnia thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he got it in his head.
[SPEAKER_03]: He learned about grounding and walking
around in his bare feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he grounded his bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He literally grounded his bed to the earth
and started sleeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's, I'd have to look it up,
but it was kind of the first couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: articles I read were about this particular
guy who was like, he just couldn't say
[SPEAKER_03]: enough about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How important it was to have your bare
foot touching the earth at least.
[SPEAKER_08]: The biology, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fucking hand sanitizing all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I get off long flights, when I was on
tour playing music, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_06]: we'd all do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd take our shoes off and try to just
find grass and dirt and get reconnected to
[SPEAKER_06]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it was just, it threw you so far
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Franti style.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just doesn't even put on shoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could walk a mile in your shoes,
if you could walk a mile in my bare feet,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one of his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I jump in here for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about grounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was learning how to grow
cannabis, I was having to do it indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and went through a long, steep learning
curve about everything from how to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: specific genetics alive and viable over a
period of time to how to grow without
[SPEAKER_00]: having to go to the store and buy a bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like I'd sorted everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty thoroughly and was getting pretty
good results already starting to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting in the Bay area for folk who
were trying to grow indoors and produce
[SPEAKER_00]: quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could tell you asked us to think
about our relationship with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell something was missing in
the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in there, I could just tell
that they weren't happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I meditate and was sitting in there
with the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before going into meditation,
I asked them just point blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran down the whole list of all the
needs, everything from lighting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right kind of water to the right kind of
soil nutrients and microbiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that I knew of to make it
all happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could still tell something was
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a few moments, I got a simple
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are lonely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean lonely?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that plants evolved in
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hooked up to the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth has a natural frequency of its
own, seven cycles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it in every home that's wired
to code.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vibration of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the vibration of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants were sitting on tables in
bags, totally disconnected from the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a length of Romex wire, which is
four strands of copper, and hooked four of
[SPEAKER_00]: them up to a water pipe that I knew was
good to ground and put the other end of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of those four wires into four plants,
four separate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stripped the length of bare wire and
stuck it right into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had three other plants that were the
same exact plant, same exact condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: same everything I could do to make a
verifiable control for the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a week, just like somebody was
saying earlier, they put some microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: in their room and saw a difference in a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a difference in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were half again bigger than
their sisters after a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to take the story to the end,
right around the time they were finishing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a crew from High Times was visiting the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they commented on, what the heck's up
with these four plants that stick out so
[SPEAKER_00]: much from the rest of them in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pointed out the grounding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, what was really
beautiful about it is, and part of why I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to tell the story, is those four
plants were the reason that the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Harlequin got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those four plants were all kinds
of different colors in a sea of green
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that the seven plants that
eventually became known as Harlequin were
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than the other 80-some plants that
were in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But four of those seven had this insane
array of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the name Harlequin came
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about grounding people,
grounding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I think the
regenerative agriculture thing is so
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I try and practice what Joshua's
workshop is about, is finding that
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology on your soil, on your land,
where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because where nature is flourishing where
you live, that's where that microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: is flourishing, on soil that you have
where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I love about this whole line of
thought is the idea that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, if we will listen and if we will
look, it will tell us how to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth that we live upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, eventually, when farmers start
seeing so much success with these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, traditional agriculture will
start exploring what might be available
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things that kind of
rocked my boat a little bit is glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a study was done checking alcoholic
beverages that are available for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did like 15 different beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six different wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all but one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several of these were organic,
quote unquote, wines and beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All but one of them had significant levels
of glyphosate in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, you can't sell cannabis in
the California marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got glyphosate in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe cannabis is going to lead us all
towards a cleaner life and a cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A healing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad to talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hear that story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for sharing that with
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with regards to the connection,
the energetic connection that you put with
[SPEAKER_08]: that copper wiring, which is so important
when you're looking at the different
[SPEAKER_08]: layers of true sustainable, regenerative
ag to understand not only the energetic
[SPEAKER_08]: layers, but the physical layers that we're
working with, those dynamics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so just as a paradigm shift that's
happening right now, there's so much
[SPEAKER_08]: thought and evocation on the energetics
behind the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is really what people,
geomagnetic flux lines, the dipoles,
[SPEAKER_08]: the way that the earth energy works with
all the different dimensions.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then going back to the actual vitality
of that plant, part of it is that
[SPEAKER_08]: energetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the vitality in humans also is our
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we look at the different enzymes and
hormones and acids and chemicals that our
[SPEAKER_08]: own microbiome is producing in our body to
keep us healthy, to keep us mentally
[SPEAKER_08]: intact, to increase our own alkalinity,
pH, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are more cells in a human body than
there are human cells.
[SPEAKER_08]: More microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's more microbes than any
human.
[SPEAKER_04]: The human is actually a super organism
that's essentially an ecosystem of
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of different types of organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of what we're seeing getting
caused by current medical tradition is
[SPEAKER_04]: over prescription of antibiotics which
wipe out a broad spectrum of beneficial
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria as well as the bad bacteria,
which obviously we want to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bad bacteria, but we'd prefer to
out-compete the bad bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anytime people take antibiotics,
they then have to follow that up with the
[SPEAKER_04]: re-inoculation of probiotics that are
going to be able to reestablish that
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial symbiotic relationship within
the human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing happens with humans,
same thing happens with plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the better that we can treat that as a
biodynamic ecosystem, the better you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: end up seeing not only your cannabis
plants flourish, but feeding your berries,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have berries on your farm or fruits
or trees, growing them organically
[SPEAKER_04]: symbiotically with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis terpenes, as they evaporate
off the cannabis, will provide
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-insecticidal properties to the crops
around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a symbiotic relationship in
exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's going to, I hope,
and I'm seeing it a bit, I'm seeing hops
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers and apple farmers and even wheat
farmers rotating hemp into their crops
[SPEAKER_04]: because they think they can get more money
growing industrial hemp than they can
[SPEAKER_04]: growing wheat or corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they can grow it without having to
use the pesticides, even in a rotation
[SPEAKER_04]: where they can do a cover crop and then
hemp for high value and then follow it up
[SPEAKER_04]: with the lower value crop, then you can
get multiple years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then instead of having to apply
pesticides and fungicides and nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: doing cover crops and inoculating the
cover crops with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we will see some positive
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's going to be the
way that we can certainly integrate into
[SPEAKER_04]: the existing systems of agriculture,
but be able to be the tree root within the
[SPEAKER_04]: rock of the foundation of capitalism that
allows it to grow into something better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want our companies to go public and go
into international markets, but at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same time, we want to do that sustainably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, other people will do it more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being able to promote sustainable
agriculture and as well as sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: production, efficient production,
and then zero waste production where every
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the plant gets used is going to
really be able to provide not only the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers more economic gains than they're
seeing in traditional or current
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural markets, but way more benefit
to the soil, to the ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for making the time
and being passionate and intelligent and
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed today's show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only a couple of hours,
but it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the soil information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the conversation in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an important conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think I realized how important
the conversation that we had on here were
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was so in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I stepped back and I looked at it
and I watched it and I didn't engage in it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I just let it kind of dissipate,
I realized that this is a missed
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: These conversations, although they are
happening, Hash Church is a really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really good way to hit seven to 10,000
people every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good amount of people for us to
share this conversation with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously what Joshua was doing with
the conferences is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The face-to-face and the seed swaps and
all of that is super key.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're a part of it too here on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank all of you just for
taking the time and showing up every
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday when it happens and being a part of
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I unfortunately have to bounce here for
11.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys all want to say your
goodbyes, we've got four minutes for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say thanks, Mark,
for calling me in and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_07]: platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I've been watching Hash Church for a
long time and super appreciate the time
[SPEAKER_07]: you put into just having the ongoing
conversation beyond Hash into cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: production and regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I'm going to say goodbye as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go do some greenhousing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to the knowledge drops for sure on
soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's appreciated.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure everybody's going to watch this
episode over and over again like I will
[SPEAKER_09]: when I get off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin and Wade and Johnny B and Dr. Mark,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we're hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to hire hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send out the resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do they send it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably reach out to me just on
social media or just on the chat room here
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be hiring several different
positions over the next over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably I would say about six to ten
people being hired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Likewise, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to I'm going to piggyback you on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for CO2 people to run CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got our solventless labs all
covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you never know if someone's out there
that's looking to go to Massachusetts and
[SPEAKER_06]: process with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for talented individuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to have you on the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just looking for people out there
to be happy and to be successful and to be
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy and to be loving and to be
empathetic and to be compassionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can do that while finding
yourself a great job in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, then win win for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
