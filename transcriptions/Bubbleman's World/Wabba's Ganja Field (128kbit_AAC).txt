[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we are heading our way to
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long you been growing in Orange
Hill?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 20 years, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I saw your plants at the front
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are for the festival tonight,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you grow the plants for the festival
last year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, those were nice, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year I was second in the competition,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I judged it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were there last year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, I judged the competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, I gave King Laia his trophy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never know, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have met you from last year,
then.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one section.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just budding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the cultivar that you're
working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the pheno, the variety?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, these are mostly skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, these are skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up the top, though, it's two different
varieties up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have that one that we take into the
festival, which is a blueberry cross with
[SPEAKER_04]: a push that we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then we have an original one
from here we call the most wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always have that bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a famous trend around here,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one ain't bad, the most wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit that one a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you can walk on this in
your bare feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can run, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can outrun anybody in shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he got his daughter on his fucking
head, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barefoot on the sharpest rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: If she was here now, I'd have to take her
to the plantation, and she would touch
[SPEAKER_04]: every plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's only three years old, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: She loves the weed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything I do, she does, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks just like a fucking mini bee.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see her, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat how our daughters often look
very much like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I see her, I laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks just the same as me,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very smart, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the boys come out looking
like mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You good, Kimbo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that yours down there, too,
or somebody else's?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are straight-haired skunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't grow tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really tiny, but stink.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it could take an ounce of that into a
complete shampoo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: That skunk, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll give them a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine doing this in your bare
feet, Kimbo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be taking him to the hospital after.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd be ripped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These rocks look like they used to be
under the ocean or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystical things go on, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Kimbo, we're reaching home now,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take time off for a little truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out there now, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You smell them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I smell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little plot right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're all right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can barely tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are in it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, planting them nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some nice resin production on these.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it easy, Kimbo.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are about two, three weeks in?
[SPEAKER_04]: To harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three weeks more to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three more weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: To harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they just start budding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bud fast, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what... Every day I come,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bud bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as the next full moon,
then they will be ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great resin production on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice tacoing effect on this little guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we call it the taco when the leaves
fold up like that and get covered in
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a taco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad look.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's curled all the way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're closing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you're telling about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a taco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting structure, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the calyxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how close we can get?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's superb, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gets in close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too strained.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit more purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're getting ready to harvest,
then a lot of them are going to turn
[SPEAKER_04]: purple.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these sections are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that purple right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: More holes to go, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting... So the planting day is
Monday.
What's
[SPEAKER_04]: it going to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as the bud... They're getting
close to the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six, eight weeks, they will start looking
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that strain is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the same strain we have down there
in those pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you, they're going to turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to turn purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to turn purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure you've seen it happen
enough times.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buds are getting low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, there was nothing on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little tiny... Yeah, they're like...
They end up being real thin, and then they
[SPEAKER_04]: just blow up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day I come, they're getting bigger
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, Kimbo?
[SPEAKER_04]: No seed, no, Kimbo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have arrived here at a nice little
beautiful hilltop mountainside ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waba, who is our host, has been growing
for the last 20-plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And immediately, upon pulling into the
field, I saw some really beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, calyx stacked on top of calyx,
very nice bud structure covered in
[SPEAKER_02]: glandular trichome growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, coming into the area,
the smell was just absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just sitting under a beautiful mango
tree right now so I can be in the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we got a couple of nice German
shepherds with us here in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll probably end up going over to
talk to Waba at one point in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: ask him a couple of questions,
how long he's been into the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing here in Orange Hill, and how he
discussed and discovered the good strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's finally got here, because he
really has definitely chosen these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little bit different from what I
see everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see behind me, it's quite a
nice little field here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goes over to the left as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's also got the next door field
under these two trees all plotted out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got, I don't know if that's like a
quarter acre or something, or an eighth of
[SPEAKER_02]: an acre, but the property still goes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this, like two acres, this whole
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think just in the flat area
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: About an acre, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much can be done on an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think, if this whole place
was, you know, this whole acre was full,
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of yield do you think you would
be able to pull out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's full or just what's here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven, 800 pounds, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: About a hundred pound here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And nice herb too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm really amazed at the resin
content on these plants, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just looking great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you should come back here two more
weeks from now, you would see something
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be shining, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to develop more,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll just start making their buds now,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this trainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been growing this
particular one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for five years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You acquired it just through different
people, bag seed, tourists, Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoe seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my brides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what give it that sweet smell
and that fragrance it can stand at this
[SPEAKER_04]: stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a nice tasting flavor weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smoke this weed, man,
it's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine it not being.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin content looks really nice for
the level of budding that it's in right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at my fingers from just touching.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how shiny they are?
Sticky.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're only just getting past four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's like they're going to
be awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about your soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've dug these holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you adding like guanos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you adding any?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what we do here now is just chicken
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken shit and horse shit because we
have horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this soil is rich already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rich soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just needed that nitrogen that the
chicken shit produces, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: More green leaves and nice fat buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely organic, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely organic, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can vibe with it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things how I know as well
is that, you know, generally when I'm in a
[SPEAKER_02]: ganja field, the Jamaicans aren't very
good at hiding the chemicals that they
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll have the cans just sitting on
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell this is a really clean,
clean environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're vegging right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a different strain though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one right from this section.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a part of a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got it and trying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not, I don't know what it's
going to look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a friend I get this from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure is tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're stretching nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know, the sativa is always,
so this whole section.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the original bush weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the size of the tree plants
already going down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stretched.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put this like in June now,
these will go to six feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, tell me about the growth season
here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have two?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have from November to April.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we get them fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not go over two months,
but as soon as April pass, they will go
[SPEAKER_04]: three months because the days are longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get two more hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get 13, 14 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it brings those plants more bigger,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puts them in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't force them into flowering right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of having five or six,
we try to have only three plants because
[SPEAKER_04]: in June, this plant would be more than
five feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be covering all this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a meter squared or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take three months instead of
two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just that little extra two and a
half hours of light and change the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been studying weed all my life,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed is me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, as you stand in front
of your friend, or field as a proud ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer, I can tell you from someone that's
been all over the world that you've done a
[SPEAKER_02]: really great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to die first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your crop shows that you love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love putting it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: These boys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just beautiful little plants
covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish there was close to the eight weeks
and then you would see the hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would see the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those look quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was hoping that you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, I'm going to tell him
to put those on my deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't need to bring those all the
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This strain is more fruity.
[SPEAKER_04]: More fruity, it will have a bigger bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it doesn't have the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: The skunk is more a short herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: This more is like the wanted, what we call
the original most wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a popular strain around Orange
Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we get the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely popular because it's the smell
that I equate Orange Hill and Jamaica
[SPEAKER_02]: Negril with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the original most wanted from
Orange Hill, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good weed this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock hard, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to take up a plant yesterday
to take to the.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's quite high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He almost looks like a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that one somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just just keep popping up and growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, OK, let it stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get to five feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite different, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got an enormously thick stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pulling water from your last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even buy it for three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly, you see something like that with
the most wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the genetics where it's coming from,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still smell it and we can still
get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can still taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make that with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really take off the perfume from the plant
and be left with just the medicine that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't taste like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pure perfume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy is a scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, we've got it set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the camera on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here with Waba.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided we'd have a nice little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clouds just came over us, which really
cooled it off nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a bit of a savior for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Waba's just smelling the turps for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blue River Turpines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't eat them, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll wait until we take a little bit of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, smell this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a super tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell the oranges in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tangerines.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get it to smell this way,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the genetics, thanks to DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bred these strains and man,
did they do a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crockett and.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's the first one will be
your honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just make sure I have the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little hat for the bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it smaller here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pull this in too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not quite so tippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this, put it over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a much better thing in life to be
doing than to sit around and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to work hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your experiment and the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find out the good properties that it got,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: To work hard, but to not work hard because
you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it working hard?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an art, you know.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a nice low temp dab here for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hold it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: First dab for Waba in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever in my life, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And blow it out right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't hold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't kick you like, like it might if
you hold it too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the taste on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor my Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked, wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to join you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it didn't get so hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize I could just grab it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hot, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, five hundred eighty five degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: I could never do it that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a very good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste it in the back of your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't even do the turp dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we did the turp dip, it's even crazier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is even more healthy to smoke,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is definitely the way a lot
of people that are going to have a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: with us smoking joints and the burning
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the community of people here in
Jamaica, they're like, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can have this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know about the joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'll be more accepting of this,
even though it looks pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is just a steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a steam pipe is just as
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have a little pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have the nail to punch the
holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the coconut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the tongs made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it's just as much stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same flavor as the bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of weed is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I smell in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: California smell a weed just like that one
strawberry banana from Crockett and DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we got some pink Kush from the West
Coast Concentrates and some Hindu as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as some mextiza.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one's sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what that smells like to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the smell that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that one to me is lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a straight lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I smell in this bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smelled that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how you guys make it so pure,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: With my bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water and ice, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next time I come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to use my weed to see what the
hash look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want to use your weed to see what
the hash look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to photograph your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to hit a little Girl Scout
cookies with a little Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go Girl Scout cookies with lemon
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how greasy that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still stuck in one shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has an amazing taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with all these wonderful
tastes, as you can imagine, is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to get fairly stoned after you hit
five or six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you must feel that one little dab
you took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wouldn't you say, too, that that's
the kind of like inspiration that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: take right before work?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will come, you know, man, and just give
you that amazing power of thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: A concentration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, without.
[SPEAKER_04]: A wider concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: No truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is just behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just focus on what you want to get done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the world off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus on the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's also that the whole vibe
that is upon you from smoking the dab
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this real sort of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all happening from this one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be a good thing to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely like a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like that's what hemp looks
like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smell good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Girl Scout cookies taste so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't be stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't be stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we need to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The denail of the Dabinator and the pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all needed to be here so we could have
this little experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share it with all of you guys on Bubble
Man's World, which is super cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, all that's left to do is take a
couple of nice pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put the macro photos in the video,
and we're going to wrap this up and chill
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the field a little bit longer off
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank you, Abba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless, man, every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: One love.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Power to the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear from the tribe of Judah,
from the past to the present to the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move about to them, you just take them to
school.
