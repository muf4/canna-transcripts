[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here down at the CCHQ on the second
floor of the Vapor Lounge and I'm with
[SPEAKER_07]: Opus 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going excellent, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Opus and I were sitting and talking for
the last little bit and we realized that
[SPEAKER_07]: we could have been filming a little
episode while we were sitting and talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got the motherships ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about the difference
between silicone carbide and quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought maybe a fun little experiment
for you would be to have a rip of the same
[SPEAKER_07]: hash on either surface and tell us what
you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got a bunch of D420K's hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a color from Horatio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a rain check on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little variety in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a mix of different fragrances.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, well we're going to go with the
all-powerful New York City Diesel,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a Soma special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks almost like wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that quick froze?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is dry sifted, not fresh frozen,
not bubble hash, but made with mechanical
[SPEAKER_07]: screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just sifted gently and then cleaned using
a couple different techniques that we talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Darren would have used carding,
static carding, and potentially the two
[SPEAKER_07]: screen gravity trick, which are all things
that I cover on my channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little tricks of the trade for making
hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to start you off with the
quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quartz now takes a little bit more energy
and a little bit more heat to get it up to
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature each time if you're using a
torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys at D and L have done some pretty
good thermodynamics testing on both the
[SPEAKER_07]: different sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just the different ones, but quite a
few from titanium to ceramic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this will be the New York City Diesel
dry sift on the quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't turned it on yet, but watch how
fast we can fix this fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get that back on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get this back on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the units on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the unit is climbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, sometimes you can see when you
have a little bit of a fail with your D
[SPEAKER_07]: nail, like we just did, getting all stoned
prior, you can fix it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to turn on the Dabinator as
well just to make sure both units are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's steps to things and we skip one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's fun to skip steps until you
put the hash in the quartz and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, nothing's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very melty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're already at 429 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the D nail doesn't take very
long to heat up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to get us up to 700.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's usually within two minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the things I really like about
the D nail, the quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it has anything to do with
the quality of the components that he's
[SPEAKER_07]: using, but you can see that it's climbing
somewhat faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one really is getting up there fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: 620, 630.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd say once we get up to 700,
I would just let that heat for just a
[SPEAKER_07]: minute or two and then we'll give you the
dab so you don't get that super slow dab
[SPEAKER_07]: on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll be the quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitting it through the mothership frab
egg, which is also always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the evenness of the mothership due
to these four little points in the glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: It brings the water up completely evenly
throughout the whole pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost feels like the pipe wants to
take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most amazing piece I've ever
hit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had had the opportunity to hit this a
few times and absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh my God, I've never hit any
piece like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've hit some pretty expensive pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually your old store that you had on
commercial drive, your gallery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Legends of Hash bash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that's going back now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Legends of Hash was originally started
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, for the first three years that we
did it, I coincided my Vancouver gallery
[SPEAKER_07]: to do one as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to come to... I was a couple of
those.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are historic.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So New York city diesel on the courts,
slow ripping with Opus 420 at the CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to have the whole floor to
ourselves right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually there's quite a few people in the
room and I'm getting texts from Horatio
[SPEAKER_07]: saying that he's at the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to let Opus tell you guys
about a little bit about that hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to go grab Horatio real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, first of all, I got to say that
it's quite different than hitting off the
[SPEAKER_02]: titanium nail, which is usually what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a highly educated nail and heat it
up with a butane torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you, this is considerably
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely smooth and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm not sure if that's just due to the
fact that the quality of what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking here, this dry sip, this wonderful
diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that taste unbelievable?
[SPEAKER_07]: The pipe will literally taste like that
now for the next 10 rips, no matter what
[SPEAKER_07]: we put through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously, but again, I've spoken
this mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is an incredible thing to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another mothership.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another mothership, a straight
fab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of blowing it out into an egg,
it's just a straight and this one has the
[SPEAKER_07]: silicon carbide nail with the drop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's almost as fun to watch as it
is to actually hit out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the evenness of the bubble action is
just perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pipe that deserves to be clean
always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think any good piece of glass deserves
to be clean always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing kind of worse than,
and I'm terrible for letting my pipes get
[SPEAKER_02]: grunged up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have people comment all the time,
they're like, man, that guy smokes so much
[SPEAKER_07]: out of his pipes and they always seem to
be clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you clean them with?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite cleaners to this day is
Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Grunge Off is a product that's been
kind of... Is that an automotive product?
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is in a sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find it at Home Depot and it's not
called Grunge Off, but it's some sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: an...
[SPEAKER_07]: An orange?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from the soya bean.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an enzyme or something and it makes
this real, a soap that feels like that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can't get off your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes this weird kind of... So if you
soak engine grease, any sort of grease,
[SPEAKER_07]: it just peels this stuff away and
overnight you could soak a bong in Grunge
[SPEAKER_07]: Off, pour the Grunge Off out, rinse the
pipe with hot water and it's clean even
[SPEAKER_07]: from salt residue and little hard water
marks that it leaves on the glass
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the interesting thing is you can reuse
it over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even once it's black and nasty and there's
chunks falling out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like the Purple Power and those other
glass cleaners.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean Purple Power is an ISO with sort of
like a rock salt mixture in it and then
[SPEAKER_07]: they've added color.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little bit different in the
sense that it's an oil, it's not a solvent
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it really is reusable beyond...
Well I was just pointing at reusable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reusable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I was merely pointing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I mean I use Grunge Off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also use alcohol, isopropanol 99%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dislike using it as much as Grunge Off
because I can reuse it over and over
[SPEAKER_07]: again, the alcohol, as I reuse it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find if I use dirty alcohol,
it just sort of coats the pipe and it's
sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like you reusing that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have reused it to soak a nasty
piece in a small bowl or something that
[SPEAKER_02]: has been let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll soak that in used stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'll give it another clean later
and refresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I basically soak in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, soak it in the old crap is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even a drop down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something that's hard to get clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one has, this is a really cool
little carb cap and I'd suggest that you
[SPEAKER_07]: use it yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to go on top of the silicon.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little hole in the top that you
can carb actually right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'll see when you're hitting
the pipe with it on there that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: seal it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more you can seal it, the better rip
you'll get.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean constrict it completely on home
so you're just like... And you'll really
[SPEAKER_07]: get the rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the silicon carbide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same hash, not giving it monster rips,
just a nice little taste test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, slow and steady is going to
win this race.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, move that around and you'll kind of,
eventually it goes click and it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite an interesting feeling how well
this iDAB carb cap fits onto the silicon
[SPEAKER_07]: carbide bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally at one point just constricts so
perfectly that you can't even hear the
[SPEAKER_07]: pipe barely bubbling right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Opus 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not his first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to go visit Opus on the island and
he had just this beautiful grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was always really well known for his
Burmese fucking incredible or just
[SPEAKER_07]: Burmese.
[SPEAKER_07]: Burmese.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so good, such awesome strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had some specialness to it for sure,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was a beautiful feno.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and myself and two of my buddies that I
grew with on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three of us kept that strain going
for, I think it was like 11 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she produced and really was pleased a
lot of people were pretty happy with that
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually Michelle Rainey's second
most favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to her bull rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next to the bull rider, which you know you
got to give some props to Jeff,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also to Raz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now a lot of people don't know about Raz,
but Raz was actually with Michelle before
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Raz and Jeff were really good friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you know when a woman gets in
between you can have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem there, which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Raz made a point on getting Jeff the
bull rider from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was very crucial in getting that
because he knew the guys in San Diego
[SPEAKER_07]: really well and he was able to get that
cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff took that cut and then crossed it
with the Afghani and came up with the bull
[SPEAKER_07]: rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Afghan bull rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which he gave, you know, a lot of people
talked about Jeff saying he wasn't sharing
[SPEAKER_07]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked Jeff one time for that strain and
he gave it to me within 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to Jeff Tech for kicking down a
strain that seemingly people were saying
[SPEAKER_07]: was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_07]: It always lets you know when someone
really wants you to have a strain or they
[SPEAKER_07]: don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you ask them for it and you have it
12 hours later.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one has ever given me a cut that fast
in my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So props to Jeff Tech as well and of
course RIP Michelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think about you daily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gone but never forgotten.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we were upstairs because there's a
big beautiful picture of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll show it over this video while we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how did you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This definitely hits, well first of all
the unit hits quite differently than the
[SPEAKER_02]: A.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that card cap is, that's something
that is to be experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You had an amazing hit too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching it like, the bum's not
making any sound right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I slowed that one down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was like, okay, I'm a champion bog
hater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a pipe all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a regular pipe smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm used to smoking a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand the whole point of
controlling your toke and not like all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't, you know, people are always
like taking a toke off the pipe and like
[SPEAKER_02]: choking on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, no, no, you can't smoke it like a
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to take an easy pull, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, I got to wonder why they're
coughing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're packing nugs in there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice to go slow with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I haven't done, I remember when I
first met Marbleslinger, he was like all
[SPEAKER_07]: East coast guy putting the big buds in the
bowl and he just couldn't wrap his head
[SPEAKER_07]: around that I couldn't wrap my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, I was already getting
into at that point really being a full
[SPEAKER_07]: blown hashish guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well actually when I got into the
bubble bags doing water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was actually making the bubble with
the Burmese and also with some island
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet skunk that I was growing up and I
had to actually make a rule that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't smoke the 73 micron bubble before
five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, because I had this,
this double bubbler pipe and I would be
[SPEAKER_02]: like across town and be like, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I have to go home and smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Joneson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go home and have another hit of
bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, on that note, I hope you guys
watching right now are going to hit a hit
[SPEAKER_07]: of bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do one more round and then
who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I might be on Opus's show on Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where, and they can check that out on pot
TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pot TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here on this second floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your own YouTube channel as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a YouTube channel and you can go
watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two YouTube channels and
unfortunately you're both the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, give them one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Nick Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: M-I-K-M-A-N-N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was previously Opus 420, but they made
me change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was all that issues with the Google
and you know, real names and various
[SPEAKER_02]: problems like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I already had 900 followers on
the one channel, I had set up another and
[SPEAKER_02]: then so it kind of, it was confusing,
but it's the one where you'll see a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture of me and it's a closeup,
straight on head shot and where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: actually split in half and one side of me
is me and the other half and I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: like doing my impression of Heisenberg
from Breaking Bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, Heisenberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all done our impression of
Heisenberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my good friend Chris Goodwood
actually cropped that picture in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the picture of the actor there,
Cranston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Cranston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, look at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly enough, I look just like him
in the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the picture actually just is like,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of funny.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how you know you're on the
right YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally, that just broke in my hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still gonna work.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mildly disappointed, but still ready for a
dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about like it better as a stubby?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it didn't take off a functional
piece really.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was the Goji Oji and that was
completely a different taste profile from
[SPEAKER_07]: what we just finished hitting the New York
City Diesel there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you feel like having a rip on either of
these nails, by all means let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will dab you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think, to be honest with you,
I make this one a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gentle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gentle does it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like the He-Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: The He-Man snapping of the... Well,
luckily it broke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It broke pretty blunt too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: By far the quietest bong I've ever ripped
in my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty funny once you get this thing
on at the right... It's like my cat
[SPEAKER_02]: purring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely delicious and smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to tell you, that's as smooth as
15-year-old whiskey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, shout out to D420K for the great dry
sift and your grow team there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chilling it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Representing here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna continue on guys, but we'll
see you guys soon on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now with Horatio and Matt,
the great gardener's in the house for a
[SPEAKER_07]: short time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just took a rip of your Warlock.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was the 90 to 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely proper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: The barb looks even more ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: That barb is always ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's the 73.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I didn't even realize Horatio
also had ridiculousness out on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty good color right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Death Bubba without the seven
star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is some MK Ultra seven star.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you said was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the ones we smelt that I
can't remember if that one's Grandma or
[SPEAKER_05]: that one's Carrot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this one greased up at one point?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fun thing about these is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that has terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I seal it, then I freeze it for a week
and then pretty much I open it when I get
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never really know the consistency
week to week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at this one, this has gotten
more of a cakey, less ooey gooey to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This stuff was like sand.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I took it out of the freezer this
morning, I just poured it into these jars
[SPEAKER_06]: and now... It looks like just pure brown
sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's some rocked up sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm most eager to taste this barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so nice in the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I just pulled a single head
into each eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't wait to share all these in
spannibus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you're gonna be walking around and
you'll be barbequahs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put that post on last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, hey, if you see me in
spannibus, ask me for a toast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single post is like, I will ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you better ask him when you see him
in spannibus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope to be there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a trip to Jamaica right before,
but I'm not one to back away from a
[SPEAKER_07]: Barcelona trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the venues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm definitely gonna try to be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Best show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably go over to HQ headquarters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Play some Russian pool with the boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go over to the resin club.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably go to...
[SPEAKER_06]: Strainhunter's club.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strainhunter's club.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are like the three clubs that you'll
see me at, in fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might even do a private night at HQ with
David and Edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure all our good friends will be
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what day that's gonna happen
yet, but we've hinted at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that'll be something that occurs
and we can all get together and dab
[SPEAKER_07]: ourselves silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of the 2D now setting?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, the wood car reminds me of old
school.
[SPEAKER_06]: My parents bought me one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pulled out the wood burning kit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we used to get things like that as
kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wood burning kit and the lawn darts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had all the safe toys as children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barb was spectacular by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That tasted great right off the courts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water hash too, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit something before I go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you leaving right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get going now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta catch a flight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you should hit something on your way
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little Barb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the seven star.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's a five star.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just, you could say regular.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean by five star?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just my regular best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten stars?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't know either.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bazaar Brothers down in California have a
rating system that they rate their full
[SPEAKER_07]: melt hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of created it for their own hash
making, but then they have a little spot
[SPEAKER_07]: where people would come and you could buy
hash and enjoy it at their little spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was based on a star rating and
basically like the superb full full full
[SPEAKER_07]: melt drip right through the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a six.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just came up with the seven star
recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: The seven star is man made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that a title bestowed on you of seven
star status?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is one of those terms that when you've
defined it you have to be able to isolate
[SPEAKER_05]: turps in order to create seven stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's put back turps that would
otherwise be lost in the drying process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's collecting those turps out of
fresh plants and then reconstituting them
[SPEAKER_07]: back into the dry sift at a particular
ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven star.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's attempt at the wet dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited to use the carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: As excited as I am to hit seven star.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: What better way to hit the seven star than
off the carbide.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just mass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bummed that she broke, but she broke so
perfect I can still dab with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than the fact that there's broken
remnants of her on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: My nose is tickling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the actual strain because I did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made it in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh my God, I got nose tickle.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the actual turpene profile of
that MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really want to go back into the
alcohol and the water turps and pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much figure out where in the taste did
that profile go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember you had noticed orange
in the alcohol, but not in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I wonder where that citrus
lies in the final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's pretty much saying I'm only in
this jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's got the hydrosol,
the alcohol turpene, and the water turpene
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you doing a steam distillation?
[SPEAKER_05]: That would turn all of the plant material
into spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: No plant material, just with the wash from
the bubble bags that goes through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially the hydrosol.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think people are trying to collect
it from water.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you try to collect the hydrosol,
the first problem is it's filthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you put in the plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever put the plant into a solution?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'm getting eyes over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going too deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm liking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what it is is you're asking over
here and you're asking over here and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: like, wait a minute, are we talking about
the bubble hash water?
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you could... He's got a flight
to catch.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best we can do is we can clean the
bubble hash water up to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's MKU water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He drinks it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's the alcohol type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So try that or sniff that and sniff the
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a special occasion.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, this one smells... This one sort of
smells like... That's got a cushy smell
[SPEAKER_06]: though.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one smells like you're doing a bubble
hash or something and your water's running
[SPEAKER_06]: through the screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this one smells like that fresh,
like, oh, it's the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you taste this, what is the taste
compared to the smell come off?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: MKU, altar, water, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then compare it to the MKU alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I can't trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm flying, not driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpenes, modulators.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I give it to people to taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't know how much alcohol in
this is, but I can't drink 0.5 booze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, alcohol-free booze I can't
touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I basically, if I take about half of
this and mix it in a whole bottle of soda,
[SPEAKER_05]: then I can drink it and it tastes insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: The up stretch on this is insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: The water turps are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still like tasting strong on my
lips sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the one I'm hoping I possibly
could get back out of the bubble hash
[SPEAKER_05]: water, but the honest truth is I'm not
working with bubble hash water,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I would have to have the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you putting your whole plant
solution into?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a $20 million question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the best way of putting it is,
I am using water to get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just putting a whole plant in
the water, freezing it, putting a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: plant in the water?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I even kind of hinted that that was
the, I'd be leaning in the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, I'm taking advantage of the
water that's in the plant and where it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm using the cold press in it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well no, I'm only going to give so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I can give is, I'm absolutely using
the water that is within the natural
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tag me on my Instagram, at Greg Gardner,
if you think he's using the cold press
[SPEAKER_06]: technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start the discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both like, uh... Could be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting queasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, we need a hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome scene, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it easy, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Safe flight.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will see you when we see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take it easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spain, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Horatio and I are going to continue this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can dab out on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to continue it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, did we hear this straight folks dab
out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright guys, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now at, we're at Ignite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is Riannon and Brandon's place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, basement lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my first time here in the basement
lounge at Ignite, but come check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the cross streets that they're
located on out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: What, are we Abbott and Pender right here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Abbott and Pender?
[SPEAKER_05]: Abbott and Cordova.
[SPEAKER_07]: Abbott and Cordova, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Abbott and Cordova.
[SPEAKER_07]: So come check out Ignite.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got some pretty good glass up
there and a whole bunch of other little
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of glass jars and trinkets and
silicone thingies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, come check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're downstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got this little lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what the rule is to get down
here if you have to have a Compassion Club
[SPEAKER_07]: card or a MMAR license or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure, but it's got some pretty banging
beats on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think when it's not a vapor lounge,
DJ's spinning on the one and two,
[SPEAKER_05]: something pretty fierce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, yeah, pretty chill group of
people hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely come check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to continue our
conversation, which we were in the middle
[SPEAKER_07]: of kind of continuing with Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt was really pressing on Horatio to see
how he does things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course Horatio hasn't finished how he
does things.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in the middle of discovering how he
does things, so it's a little bit hard
[SPEAKER_07]: to...
[SPEAKER_05]: Each week is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, this consistency is nothing like
last week's 7 Star.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting with this week's 7 Star.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the OKU.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so 7 Star, this is dry sift that
Horatio has re-added terpenes that he's
[SPEAKER_07]: extracted from the plant using a
technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the main thing to really
emphasize is from this same material that
[SPEAKER_05]: derived the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously when you imagine some
people have an infinite amount of plant
[SPEAKER_05]: material, they can produce effects that
aren't necessarily, you could say,
[SPEAKER_05]: industrial standard or a process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my real goal has been these turps that
we're looking at right here came from
[SPEAKER_05]: those heads that we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just returned to their source
after it's properly been dried,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is naturally what needs to be done
in order to sit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the MKU oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got to be so careful when
opening a vial like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very priceless in a sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't recreate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very few drops.
[SPEAKER_07]: You certainly don't want to... It's the
perfume.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the pure essence of the plant minus
the phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turpene-licious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to taste that off the silicone
carbide, or did you want to taste it off
[SPEAKER_07]: the...
[SPEAKER_05]: Silicone carbide.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do a real easy method to do
that for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is if the nail comes out.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how I can change these nails in
mid-use, especially with, obviously,
[SPEAKER_07]: if this one had the drop down,
it would be even easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to give a rip on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did this white out, or I'm just kind of
pressing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wondered what the final preserved end
would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do reintroduce what is naturally a
part of the preserve, you have to remove
[SPEAKER_05]: this to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I reintroduce it, what is the end
result?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this basically now a fresh seasonal
only?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we know that turpenes can act as a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a fraction of pure turpentine,
it would be one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be able to know which ones were
which.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because it's a profile of turpenes,
you'd have to get it tested and find out
[SPEAKER_07]: what in here could potentially act to
break down the... Yeah, because this
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely, even in the fact that it
wasn't as, you could say, live resin-like
[SPEAKER_05]: as last week, it definitely seems to make
a different style of cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that may just be the amount of resin
heads left in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure melted out beautifully and took on
the proper look when it hit the nail,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's stuck for a while now.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's boiling.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what really makes the size of this
nail much... I thought it was going to tip
[SPEAKER_07]: you over there, pull you right down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting with the seven star is always
a great way to start an episode with her
[SPEAKER_07]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we're kind of in the middle of
an episode right now, we've already talked
[SPEAKER_07]: to Matt, the great gardener, and we've
talked to Opus 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we're just going to continue on
with a great little session.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got your hydrosols, your water
turpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so now... Yeah, just I'm always...
because these don't go bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this alcohol portion is always factored
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of always... wanted to know if
do you smell any of that portion in the
[SPEAKER_05]: actual on the heads, because this has
always been the most unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if you want, which one did you just
grab?
[SPEAKER_05]: The MKUltra without the turps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had both?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the Bubba King, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Bubba King.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which the last time I had,
this is the first time I had seven star,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was Bubba King.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, Death Bubba, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now here's a pure Bubba King.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice...
[SPEAKER_07]: It's textured, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little gooey and gummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, because I'm in the,
you could say the experimenting arts of
[SPEAKER_05]: preserving, I'm getting to see what the
consequences are on the different heads,
[SPEAKER_05]: the different melts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, kind of... I haven't done much
macro lately just because I've been so
[SPEAKER_05]: busy, but...
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish I could start macroing the
stages of here it is, now I just touched
[SPEAKER_05]: it, here it is after a week, because
typically when I make it, I seal it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I freeze it, and you're usually
out of the country until now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of let it go for a week here in
the freezer to see what that natural
[SPEAKER_05]: process will do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to be leaving the country
again really soon here, head back to
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica, go check out the high...
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting the name each time,
it's Ras Bobby's putting on a cup in
[SPEAKER_07]: Negril, so I'm going to go down there and
judge that and speak on a panel,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we're going to do the
nutraceutical conference in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it should all be good stuff,
I'm looking forward to it, and the soccer
[SPEAKER_07]: match, which I've mentioned three times,
and I'll probably mention it a few more
[SPEAKER_07]: times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted the soccer match poster on my
Facebook page if you want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the Kingston artist versus the
St. Catherine artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other one is the Jamaican
constabulary force versus the Spanish
[SPEAKER_07]: youths.
[SPEAKER_07]: The youths of Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_05]: The youths of Spanish town versus the
Jamaican constabulary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be good soccer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's going to be good man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be pretty, a lot of pride
getting thrown about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is next week's train, it hasn't been
sifted, next week's train.
[SPEAKER_05]: The MKU kind of, it's the first time I've
ever crashed my screens, pretty much is
[SPEAKER_05]: what I'd like to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You finally make, I thought I had
environment under control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I had strains, I had not any
variables, but this MKU is pretty much,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably the closest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never sifted the bar, but I would
imagine it must be a day like this on the
[SPEAKER_05]: races where, yeah, today was my field day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck, 15 degrees Celsius, average room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: No dice.
[SPEAKER_05]: No dice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once I saw it, I saw it and I'm like,
whoa, that's, I can see my hand shape on
[SPEAKER_05]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay, this is going to be some
of my best sift, whenever I get back.
But.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to work in a much colder
environment, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever soft was soft, whatever these,
I've always been able to work the MKU
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty much game changer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, you will see many,
many, many different differences in the
[SPEAKER_07]: resin over years and even decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first started, I was like,
this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon as you think you're awesome,
that's when you're going to get your ass
[SPEAKER_05]: handed to you because someone will say,
well, then sift a bag of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're at, so for instance,
in my case, if someone comes up to me and
[SPEAKER_05]: they, oh, I just learned to this,
I'm like, I got some MKU for you,
pal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what you got going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: These public king, these are soft and I'm
an environmental controls guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This MKU, it is, that's kind of why I'm
wondering now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, is this the equivalent of the
barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had a bad day's race with
the barb when it comes to sifting?
[SPEAKER_07]: The barb, I've got a barb blooming in my
tent right now, as well as a GG one,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Afghani from great gardener.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of those are maybe a week away from
me cutting down and running through the
[SPEAKER_07]: bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not huge plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to have an enormous
amount of resin on them, but I'll get some
[SPEAKER_07]: grams of each one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm darn excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess looking at, um, like I said,
MKU is by far the most difficult I've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: touched.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked at what I thought,
yeah, that's pretty difficult,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My environment can handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My skills can handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My patients can handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other guy is going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But today was my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those things where I'm like,
okay, I didn't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, I did get out, but I didn't like
how I, I couldn't work as fast as I wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't, I wasn't in control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in cadence of the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what, so where,
if I was to smell a bag and anticipate a
[SPEAKER_05]: day's work, could, would you say follow
the turps in my nose to how the profile or
[SPEAKER_05]: would it be by, um, more the genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that if you're going to be
making sift on the regular or even not on
[SPEAKER_07]: the regular here and there, you're just
going to want to understand the importance
[SPEAKER_07]: of controlling the variable that is the
temperature of your room and that warmth
[SPEAKER_07]: is the enemy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when it might not seem that warm to
you, resin reacts very differently to the
[SPEAKER_07]: atmospheric changes like humidity and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can just make it lower the humidity
and lower the temperature, resin suddenly
[SPEAKER_07]: becomes like a dream to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's, that's kind of, you see the
stress of my voice because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I do those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how to make, I control the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of why I like,
like I said, I made it, but I realized,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh my gosh, you're some poor
bastard and it's your foot and you think
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to clean up something and
this is what you come across.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are not, there's, you have to build my
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, um, I kind of wish we started to
kind of develop a list.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually when you hear, oh,
it's here on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, it's your environment,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, okay, this bypassed my
environment and that environment has
[SPEAKER_05]: worked for everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, once people have a larger knowledge
of what's going on, such as like the
[SPEAKER_07]: proton H and these different forms of
testing for different things, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: then, then it'll be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause right now with you literally,
if someone just said, this is a sit off,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, sit for your life and smell the bag
you want to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's kind of why I'm like,
okay, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a rough day.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I smell in this that I can smell
in the bar?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know the bar is hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a fruity tone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a, there's all kinds of minute when
it's a good push, it's a minerally kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of, yeah, I can't, it just, it's like a
mineral, good kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I don't know if it's that push.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been trying to find similarities
where I'm like, I know that fruity taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smell it in the bar, whether it's linear
or whatever it may be that you find it in
[SPEAKER_05]: the testing before we get a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know this is going to happen
because I was lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can push a button.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can get through, but I'd love to know
that's going to happen by smell because I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like there were guys that could do
that on experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of, they could smell the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could just have that sense of what
kind of day's work it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause when I was, um, luckily I can
experience the fresh plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I knew people were having trouble
trimming it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see it in the scissors and I'm
like, okay, it's showing up in the set,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's showing up in the LA show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in this strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can count on that, but that's not a
science to say that shows up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guaranteed someone else could grow that
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if I don't see it and it's a real
clone, that means it's really in the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's cause that's what I'm getting a
sense of.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I've had a few of those where
I'm like, okay, organic versus inorganic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain things turned up the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flesh was the same, but the nutrients
were way different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wow, the one that was on
commercial news, if every description
[SPEAKER_05]: online, that's what it read like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, wow, you really taste like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the Kool-Aid packaging says everyone's
description of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when I tried the organic one,
I was like, wow, this is live.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like the live version.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably had years of experience with
it, but it was my first time today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, yeah, it's not like the kushes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, I'm not a, I'm not a kush
man, but, uh, I'm not either usually like,
[SPEAKER_05]: let me get the eggs off of somebody else's
exhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, was that the barber?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the, what did you reach for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: super tasty hash, obviously from the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always, always good flavors for Mac.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always nice flavors from Horatio working
on different things with Turfium
[SPEAKER_07]: additions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to continue to pop a long
hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might catch up with you guys in a
little bit at another venue, but for now,
[SPEAKER_07]: thanks for watching.
