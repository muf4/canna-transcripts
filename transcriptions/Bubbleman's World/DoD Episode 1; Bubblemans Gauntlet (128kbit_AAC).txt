Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on, world?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Tony Vee.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time since I've done
another Department of Dabs, as I'm calling
[SPEAKER_07]: it now, instead of Dabs over Denver,
because I've moved into Oakland as of last
[SPEAKER_07]: year, and I am sitting here with the
Bazaar brothers, Corpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space.
[SPEAKER_07]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're about to get really into
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like we're about to dip like we've
never dipped before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, you know, we spent about two,
three months working together with Bubble
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, and we finally have his brand
release.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got different categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to put so many products going on
between what he was doing, what you were
[SPEAKER_07]: doing, and what I am doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put it together, and we have three
categories that we put together,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was the black label, the black
label, anything that you see in the black,
[SPEAKER_07]: black label.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a select series, and then there's
a reserve series.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have what's the blue label.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the blue label.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's blue and silver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it came together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to separate it because,
really, the select is kind of hand-trimmed
[SPEAKER_07]: smalls, and then the reserve is reserved
for the nugs, tops of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people don't understand the
difference between hand-trim and nug runs
[SPEAKER_07]: in the full-melt world, but that's what we
wanted to have this show and kind of talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about that, specifically for full-melt and
what that means for the melt, the rating.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people out there probably don't
know where the star rating came from,
[SPEAKER_07]: so we're going to touch on that today,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue label is all the things that I do
with Blue River, and it's the combination
[SPEAKER_07]: of the reserve line and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has kind of been an experimental road
for, I don't know, about eight months,
[SPEAKER_07]: trying different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I finally came up with a 400-milligram
vial, which is 200 milligrams of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 milligrams of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so rich, it takes a little
microdiver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a good way to calculate your dabs,
and it's easy for people that want to use
[SPEAKER_07]: it in vape pens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure, because you can just dip it or
spray it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, same thing with a joint or on a bowl
or using another concentrate in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each one of them, I kind of did
something different.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was Cookies on Cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the Sour D on Sour D.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was one more that was the
Kush Cleaner with the Sour D.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so we got some cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Orange Creamsicle, Cheese Bomb,
Sour Cherry 47, Leroy Cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of full melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to show the difference in
five-star and six-star today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got our screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the mothership set up to do the
melt test, as well as some other kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: rigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we got going on over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a custom Jason Lee piece right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made a... Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of intense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a custom... Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty serious, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's... Yeah, that's honeycomb
blowouts and dichro wiggity-woos,
[SPEAKER_06]: which are... Good God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty heavy, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, check out the marbles on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the first one... I remember when I
first saw this from the Dichroic... What
[SPEAKER_07]: did they call it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dichroic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dichroic, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have to get some close-ups of it later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we're going to go through all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we kind of... You said all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going through all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we worked really hard and long to
get all the different divisions and
[SPEAKER_07]: products and levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got Terp Rosin as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some have one drop, some have two drops.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of want your guys' opinion on
what the flavor's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's different stuff for
different folks here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's different levels, the select
levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still really good, but it's an affordable
line that's priced right, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this what was in the pen I was trying
today earlier, the Red Congo?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: This product, I mean... No, that's another
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on the Red Congo one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was complaining I smoked too much of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked about half of it in two puffs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, we've been hanging out for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a little tour earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually at your place for those
that are watching that might have saw the
[SPEAKER_07]: intro and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a glass blowing studio.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got some turntables set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Saw some pinball machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got some really weird, freaky shit out
here out in the backyard, but it's a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really perfect for all kinds of
gatherings.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys used to do that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had an underground hash bar here
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a members-only type of club,
which Oakland allows for that type of
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the biggest of its kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It started in 2010 when we were a block
away, in a smaller place, and then we
[SPEAKER_05]: moved over here for about three or four
months there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wound up having three different clubs
after the end of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're losing you on the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's already leaning, and we haven't even
started smoking the hash yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to do them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should do one that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: High time is coming up in June 18th.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should do a party.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the idea of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys down for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think I'll be ready?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a dirt bike over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be some water feature.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe sign a waiver before you walk in
this place.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do best here is get high and teach
people how to get high if they don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: already.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I got to give you my love.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing ever change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the wind beneath my wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love me true all season.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's harsh and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the wind beneath my wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love me true all season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while I haven't grown older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, why can't you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no girl beneath my love for
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me for you, you for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yearning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning for your love, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl, I need your love, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing ever change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I find your love, there can be no
excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your love is what I choose, girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me so alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't explain the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you what I mean, girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad now I can hold you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And baby, I'll make you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no game in my love for reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me for you, you for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yearning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning for your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl, I need your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need your love, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing ever change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing ever change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love will never change, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's cold outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the herbs, for more than one reason
I use the herbs, to run whatever season I
[SPEAKER_01]: use the herbs, for medicinal purpose I use
the herbs, to maintain my focus I use the
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs, for more than one reason I use the
herbs, for medicinal purpose I use the
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs, for more than one reason Go do your
research and see I use the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: for more than one reason I use the herbs,
to run whatever season I use the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: for medicinal purpose I use the herbs,
to maintain my focus I use the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: for more than one reason I use the herbs,
to maintain my focus I use the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: for medicinal purpose I use the herbs,
to maintain my focus I use the herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: to run whatever season I use the herbs,

[SPEAKER_06]: I use the herbs, to run whatever season I

[SPEAKER_06]: the herbs, to run whatever season I use
the herbs, for medicinal purpose Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: the orange really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the six-star cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you like hitting the Jason Lee pipe?
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing was incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit it with that little power torch and
a cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a man of few words tonight,
Tony.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think hours of dabbing will do that to a
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Deep dabbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was your favorite thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: You tried the full melt, you tried the
hash rosin, the turf rosin, the butters,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of everything?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I would seriously have to say the
Jack Cleaner Niddy Taps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Sour Kush Cleaner?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Sour Kush Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was ridiculously phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, the six-star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I smoked everything here and then I
just finished with the cheese bomb and I
[SPEAKER_07]: feel warm and fuzzy all over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's after taking these
ninja dabs or these highly turf dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They opened up my chest, it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, I took the cheese bomb
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could still feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like it was still expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there was so much modulation in that
that you're following up with something
[SPEAKER_07]: with a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I feel, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could do that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll only get better at it,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If we practice, if only we practice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do that same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's each hit a reg here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to fill it with some of the Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, we were going to do the triple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do the cookies with the cookies
and cookies on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookies with the cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do triple ninja dabs as I'm
over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't mix them up, though, because we
didn't put names on those, remember?
[SPEAKER_07]: But you could still do triple dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Triple, triple dip ninja.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing cookies on cookies on
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what I'm going to go for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I messed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to use that recycler now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, well, I have a, what about that
shovel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you have a 14 curve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, where's that shovel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a 14 curve thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the shovel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly where it's at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we had a power issue and power
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to load up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's load up this Jason right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your favorite one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I like how these ones,
the ninja dabs, opened up my lungs after
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed like, I don't know if it wasn't
big enough on that or if there was power
[SPEAKER_05]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the thing was flashing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hard time getting a hit off the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to make any one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all tasted like I didn't have any
problem with any of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the end of all this, you're doing
cookies on cookies on cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing a cookies select hash rosin
with a cookies turpoil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies on cookies on cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we have power difficulties,
let's go right to the quartz shovel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get you torched up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to load.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was that cheese?
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a really nice consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really nice consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been open out in the cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leeroy is in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's got the only dab tool too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to actually just pull this out
because I'm putting this into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Presses so well.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say that's the best consistency so
far.
[SPEAKER_07]: The freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never touch freeze dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still in heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gives you like weird powdery
consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super grease.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is more like you can see the
heads individually greased on the glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I'm going to go with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big, this is a big, huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we get this going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have to torch it on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, most people time that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like considered old school
technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that you did the wrist tech?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, you just like felt it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it smells all like cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will definitely do that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost want to eat it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that dough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That full melt though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That cheese bomb full melt though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try one of those cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my inspiration for the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the Pat special.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the select side too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you making that for me or just
yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can take it next.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should all try what we were trying.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you trying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Leeroy, the Leeroy cookies, turprous and
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unreal, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Much better, I think, like that,
just with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like these, the double jar thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to dip it in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not there's anything bad about
that, but it's nice to keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it keeps it like kind of protected.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little incubator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it's very clean and sterile
out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the crazy world, you know, it can get
dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and anything that gets in the glass,
you could always dip your dabber and then
[SPEAKER_07]: take the edge off of that with,
with the.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use that as a dipping jar instead of this
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's all, and I was,
and it's also a way to let it pool and
[SPEAKER_07]: collect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice if you hold it here,
anything with the sides will pool and
[SPEAKER_07]: collect there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just give it like 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drop the last.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think my countdown is?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think my countdown is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, it went pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say 25.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I could take this home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're barking at her pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: 21 seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good way to do it by the hash rosin
that goes with the, the turp oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you go back and forth like that and
it'll last really long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, you know, when you get a,
like I smell, like someone just opened a
[SPEAKER_05]: bag of cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually if the rosin smells like that,
you're like, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when smoke afterwards smells like
that, that says something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is cookies on cookies and cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's called cookies and
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that orange cream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those cookies and cookies on cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a nice little rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from an anonymous guest who
doesn't want to be featured on the show
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the only show.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just do one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One drop to end them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just going to drop it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just drop the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I hope you're, hopefully in
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully none of this we're talking about
comes true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we should do this again,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the whole release thing and.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we had to smoke everything that we
put together.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is everything that you and I and the
team put together, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the, so the farmer, you know,
those are really, it's really a
[SPEAKER_07]: representation of them as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the genetics and the resin speak
for itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: All this is sun resin too, sun grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's intentional.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what Bubble Man wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is like in vineyards, you get
different grapes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different grapes, different regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what makes a good year for
wine?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it has to do with rainfall and
like if it rains heavy one year,
[SPEAKER_05]: the wine will be good the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, when someone says,
oh, that was a great year for this
[SPEAKER_05]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to do generally with the weather

[SPEAKER_05]: So you're telling me that the rain this
year perhaps will be nice next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe since we're in the

[SPEAKER_05]: caught on fire last season, then maybe

[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's blowing it off screen again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Works like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you just saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on like a dating video, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like short walks in the grow room.
I don't know.
