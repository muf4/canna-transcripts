[SPEAKER_03]: the videos, but you may recognize Jake as
well From the out for a rip video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did when we went to And that was so
much fun So much fun, so these guys just
[SPEAKER_03]: popped up out of nowhere and we've decided
a to smoke ourselves into a coma and be
[SPEAKER_03]: Share some genetics so that they can go
home with some some new things to play
[SPEAKER_03]: around with Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like doing that sharing is caring?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have a few pulled aside here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I see the East Coast sour diesel
in the planter over there I've always
[SPEAKER_02]: liked that strain of the citrus II to it
That's the real old school original like
[SPEAKER_03]: just a treat left funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have a jar of that on hand just
to Dry sift would be superior.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible every strain that I've loved
would absolutely be incredible Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we love about them is that
flavors that attract us and the potency
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can purify it.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's interesting I'll tell you when I
usually have them along the line of my
[SPEAKER_03]: balcony here I'll be walking by them and
brushing again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it's amazing how they release
these Odors of just that Jamaican one rub
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those purple stalks on that tall
thin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that one right there Yeah,
I'm telling you that one has one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: nicest smelling stocks Did you like a hit
a dry stuff before we do anything I was
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely yeah While you uh, let me just
get that It's kind of caught on the
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome Yeah, sure love the smell of Good
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's the thing that we love
about it also happens to be the thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: for years and years and years Caught us
into trouble every time I mean even out
[SPEAKER_01]: charcoal would get you in trouble if you
got caught Dude, I'm telling you but it
[SPEAKER_03]: was always the smell I know it was like
the one thing that we love filters came in
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just steady stink the whole
neighborhood I had this one strain called
[SPEAKER_01]: no name.
[SPEAKER_02]: No name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually brand X No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no name was a no name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to carry it around my pocket I love
to smoke so much just right there my shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time like I guess I was like just
loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care if anybody smelled it Roman
therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome That was awesome Duncan
Shane So yeah, we're gonna do this up cut
[SPEAKER_03]: a few strains for you or what sure buddy
let's do this blast Congo mongo right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really curious on that because
I've smoked I was smoked the actual weed
[SPEAKER_02]: or nothing, but The bubble hash I've
smoked of it is just fucking incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: Rue had some bubble hash at that and then
RA coalition event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice clean cut right there That's
a nice clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mind if I put it in your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have put it in your water Darren.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I'll just say I'd strip this
bottom leaf off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say so I would have did the same Yeah,
it'll just cause like mold or problems
[SPEAKER_03]: betcha So we just wrap the bottom the base
Give it that life and then you can put
[SPEAKER_03]: that one inside the one that says Congo
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a name for that actually before
we never had a name for it so we just call
[SPEAKER_03]: it no name Yeah, it was sure it was sure
nice So yeah, I get those real sopping wet
[SPEAKER_03]: dip them in the a couple of congos in the
bag You may wonder how long could clones
[SPEAKER_03]: last like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised Ron my old mentor Ron
Hickey He had a set of clones in his
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge for what must have been a couple of
months And I remember when we took them
[SPEAKER_03]: out you could tell they still looked
exactly the same You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just tell when you pulled them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are gonna root How about a breath of
your air in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't I don't you know I
couldn't say that it wouldn't or would but
[SPEAKER_03]: I just usually close You know have them
somewhat closed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not too much Room and just
yeah, I usually put two in each bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get you a couple of Astro boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir Astro boys Wow that Astro boy has
Get found last time Yeah, that's some
[SPEAKER_02]: clean right there it was Fresh frozen
Astro boy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one that got you most excited
about getting Astro boy if I do so recall
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, what a treat That's a sativa to
mostly isn't it that's the tool it has it
[SPEAKER_03]: has both it has that c99 I find it
dominant in the racy aspect of the high
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's definitely some of that strong
Ortega Apollo 13 in there What a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little cut she is right there,
you know, let's get you another one I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to see them a couple of months
from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you ever be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be stoked Because this is these are
these are some nice things to procure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're gonna be well, they're gonna
be mothered I'm super happy because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be taken care of Everything you're
gonna be they'll be secured.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they'll be secured So those two
were Astro boy Every medical friend that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have will be enjoying this you can see
that one's the Congolese And this one's
[SPEAKER_03]: the Astro boy So, you know, right it's
always good to see with your own eyes you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to go into Astro
[SPEAKER_03]: That Jamaican over here This long crazy
spindly cut is the This is the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_03]: seedling the original seedling
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice Now that is the Jamaican The
lambsbred hybrid Mon Lambsbred Jamaican
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Hill West Moreland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep That is that one here, let's take this
one
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet sweet Jamaican
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited to flower out this
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just a small amount but a dollop
dollop Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was that's three really great
strains right there Astro boy lambsbred
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid from Jamaica itself and the
Congolese now we have over there The East
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast sour diesel if you want to snip a
couple of those top ones Jake you can keep
[SPEAKER_03]: it over there and do your snipping Pass
you the scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to snip it in any way that you
want I'm not really super personal about
[SPEAKER_03]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes D East Coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's sour diesel exactly You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect strip off that boom Great way to
secure some strains these strains will be
[SPEAKER_03]: secure for easily 48 hours like this and
if you put them in a Fridge obviously for
[SPEAKER_03]: much longer And they'll root no problem
You guys root in a power cloner or an air
[SPEAKER_03]: cloner or do you do Rockwell or pox?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I do pox, but right now I'm just
Starting up a new hydroponic tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe how easy the air power
cloners are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like it's Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you take that and put it in a power
cloner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for sure rooting in like six or
seven days I've had them three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I usually like Five to seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But six inches of roots and sometimes
I don't know what it goes something goes
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong and you just want root it won't root
man Yeah, two months ago, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird look in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I sometimes will kill the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to get water perfect temperature
You get the pH of perfect temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: you look on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know the first two times is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean tell me it's yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple of East Coast Sour Diesel's?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty happy about this tray because
this one is one of my favorite flavors of
[SPEAKER_02]: taste from before that I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we got a few of this one up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of nice clones on the bottom
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could potentially top that plant too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to bug that one out don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the bottom ones man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottoms are good clones too buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sense taking that top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know but that's such a small plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once those two branches are gone it's kind
of like maybe I'll just take the top off
[SPEAKER_03]: too and bush it out more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I take the third branch off as
well and the top I could have a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It pints the top and you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinch it a couple more times and it will
grow into eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight up.
Straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left the top part right here so these
two could bust out next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take as much as you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to share genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to get genetics shared with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only thing we have to do is change
the name on that bag I wrote sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah if we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No time to forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show our viewers.

[SPEAKER_01]: It was raining when we left Prince George.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't seen any rain here for
quite some time so it's a good thing it
[SPEAKER_01]: did rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's nice when it happens like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful right into the old thermos and
then into the cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of them genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well hopefully we get to see you guys

[SPEAKER_03]: You waking up early or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Splitting back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well not until 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 11 because we had that appointment
at 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh okay so there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that's reasonable though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your business done quick and in a
day and a half and boom back and just in
[SPEAKER_02]: time to get married.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well it's my birthday this weekend.

[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm glad you guys made it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is definitely a nice treat for me

[SPEAKER_03]: really whatsoever of filming a bubble
man's episode and boom we get to film the
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble man's episode so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: One where we share genetics and hopefully
puff a few more bulls here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the quarter mile drag this weekend

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last good one of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have like a good spot for that
or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we've got a good strip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good strip yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in Manitoba near Gimli which was
a pretty well-known racetrack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I remember being a little kid and going
and watching all the muscle cars just rip
[SPEAKER_03]: up and down the track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved that so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I fell in love with it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just in the process of building one
actually for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: An old 72 Demon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually I'll show you a quick picture of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a 74 Nova hatchback with a 350 LT1
out of a vat in it and it was all pozzied
[SPEAKER_03]: out and racing cams and double-pumper
Harley carburetors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah that's nice dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be kick-ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Jake's car kick-ass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely want to go for a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll certainly take you for a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just building a 400 stroke or two
stroke 452.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be right around 600 horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you think of the insane people
at Dodge releasing the 707 horsepower car
[SPEAKER_03]: that did 10.8 in the quarter mile?
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be paying part of your speed
tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people might die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where I wanted to take you to when
you were out there but I never got to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you're wondering why Jake isn't
hitting the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he medicates eating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't smoke it because it hurts his
lungs too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he eats it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicates every day with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves the candy and the frownies and
the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude there's lots of different ways of
medicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll get you into the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the right sled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the right sled.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the rev.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing will take you in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go in there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was riding it that day actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good drive down and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got out of the rain into the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took the Whistler fucking truck through
this highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so windy I thought I was going to
roll with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is windy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to go slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going 120 it's too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no we weren't going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing like 60 and 70 man.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60, 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole fucking way man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point at the end there my
brakes we looked back.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brakes were just fucking smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole fucking highway was fucking
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a biker in front of us so we
couldn't bang into him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't ride very well either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't pass him because there's
nowhere to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept smelling brakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brakes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went Nate and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you when we got in my truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're still going to smell the brakes
when we get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell it inside the cab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a crazy smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're like I just grinded the metal
off my pads and I can smell it vaporized
[SPEAKER_03]: in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing with new ones he put
on just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're half gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're like I think that might be
caliper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that's a pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not metal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell the same anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put her in second gear and let her
coast down nice and slow then I was the
[SPEAKER_02]: one holding all the traffic up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of the bay is that out there
Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Out in front of us there that's HUD
Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Bowen Island on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way in the background under those orange
mountains if you see that island that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a bit further away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called the Howe Sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go down that way you'll be going to
Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the Sunshine Coast is kind of behind
this tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see it but it's like to the
right of that little island that's called
[SPEAKER_03]: Hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to the right of that a
substantial amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see Gibson is no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah all the lights at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep seeing all these different clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like oh here's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh here's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many more different types you
guys should go take a bunch more over
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking that sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been behind about three times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should grab that Ortega too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's serious business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a sativa?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a heavy indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'll link it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna split.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see these guys again sooner than
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for watching and it's time
to go cut more clones with these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love snacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right we almost forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren D420K was one of the people Bird
wanted to make sure got an Apex pen and
[SPEAKER_03]: bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Bird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the shirt in for the lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the pink Apex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was no XLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hat for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little cardboard piece in there I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I didn't give you the pink one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave you the gold one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be pink in there if you open
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of pink and then a camel
pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: With some of these and a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rolling machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bird really set us up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a charger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy.
USB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll charge that up and be hitting that
on the way home tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm in the while I'm in the
passenger seat of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again Bird for letting me pass on
all the kindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to you guys later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
