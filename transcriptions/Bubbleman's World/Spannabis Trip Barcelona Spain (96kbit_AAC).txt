[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, Bubble Man here in
beautiful Barcelona, Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just heading down to Spanibus for day two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really go yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was so much going on with Masters of
Rasen's judges dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: With my friend Patrick's birthday at the
boutique crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just renting a motorcycle and generally
having a blast and driving around the
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head down to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll film a little bit here and a little
bit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how good this video is going
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I like to film a little bit of the
drive but I'm on a motorcycle and I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: bring a GoPro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to do some interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to get some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 64 entries for the Masters of Rasen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go over those later today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you all 64 entries for the
Masters of Rasen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an incredible competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the Masters of Ceremony at the
Masters of Rasen where they announce the
[SPEAKER_02]: winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll get some of that on film
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just generally looking to have a
really good day today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are ready for some fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Barcelona and we're at the
motorcycle place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually the bike that we're going
to be riding on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're heading over to the Spanibus fair so
we'll just show you the bike real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, on the little BMW GS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex is down there somewhere getting on
his bike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you really soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out this fatty helmet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made it to the Ferra de Cornilla in
the Hospitalet in Barcelona, Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the infamous entrance to the
Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's fucking giving her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get some tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not doing his job worth shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless him.
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not check that out.
That's setting up the gem assert with some
rocking hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Pierce Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my distributor for the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years running.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been coming here,
Big Buddha?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it was La Fiera High Life or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started coming in 2004 and it was La
Fiera High Life before it was Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still look young though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm still very young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, you're old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the street try go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take away the rest of them and consume
the meditation by the CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just came up to me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the Attitude Seed Bank with Rare
Dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did you say to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized you and I wanted to say thank
you for the bubble bags because I realized
[SPEAKER_03]: them the first time on the International
Cannographic video.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2004?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you saw the bubble bags in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in Jamaica, but on the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bubbling in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a big garbage can and bricks of ice
and a wooden stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I carried that ice on my head with Wally
Duck into the jungle.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Stefan.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear it in your voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for stopping me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're a part of Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Hash Church a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're on the very channel that Hash
Church is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Stefan.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stefan's hitting his first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 14 from the Masters of Rasen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Rare Dankness skunk in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most often at Dave Watson's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I get my skunk on more often
than not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got that skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the flavor on that Stefan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spit it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I never tasted something
like this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not because I'm on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to ask everyone that's
watching this video to please wish Stefan
[SPEAKER_02]: a happy birthday in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm here with my good friend
Scott, Rare Dankness, who doesn't like to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on video, but I swear to God he's
standing next to me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a moonshine man since like 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we met around 99, like on Overgrow
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me a little bit, I mean listen,
you guys obviously don't need an
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cultivars are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget the moonshine haze
staying up all night in Amsterdam smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: out the foam out that you brought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you got going on nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just busy making seeds again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really focusing on our time and bringing
our lives to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, ghost train, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one, not moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost train haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Somali, is that that Somali taxi
driver?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you crossed it with a ghost train?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Somali ghost train.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and then there's the ghost train
haze number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm gone, people will remember the
ghost train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget the ghost train,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that's the volatile organic
compounds as much as it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turkinoline and all these just anxiety
inducing turks that people either love or
[SPEAKER_02]: are terrified of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like me personally, I'm scared of
TACV because it gets me just so freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays people are starting to make
gummies that are TACV heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I can't do the edible stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't do edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, look at all these great cultivars,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia crossed with Neville's wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost OG crossed with Neville's wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangerine haze crossed with rare dankness
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangerine Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Milano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rugburn OG crossed with the Pamela.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy that gives homage to his
partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have been together for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like pretty much the same as Shara and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: 27 years this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Married?
[SPEAKER_01]: Married 27 years, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get married in 95 or 96?
[SPEAKER_02]: 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: February 10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 28 this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not till the end of the year though,
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Commerce City Kush and Rugburn OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you got the fire here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're sold out of Starkiller,
sold out of Scott's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: About to be sold out of Ghost Train.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, I'm telling you, you might be
about to be sold out of Ghost Train.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for spending some time with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunkity skunk, rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you man, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, get out of here.
Get out of here, get out of here.
