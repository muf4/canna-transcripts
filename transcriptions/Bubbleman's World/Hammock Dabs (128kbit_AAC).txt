[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just here in my backyard under the
perugala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking of heading up to the
kayaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of heading up to my
hammocks up here on the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I'd give you guys a little
sort of backyard view of what I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a really beautiful little
garden back here with a little pond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some cannabis plants up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few little ones, Jotakis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some big poppies right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more little smaller poppies and then
a rhododendron in full flower right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty beautiful little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I see a little butterfly in there
feeding away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see him?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of nature going on in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great to get the macro lens out
and check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got this little trail in my
backyard built.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little cobblestone trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, dump a lot of my pots back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might even be the odd plant growing
in here that just never died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the hammocks are up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second you step into the forest,
it's just a little bit of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got cougars, we've got bears,
raccoons, coyotes, the size of large
[SPEAKER_00]: German shepherd dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say the forest is alive back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's hammock number one
[SPEAKER_00]: and a spectacular view of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful view from this hammock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna head up to number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the trail very lightly traversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are up in hammock central.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to trim a little bit of these trees
back because they're really starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a big old cedar tree growing right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the hammock, which I'll welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my little piece of wood for standing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A beautiful view off this particular part
of the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay dokay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hammock life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's nothing like getting your
heart beating a little bit before you jump
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hammock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna set up the tripod somehow some
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to lay the other way and set it
up right here so you guys have the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something along these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a few bowls with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll set that up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my mothership organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do do do do do do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I want to treat this is Horatio seven
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling you if you're gonna chill out in a
hammock you might as well have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: seven star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may notice that I'm dark in this
picture and that the view is bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set it up that way on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you would rather see this view
than this face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick with this way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of planes going by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank the guys at Dabinator for the glass
or the quartz banger from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little LHO as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just make this a Horatio Delbert
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do have some van city extracts
in here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that down just cause it makes a great
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little addition to what is going on
here already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful little zone up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you I've got acreage in the back
here that goes on for miles basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right up to the top of the mountain and
then over to the back portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain before you even approach city
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little water bottle I grabbed from the
Shangri-La Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually no sorry from the Hotel
Krasnodar.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Polsky in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great little water bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little rubber grommet and a nice little
glass water bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you guys but I'm a big
fan of drinking water out of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big plastic fan at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so let's get a little seven star
prepped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course being the turpsift that it
is and this is one of the dangers of using
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is once it ages and potentially butters
out you're in a situation where it really
[SPEAKER_00]: pops off the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do okay here but there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could really just dunk these to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go for a dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right well fab egg is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the great people at High
Integrity Glass Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always props to Flav421 and Ro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many good people to give props to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could literally spend every minute of
every second every second of every minute
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry on my show literally just
thanking all the great people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked me up with you know really nice
quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the method sevens that I'm wearing on
my face right now these are the new HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: X's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the dual glasses that go from
HPS to outdoor sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the shirt that I'm wearing from Jibs
and Kenneth the melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Task Rock the the high high intake or
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly educated the highly educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carb cap and dabber that was a gift from
Soho.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes on and on and on and I just
always want to give props and say thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the kindness and I try to pay it
forward as often as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have your nails ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very small torch and because
it's outside it's not gonna really heat it
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the point of orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll heat it up enough that I can do
a nice old dank of the seven star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank a dunk a dank dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I'll tell you about that seven star.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Horatio is trying to explain that
these terpenes that he's capturing are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that you never even taste because
they're gone from your bud by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: you've dried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very hard thing to wrap your head
around but I'll tell you once you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: rip of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'll put the seven star aside
for a second here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All closed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold it up safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought we'd do a little dab of
the LHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little dab of the LHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight sap as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that sappy pappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but the sound of planes and birds
in the air today I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planes and birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the smallest amount of wind up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to lay my head back and get
the most of this kayak experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still looking forward to that day where we
can come up with a torch that shows us the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the substance that we're
heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we're heating glass or titanium,
ceramic, the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silicon carbide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever source that you're hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to know the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to be able to know for a
fact.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's at 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 550.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have to go to 1000 or 900
and then wait for a certain amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know that the hit is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give this a little clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I love about torching
though is that you can clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean it right clean so it's the
freshest of the fresh hits each time and
[SPEAKER_00]: with a nail inevitably what happens is you
kind of get lazy and you sort of allow
[SPEAKER_00]: that nail to build up and before you know
it you're in a situation where your nail
[SPEAKER_00]: has more buildup than it should have so
quartz is nice like that with the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will let this cool down quite a bit
more than I did with the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find hash hitting it soon after you
torch gives a beautiful hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hot at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil however is quite hot when you hit it
off too hot of a nail so it's good to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well with that said and with that done I
think I'm going to relax and enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: hammock so thanks for watching bubble
man's world and we will catch you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
