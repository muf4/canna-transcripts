[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Wednesday again already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just rolled up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, John never rolls up light.
[SPEAKER_01]: John rolls up heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what'd you bring us today?
[SPEAKER_01]: New stuff!
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what'd you bring us today on the new
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep talking about, like, shades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you wanted some light for your shades
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after going over some things,
we found this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're Nanodomes by Son Blaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually picked these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this entire thing is,
which is so cool, is these reflectors
[SPEAKER_02]: right here that I just picked up for you
that are extra bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put one in yesterday in my own little...
I'll actually show it in a video,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll do pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put one of these in, and the light
was just so much more intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, definitely I want to give you
an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought the four footer with two
shades or the one two footer with one
[SPEAKER_02]: shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to open this up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the little cutting scissors that
I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of gained some little care
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's great about these is you can
just kind of pull this apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to slide this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, this is in shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got these little things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to peel this off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warning for reflective from moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to peel this off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fits right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits right on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It inserts right in.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nanotech T5 reflector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until you see the version that my
buddy Ron did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably five years ago, he wanted his own
kind of this version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he built his own custom one,
which he's promised me one of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got these easy little clips if
you want to mount it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got little hangers that if you
want to mount it in a different way with
[SPEAKER_02]: those same hangers that we have in the
shed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it on top of the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go with both, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll need three domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can do my one dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will do two more domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two right across.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You set it right on the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And away we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, I saw this yesterday right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also brought a little bit of
pro mix with some cocoa fiber that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to just do another remix the way we
did before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already used all that dirt from last
time, but we'll use the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what else did you bring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, well, I flipped on January
2nd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it came down 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do the days on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a look at that
upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to maybe quickly fill up
this tub that I have back here with dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a little bit of moisture so I have
that ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see you guys upstairs when
we set up these cloning trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: John has set up the little one footer with
the clones that I have already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some roots growing in the
background there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got two new tubs here with the
two footer sitting on top sitting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pelican cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: How sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be nice, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how we connect them together and
the lights rain directly on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got clones to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be getting back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you guys later on Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of cars going by, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here in West Vancouver behind the
Lionsgate Bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver is just on the other side of
that bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Stanley Park that is attached
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just figured we'd stop on the way
back from the city for a little puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to join you in a second,
John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I have, as you noticed,
left the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually went to get my laptop
computer, which has caused me some major
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why I haven't uploaded a video
for about three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little one on my phone,
but I haven't been able to upload a good
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the one I uploaded today was what
I would consider less than the versions I
[SPEAKER_01]: had made of it prior that weren't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So corrupted files, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we fixed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our way home, we decided to stop at a
few spots and show you some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful places that you can blaze here
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very nice area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're in actually West Vancouver,
and we've got the Lionsgate Bridge in
[SPEAKER_01]: behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just on a well-known dog path here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the house sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lake by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay attention to the corner of the
screen, I believe you can see a giant ship
[SPEAKER_01]: making its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big giant ship coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to puff to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've stopped here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the baby cakes on the rock here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of nice dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best part is you guys can't even
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just the streams of people
walking by looking at us like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell are those guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that John at Bubble Man from Huff
Wednesdays?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to show them at the
end here is exactly what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're getting started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of the Arians haze
that I cleaned up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to actually get the bong ready
here for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to lower it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit of a wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the little torch, got the baby
cakes, and got lots of cool dogs walking
[SPEAKER_01]: by us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish you guys could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: After this, we're going to head up to the
lookout point on Cypress Mountain that
[SPEAKER_01]: overlooks Vancouver and give you guys a
little bit of a view of Vancouver on a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful day with the house sound and the
Georgia straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got that hair out of there quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe you're going to start
seeing now this boat that is about ready
[SPEAKER_02]: to go underneath the bridge is going to be
like like feet from the from the like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's definitely in the camera right
now as it's going under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to heat you up or load you up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to heat myself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a little load up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are friends for?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there she goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going underneath the bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do my rip here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we've got our creme brulee torch and
we're hitting that baby cakes like it owes
[SPEAKER_01]: us money here on Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice ripper, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could just use this boulder as my
rag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to take a couple more
rips of the Aryan's haze while we sit
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next time the camera switches,
we're going to be overlooking this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful city that's in behind the
bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It died off there just at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it looks like we are skipping the
Cyprus lookout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you there another day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just got the call from the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just happens to be like five minutes
outside of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd hate to miss him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on his way up to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go see him real quick
and hopefully we'll get a puff in with
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So might as well start it off with some of
that Aryan's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aryan's haze.
Sifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear Doman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in the sun, but oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it sure smells great in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shazam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the Cyprus Mountain lookout,
but hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost 450?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still more than I need,
but we all need more than we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_03]: Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We puff on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the Cyprus dome excursion was
all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the whole day was really about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what John came over, brought some
of these domes and some Pro-Mix and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a session here, a session
there, talk about whatever we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the next thing we'll talk about
is the next gen Green Rush financial
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences that are coming to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one in Vancouver there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking out the nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's got some of his My Little Pony and
some of that Astro Boy jarred up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big little pony.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's little about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World and Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had the great gardener here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just split on their way up to
Whistler and we thought we would take a
[SPEAKER_01]: few minutes to blaze some bowls and of
course talk about this conference that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are involved with John.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Green Rush financial conference that's
coming up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: On May 7th.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is put on by NextGen.
[SPEAKER_02]: NextGen, NextGen Metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: NextGeneration is gold and it's a Green
Rush financial conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bring insightful speakers
in to talk more about hemp, industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp, medical marijuana, doctors,
lawyers' perspectives, stockbrokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got people coming from stock hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yourself is going to be speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an advisor, medical marijuana advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Joy Davies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got John Conway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course he's going to be talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be really coming down
talking about the laws and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Kurt Tussaud is on there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kurt Tussaud, of course he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Adriana Herman from the Hemp
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking more about the
benefits and basically what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling it green currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening with the legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening here in Canada with
licensed producers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, what else is happening in
Washington and Colorado?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big new industry that's actually
coming upon us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's becoming legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get more education on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great that we're able to actually
start educating on an international
[SPEAKER_02]: platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show it into the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on May 7th in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: From 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: until 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's an after party.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first of at least several
events, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also be in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of June we'll be in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to move on down to ...
We're going to try and get down to
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington State.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about going into Europe,
to Germany, and actually really being the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaders in these conferences and really
discussing what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a unique time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like the equivalent of
starting the cannabis cup, but for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical, the industrial, the recreational,
for all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just one specific thing pulled out of
the hole, but to cover the whole gamut
[SPEAKER_01]: that once the legality is removed,
really it opens the doors for everything
[SPEAKER_01]: to be focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the medical aspect or the
industrial hemp aspect, but literally
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationals right in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% and that comes even down to 420s
investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan Bronstein is going to be there,
which apparently really people would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to listen to and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be neat to be a part of here in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only speaking for about 10 or 15
minutes, but I'll make good use of my time
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully share some good educational
points on glandular trichome isolation and
[SPEAKER_01]: just the ...
[SPEAKER_01]: the production and synthesis of THC and
cannabinoids inside the glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm really going to try and
sort of focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be leading right out of the gate next
to Harry Barr, of course, the president
[SPEAKER_02]: and the founder of NextGen Metals at first
thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be on first thing in the morning
about 8.15 and it'll be more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient's perspective and of course me
being the new medical advisor to NextGen
[SPEAKER_02]: and what basically I'll be introducing
more of the day and what's happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: previewing some of my actually news
articles and stuff like that have happened
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be really about my patient's
perspective and what I bring to the plate
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I've been doing with NextGen and
actually bringing people like yourself and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us to this really group of people
that really want to talk more about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be cool, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you guys are out and about in
the Vancouver area, definitely come check
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send John or myself an
email, if you're local and you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: business owner, we can offer you a free
pass to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we require is a simple sign up when
you come through the door with your email
[SPEAKER_01]: and company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, yeah, we'll look forward
to, I guess, next Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at this Financial Green Rush
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be at the Financial Green Rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it at the after party, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, no, I think the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the whole day, I'm going to
film a little bit of your speech and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see parts of the whole day beyond
Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually getting a lot of media
coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of big media.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking with CBC, CTV,
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of big media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, definitely from a Puff
Wednesday's perspective, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that's where we're going to be
next Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This hits you off of the head,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deal with enlightenment and spiritual
awakening, you know, as well as just
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
man.
What are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
Peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
We're here.
We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.
We're here.
