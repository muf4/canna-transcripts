[SPEAKER_00]: obviously that this was 13 or 14 years ago
and Not on par with what Dougie's doing in

[SPEAKER_00]: The puff part has just begun We're doing a

[SPEAKER_00]: and what what what's going on not just
chatting so Yeah It's nice to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I saw a thing these Recently one
of the great reasons to go and visit parks
[SPEAKER_00]: There was ten great reasons to go and
visit national parks and you know one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them one of the ones that really sort of
that I connected with was that it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: out your inner child You know,
it brings out your inner child to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic beautiful nature whether you're
hanging out on the ocean or a lake or
[SPEAKER_00]: under a waterfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so inspirational to be able to
be in those environments that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I implore all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have the ability if you
can, you know, go for a hike go hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: park That's a little bit muggy,
you know, it was raining up in Squamish
[SPEAKER_00]: where I Just came from but as you can see
the Sunshine Coast has blue sky right
[SPEAKER_00]: above you can see the clouds have opened
right up that is the Sunshine Coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: they do call it the Sunshine Coast for a
reason they do happen to get quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more Days of sunshine than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi and Derek wood thrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you brother Yes, we're gonna
get down with you next puff you is
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying I'm glad you guys
are enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uh, it's pretty friggin beautiful I
mean on all levels and then there is of
[SPEAKER_00]: course Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the cross where Shannon was I
guess it's just where they ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it when the first highway was was
was taken down so Even when you're in epic
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty, you're still reminded of the
humility of life the fragileness of life
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all here for such a short period of
time even me talking to you I could
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking step off this cliff right now and
crack my head open and be gone forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know treat the people around you
and in your life and the ones that you
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with even strangers as Potentially
positive as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going through things and we've
all got stresses but it makes it easier if
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a little bit of empathy and
compassion for the people in our Immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: surroundings and even those in our
extended surroundings Hey Ron Jones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're welcome most welcome most welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the stars at night Jim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're epic epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they are Oh Spencer,
I'm so sorry to hear bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it happened as well I definitely
wasn't saying it like lightly making fun
[SPEAKER_00]: of it or anything I had a friend jump out
of a tent on acid in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: night and he had forgotten that he had put
his tent right on the edge of a cliff and
[SPEAKER_00]: he dropped Like 50 feet and passed away as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's scary It's scary how fragile life
is, you know We get caught up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day stresses little things I saw
someone I think it was Addison actually
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going through some things right now
Salute salute from Chile in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you grateful for?
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you grateful for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I jokingly I replied great
hash even though not really jokingly
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously I'm grateful for that but not
quite as grateful as You know Todd
[SPEAKER_00]: McCormick was when he was in a wheelchair
and all he wanted to do was be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bathroom and wipe his own ass and
get back up and walk away These are the
[SPEAKER_00]: the the humble lessons of life You know,
Mike Tyson said if you are not humble in
[SPEAKER_00]: this world, this world will dress humility
upon you So I choose to be humble rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than to have it dressed upon me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit scares me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Got a really nice blast from that rosin
hit and it is sunny The Sun came out so
[SPEAKER_00]: strong right after I hit that I wonder if
I'll be able to balance this again without
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking anything sketchy sketchy I think
that's the best I can do Yes, Derek,
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree Awesome Ron, you know,
I'm grateful for the panelists as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do really have to give it out to them
it's it's been a little bit of a difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: road and Dealing with all the different
personalities and trying to keep everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and we've lost a few along the way
but I think for the most part it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool core group and I just I'm
extremely grateful to all of them for
[SPEAKER_00]: spending their time and coming in there's
no side deals or any Payments going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just they're choosing to share
their time with all of you and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting You know the fact that we even
have an audience like Todd said we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: shout at the top of our lungs on the sides
of street corners and To be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: like this sort of technology available and
then have actual people like you guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually want to hear it It's incredible
man Master Scout Master Scout Flower rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: not always hitting flower rosin Horatio
didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stopped sending him the link We
sort of had our own experiences our egos
[SPEAKER_00]: clashed a few too many times and I just
started feeling silly sending him the link
[SPEAKER_00]: we weren't getting along and I have
nothing bad to say about him and I'd hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that he has nothing bad to say about me,
but Hashchurch is bigger than me and
[SPEAKER_00]: Horatio, and so I just wanted to keep Keep
the purity there without any negative
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings because I can honestly say that
the panelists if they're on Hashchurch I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent okay With them and and
I'm comfortable with them, but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's It's just an ego thing really it's a
bummer, but it is what it is and my part
[SPEAKER_00]: is is that I play 50% of it I'm I have an
ego and he has an ego and our ego starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to clash and Yeah, you know it probably
released him to have more time He was
[SPEAKER_00]: always so stressed out about not having
enough time Hey welcome MC West Mike is
[SPEAKER_00]: another person that I would love to see
come into Hashchurch as often as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure he does you know when he
comes in he lays it down and he shares the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and What more can you ask for
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Kyle well you know it's a trip right
because the ego is It's kind of like who
[SPEAKER_00]: your individuality It's your you know it's
your choice, and it's the voice that
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes and directs you it's your little
Motor that runs and so it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an ego I'm sure that probably where
we come from before we are born and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably where we go after we perish Is a
very egoless place where all and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is connected, and it's you know
it's not this unique aspect of life Which
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be fractioned off into this
singularity which is your own uniqueness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is your ego, so I'm down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind it It's good to keep the ego
in check, but I'm definitely not someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that is tries to have no ego because my
ego Is my passion it's the thing that that
[SPEAKER_00]: drives me my driving force yeah,
well we come from the truth, and we go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth and So this experience is kind
of a unique small small experience Where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're outside of that and there might be
other things to explore So many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get back to where we came from
or get to where we're going I'm more
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on being here where I am and just
Exploring that while it while it occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: you know from our limited experience what
we know about it is that it's it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: It's short it's very short so enjoy it
while it's here live life eat well Be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: have empathy and compassion and of course
Enjoy incredible phyto cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: whether for the recreation or the
medicinal or even the preventative All
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects, but definitely all
accessible through cannabis and its resins
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ron exactly oh right on chase do a
fat dab for bubble man I am Pretty stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: to have done this little puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nervous about my phone Falling and
breaking it kind of shifted a second ago
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may come back and do another dab and
have another puff Wednesday part two But
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meantime I feel pretty good with
that knowledge drop short, but sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope yeah that you guys have a wonderful
day and Pretty incredible that since I
[SPEAKER_00]: started this Sun has come out so
beautifully Thanks for sharing your time
