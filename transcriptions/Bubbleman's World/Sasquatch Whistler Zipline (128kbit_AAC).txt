[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here in beautiful Whistler,
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here with my friend Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I have met through Blue River.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike and I also have a few mutual
friends up here in the Whistler-Pemberton
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came by today for some lemon kush
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we proceeded to have a nice little
session with a little bit of rosin that I
[SPEAKER_01]: squeezed out earlier from some older hash
and some really beautiful West Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate rosin that they passed on my
way, some of the Dragon Breath,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you got to taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have that freeze-dried bubble
somewhere around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be out on the table there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, actually, first we have to tell
you, we're on the smallest fucking deck
[SPEAKER_01]: you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so jammed in trying to fit into the
screen that it's actually quite hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally, what would you say,
like 50 feet from the Whistler downhill
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain bike course?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they keep going by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and maybe about 100 feet from the
Whistler gondola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Whistler village is just in behind
us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a little bit of bee footage
later in the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, what I actually wanted to talk
about is the Sasquatch, not Sasquash,
[SPEAKER_01]: resin press, rosin press, but the
Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zip Trek zipline that goes from the
Blackcomb Mountain over to Whistler
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's apparently over two kilometers long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you go upwards of close to 100
kilometers an hour on that bloody thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: flying across the mountainside at 7,000
vertical feet that you cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super stoked and figured maybe we'd hit a
few dabs with you guys while we laugh
[SPEAKER_01]: about the small deck that we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to see it when we were trying to
set up the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knocking this, knocking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torch goes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a pretty good burn on my hand earlier
from that torch, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's torches, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man is not torch friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need D-nails, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna light it up or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna heat this little guy up and
we'll get going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the big shot, so it'll light
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That big shot's losing its flint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have to get on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you guys a little bit of a idea of
where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out on this tiny little deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Whistler downhill mountain
bike course that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: through the trees there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing that West End thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a couple of dabs and then we'll
go hit that zipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have a GoPro, so I should be able
to take you guys across with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, afterwards we'll have
another little dab session and we'll talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the exhilaration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, of course, I went to the
Whistler Gun Club and we did a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of shooting with my son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, didn't get any video of
that, but quite fun, gotta say.
[SPEAKER_01]: For someone that's not really into guns,
I had a pretty good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus weight on that ceramic, maybe two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna slide that torch down there so
we don't get burned again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rocking the burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we going in for the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whistler derbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, how tasty was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gondola going through the trees there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Officially our first day of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really, hey?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could say you were joking,
but you're completely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that Dragon's Beth was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked very delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried this one, but in comparison to the
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's strong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one has a unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dragon's Beth has a really unique
flavor, a little more fruity.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice chirp profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last chirp profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you want to light me up on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old honey pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little brother ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike was just saying how he's,
uh, he's digging that little unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty, pretty nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the quartz one at home,
but it's like the arm and the dial and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like five or $600 and I just can't
bring myself to use it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that is, but the brother
ship one has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'll eventually use my quartz one
as I usually prefer to hit off quartz,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is good already.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got here to Blackcomb Mountain and
about to head up on the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sasquatch zipline track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a bit of a lineup here for people
coming in, but this is the spot to meet at
[SPEAKER_01]: the base of Blackcomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wizard chair on Blackcomb Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stayed on this mountain many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ski and ski out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come onto the wizard chair and it's going
to take us up to solar coaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, which will take us up even
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we're taking a secondary
gondola.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be wrong or a chair lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, just to give you a little
idea of where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for the young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for the young.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just traveled down
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a two kilometer long,
100 plus kilometer zipline that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: about to take off on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I'll give you guys a little
bit of a show to see the people go before
[SPEAKER_01]: me and then it's going to be live and I'm
taking you guys with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, she's getting ready to go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for the end of the night system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that
[SPEAKER_02]: was absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even express to you how ridiculous
that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're coming up to Whistler,
we should definitely consider hitting the
[SPEAKER_02]: zip track Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubbly boo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have since changed my shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zip lining was a little bit sweaty and a
little bit insane, but holy Christ,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, if you guys are coming up
to Whistler, you'd be well off to check
[SPEAKER_01]: out the Sasquatch zip track tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very short in the sense that it
takes, you know, about an hour,
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour and a half of your day to get
there and do the thing, learn and put the
[SPEAKER_01]: harness on and then travel in the van and
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little bit of time,
but the zip line itself is a minute and 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going like a hundred kilometers an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're traveling two kilometers distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable how, uh, how fast it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd end the video as I end
all the bubble man videos, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bond rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the freeze dried bubble hash
here that we're going to have a little rip
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the West coast concentrate
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of freshy, freshy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, why don't we take a nice big dab
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually just sort of starting to
crystallize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it wasn't for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why not?
Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, all in all pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another Whistler day in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epic fun, zip tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different things that you can do
up here from, you know, the lakes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do the floating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do, um, well there's summer skiing
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the trampoline place bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the zip track tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got quads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got side-by-sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's, it's a lot of stuff that's
available to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do it here, of course,
the Mount, the mountain biking,
[SPEAKER_01]: the downhill mountain biking is one of the
big things here, but there's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful skate park and a BMX park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, lots of fun shit to do in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the electric bikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a couple of days ago we toured from D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep into Emerald all the way down to
Creekside and covered quite a,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a variety of kilometers under our
belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting to all these different little
areas and vistas and lookout points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, uh, can't get enough of it with
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watching the mountain bikers finish
their day right here, as I sit next on
[SPEAKER_01]: Whistler mountain, in fact, while the
gondola goes by me and the mountain bikers
[SPEAKER_01]: are flying by at high speeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, reminds me that people celebrate
life in places like Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a celebration of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of dangerous things to do
and you got to pay attention, but at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, it's a beautifully epic
wilderness, a backcountry area environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and people feel really good here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally when they're here, whether
you're living here or vacationing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to be a pretty happy
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too many grumpy, grumpy folks here in
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get people really having a zest for
life, having a celebration for every day
[SPEAKER_01]: and also having people from all over the
world today alone from Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Austria, from Germany, from Scotland,
from the UK, uh, from Indonesia,
[SPEAKER_01]: from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are coming from all over the world
to this beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I think that if you're
watching this video and you're being
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired and you're trying to plan a trip
in the near future, Whistler summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: fall, spring or winter is definitely going
to fare you well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks everybody for watching bubble
man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to finish it off with a nice
freeze dried bubble rip of the rock star
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 micron West coast concentrate for the
win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love
[SPEAKER_00]: me a mothership that I can hold and carb
with one hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching everyone.
Thanks for watching.
Okay.
