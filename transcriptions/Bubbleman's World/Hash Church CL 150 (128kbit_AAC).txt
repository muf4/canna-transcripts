[SPEAKER_19]: Hey everybody, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to episode 150, 150 episodes we're
rocking out here so far on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've got a nice group of people
waiting for us in the room there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Lois Lane and Ontario Hash,
M Dizzles in the house, Butter Waxes,
[SPEAKER_19]: Colin James Clifford, OG Brick 420,
Adam Shaken, Cuban Chronic, Rand Core is
[SPEAKER_19]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Rand Core.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not forgotten about you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not forgotten about those LED
lights.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your patience on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a crazy timing when you sent those
out.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess it is time to send out the
link.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do the link, shall we?
[SPEAKER_19]: See if we're gonna get some people in
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, let's try that out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to send, send, send out the
links.
[SPEAKER_19]: Boom, boom, bam.
[SPEAKER_19]: Johnny B, boom, boom, bam.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mr. Chimera, boom, boom, bam.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, well, I hope everyone's doing
good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seems like a nice quiet, quiet Hash Church
episode today as it's always nice when you
[SPEAKER_19]: send out the links and nobody shows up to
sort of relieve you.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you still have this sort of
uncomfortable all alone in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll figure this out everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got 243 people watching.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, let's just send it out again,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's send it out again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry for that, guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate the fact that you have to watch me
do this, but.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy 50th.
[SPEAKER_19]: Saving the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for showing up, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes it's rough when nobody shows up
and it's me all by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand all too well, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting everybody all set up again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try and try and and I was I was a little
bit worried that the link that I send it
[SPEAKER_19]: to because no one came in.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought maybe I that link is dead or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, no, I had problems with my my
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got this real camera on top and it
just sometimes it has to get its click in
[SPEAKER_03]: on that computer for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took me a minute to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my apologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no worries whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_19]: I honestly am completely not sure if the
it's working for anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, if I got it, it's usually a good
sign.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's a very good sign.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: But at the same time, there's nobody else
in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I would entertain people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the latest International
Association of Cannabinoid Medicines news.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it starts off with the top news is
Poland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they signed a law approving by
Parliament for cannabis based medicines
[SPEAKER_03]: can be purchased at pharmacies by
prescription in Poland that will take
[SPEAKER_03]: effect in three months, it says.
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations, Poland, on getting
yourself medical marijuana looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Below that is cannabis may be helpful in
Parkinson's disease, according to a
[SPEAKER_03]: survey, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finding more people with spasticity
disorders, finding, you know, use of CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: and CB THC together and seems to be
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see going further down cannabis
use in adolescence was not associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: the decline in intelligence in a twin
study study of almost 2000 twins from the
[SPEAKER_03]: US for cannabis use was not associated
with any significant change in
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligence quotient and executive
function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they studied one of the twins while the
other one was left all alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's from the study of from the
Department of Psychology from Arizona
[SPEAKER_03]: State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is any type of twin studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it gives you as best as
understanding to have societal
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of what the dangers
necessarily are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've used twin studies through other,
you know, products throughout the ages and
[SPEAKER_03]: have been able to find, you know,
efficacy or non efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems in this face, they found
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for adolescents because
there's always talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, adolescent cannabis use is
always a concern because mind's
[SPEAKER_03]: developing, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know where the debate
necessarily goes regarding that with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, adolescents, you know,
beneficial effects of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are needed as medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we still have cognitive,
you know, realities that happen that are
[SPEAKER_03]: associated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but there's not no association with
decline in intelligence, which is good,
[SPEAKER_03]: but doesn't mean for emotional stability.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do they often put things together when
something is a neuro generative protector
[SPEAKER_19]: or protectant?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it also simultaneously affecting the
brain when it's developing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of always been the
discussion is the fear of the developing
[SPEAKER_03]: mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of been precaution more than if
there's been science to necessarily lead
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is probably what they
were trying to do at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Psychology there at Arizona
State is probably figure out what the
[SPEAKER_03]: cognitive reason or isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sent them that, you know,
probably they were not happy to find that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it didn't have the type of
effects that they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's science, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, welcome, everyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Chimera.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got Etienne, who always shows up first.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got skunk man Sam showing up as a
little doll in a wicker chair.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to tell the folks out there,
I have developed a new cannabis variety
[SPEAKER_13]: called efficacy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it guaranteed to work on everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, welcome to Wade from the House of
Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for showing up, brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, Dr. Natasha holding it down
as always.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing there, Dr. Natasha?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to unmute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 150th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_19]: 150 episodes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't kind of believe it, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty, pretty incredible that for
150 Sundays in a row, this sort of
[SPEAKER_19]: mechanism, this platform has existed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's well, Bill Hicks once said it's just
a ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a shame that it only took 150
episodes for efficacy to finally get
[SPEAKER_03]: announced from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for finally announcing.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been holding on to that for a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, yeah, I'll just hold on to
this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've copyrighted it and patented it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you talk about it, you owe me checks
in the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm calling it the sesquiterp
centennial today.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that don't know what
sesquiterp means are sesquiterp sesquia
[SPEAKER_04]: means one and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sesquicentennial is one and a half
times 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it versus the mono versus the mono,
which is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody should know at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes terpenes are made from these
chemical units called isoprene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, two isoprenes together is one
mono terp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three together is a sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_13]: So IE1.5.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know any sesquiterpene that you
enjoy and you like the modification and
[SPEAKER_13]: the potentiation of THC, for example,
with that terpene that's a sesquiterpene?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the sesquiterpene are
really, you know, to me, the mono terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: are the nice parts of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the sesquiterpene, I think the most
important one, I think we should probably
[SPEAKER_04]: mention is beta cariophylline because it's
a CB2 receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically, you know, we we've started
to define cannabinoids by what binds to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid receptors more so than,
you know, these unique compounds that are
[SPEAKER_04]: produced by the cannabis plant and some
related species or unrelated species.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beta cariophylline, because it binds
to CB2, it's actually a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the only trouble is very, very
cariophylline does not potentiate or
[SPEAKER_13]: particularly modify THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it does in some some important
medical ways, but not for recreational
[SPEAKER_13]: value in any positive way I could
discover.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I tried really hard.
[SPEAKER_19]: So do you think, Chimera, that the mono
terpenes, obviously the more volatile,
[SPEAKER_19]: the lighter of the terpenes, they seem to
evaporate out or volatize out in a quicker
[SPEAKER_19]: fashion?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you think it's why, you know,
so many people, because for years we got
[SPEAKER_19]: rid of these, we cured these out of our
plants and out of our hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now it seems to be, I don't quite see
people trying to keep them present in
[SPEAKER_19]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: But for extracts, it seems to be very much
the rage that, you know, it's fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_19]: or it's live resin or it's, you know,
taken from the plant, frozen, extracted
[SPEAKER_19]: and inhaled.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you think that's a more positive or a
negative, inhaling the terpenes that we
[SPEAKER_19]: used to cure out of our cultivars?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that, you know, the mono
terpenes generally, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the mono terpenes are really
what gives the best part of the character
[SPEAKER_04]: to these fresh frozen extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of the things that even,
you know, herb has that traditional hashes
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have, you know, because the
traditional hashes, the way they're
[SPEAKER_04]: processed and stored.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that these mono terpenes are
smaller, lighter molecules, they do have a
[SPEAKER_04]: tendency to evaporate off first.
[SPEAKER_13]: Imported traditional hash, I would agree
with you because they're often heated when
[SPEAKER_13]: they're pressed.
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, but if you make dry sift at
home and you save it in your freezer,
[SPEAKER_13]: then I guarantee you that it stays very
potent and pungent, although it won't have
[SPEAKER_13]: as much terpenes as a fresh living plant
or a fresh frozen plant that definitely
[SPEAKER_13]: has more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got to remember too, I mean,
these traditional hashes countries,
[SPEAKER_04]: they grow the cannabis outside,
but they dry it in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do lose a lot of that mono terpene
fraction just because of that whole way of
[SPEAKER_04]: processing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it also makes it more stable so that
when it's shipped and transported,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a stable product rather than over
terpene stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it'll melt down during the
shipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and we, you know, we saw that with
our friend down in Morocco that was
[SPEAKER_04]: producing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_13]: What you want is as terpene rich as you
can possibly get, that's stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've got a trade off between the
realities of the processor versus,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, probably the ideal wants of the
consumer, but I don't think the consumers
[SPEAKER_04]: at the point in time where they really
realize that at this point in time yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think probably as we move forward
into legalization and prohibition ends,
[SPEAKER_04]: that maybe cannabis will be, or at least
the cannabis products that people are
[SPEAKER_04]: consuming will be higher, more mono
terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm definitely, I'm starting by not
even calling myself a processor anymore.
[SPEAKER_19]: I call myself the unveiler of the flame.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you have flame that needs unveiling,
bring it on by, we would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're, you're a flamer is what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm an unveiler of the flame.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't use flame anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I use an email.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm a bailer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Who'd have ever thought the day where Sam
was only dabbing and right.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have high enough quality dry sift,
it works just as good as anything else you
[SPEAKER_13]: dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think he realized that now I think
that Sam realized that the, the trail of
[SPEAKER_04]: batches was, it was a security threat.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was always the stainless steel
screens I was following.
[SPEAKER_19]: One, one and done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I might've left thousands of screens
in my little trails that various cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: get togethers, but I left tens of
thousands of those kitchen wooden matches.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those extra big wooden matches.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember it like the 2001 or 2002 cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when we were standing around smoking
hash and people were, I remember this one
[SPEAKER_04]: guy was going around and just collecting
all the Sam screens because they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: half hits left on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such a, such a weird reality.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it was Sam was the snuffle up
against back then too.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was kind of like, people would be like,
what are all these matches and screens?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, dude, that's stunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_19]: He'd be like, what, where is he?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, follow the trail, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like breadcrumbs, but only different
event was the one in Germany.
[SPEAKER_13]: It might've been, I don't remember what
kind of an event it was, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: allow cannabis smoking at this event.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we did was we found a place where
all of the, uh, the spaces for the,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, uh, vendors, uh, all in this one
particular spot met where there was a
[SPEAKER_13]: blank triangle in between the ball with no
way to get in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we went under the door under the wall
of one of them because they were cloth and
[SPEAKER_13]: we started hanging out in there and we did
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like half of that day we were in there
smoking our brains out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember that specifically.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also, we did the same thing in
Vancouver of just only four or five years
[SPEAKER_19]: ago when Sandra Colasanti, Remo's wife,
threw a, it was like a health show that
[SPEAKER_19]: they did that she was a part of.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we were, there was so no puffing at
all.
[SPEAKER_19]: And my booth backed onto this weird
cryogenic, like you go get in this tank.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it would like cool your whole
body down to this crazy temperature.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I guess at the top of it, it was like
releasing like dry ice smoke.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the thing was like a, like a train,
it was just constantly blowing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I figured out if we go into the back of
my little booth here, we can just get it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was literally from the German event
because that was when Sam says like the
[SPEAKER_19]: half the day, there were people puffing in
there really consistently almost the
[SPEAKER_19]: entire time.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you weren't in there and you were
looking from a distance, watching certain
[SPEAKER_19]: people didn't know to blow their hit down.
[SPEAKER_19]: They would take the rip and then go and
blow it straight up out of the booth,
[SPEAKER_19]: which let me tell you at an event where
there's no smoking, that shit stands out
[SPEAKER_19]: like a sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but we never got it any problem
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, it's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that at Biofoc?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so because they were a
little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannibusiness because do you remember the
next year, Dave, those guys showed up with
[SPEAKER_19]: the giant bus at Cannibusiness and they
were letting people onto the top floor.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had a DJ up there and that became the
puffing area the next year.
[SPEAKER_19]: These, these raver guys showed up with
this huge like two-story bus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Germans enforced no smoking.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to argue.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, they're really good at
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: If they ignore it, then you know,
puff on.
[SPEAKER_19]: They will take your blood.
[SPEAKER_19]: As they said to my friend Richard at the
roadblock, we will take your blood.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: I can remember going to a restaurant with
you one time too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember where it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's somewhere in Germany and everybody
just started puffing there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It might've been part of a Biofac thing,
but, or, or the IACM or the EIHA.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many German bar groups there.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're very much into health and hemp and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I've, you know what, as strict as
Germany is where they will literally take
[SPEAKER_19]: your blood on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_19]: If they suspect that you have drugs in
your bloodstream at the same time,
[SPEAKER_19]: I have been in restaurants in Germany,
really good, nice ones, like four and
[SPEAKER_19]: five-star restaurants where we've been
like, can we puff?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have this apple and they're just like,
yeah, of course, no cash, no problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: What?
[SPEAKER_19]: That would, that would never happen in a
million years in Canada at any five-star
[SPEAKER_19]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could never convince them to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the safest thing to do is to bring a
bunch of friends and rent the whole
[SPEAKER_13]: restaurant for the evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, then if the owner's a happy guy,
you don't got problems.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, speaking of happy guys, how,
how goes the laughter?
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Wade, how goes the laughter?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, we got you muted.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm going to turn on my mic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Things are good.
[SPEAKER_14]: My little garden is flourishing.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Caladrius Network, we're up to 40 some
families at this point.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Forrest is going to join us a
little later.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's working with a family that's come
from out of town this morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, much loveliness going on here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just doing the good work all around.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, it's always good to get yourself
behind something so good that you just
[SPEAKER_19]: know that you're not wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your time is, couldn't be better spent in
fact.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's kind of the way I feel about
both you and Forrest.
[SPEAKER_19]: Every time I hear about what you guys are
doing, helping out families, helping out,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, catastrophically ill children.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's, someone's got to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm glad it's you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a real need.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a miracle to me that this plant
actually kind of provides the relief that
[SPEAKER_14]: it does to some of these kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really dramatic when you actually
experience it in your own life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I've come to realize,
and I think I'm preaching to the choir,
[SPEAKER_14]: so to speak here, but I'm pretty convinced
cannabis really is the healing of the
[SPEAKER_14]: people.
[SPEAKER_14]: That there's something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know that Sam's, what do you call
it, efficacy?
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a lovely thing, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: Please put your check in the mail.
[SPEAKER_13]: I own that copyrighted name.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you say it on national fucking TV like
this, you've got to give me millions.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I owe you, man?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait till the end of the day and I
can send everybody their check.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, their invoice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Their bill, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, it's, personally, my own focus
has really been looking for plants that
[SPEAKER_14]: would benefit specific kids that we're
trying to help.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where different cannabinoids
and different terpenes come into play.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things that I look forward to
learning more about is cold process
[SPEAKER_14]: extractions, where the terpenes are
enhanced.
[SPEAKER_14]: And preserved.
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're finding is that it's not just
the cannabinoid profiles that seem to help
[SPEAKER_14]: these kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have kids that get benefit from high
CBD, virtually no THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: But different versions of that cannabis
plant work much better for some of the
[SPEAKER_14]: kids than for others.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure there's some aspect of the
genetics of the child having something to
[SPEAKER_14]: do with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's also, I believe, and I don't
know, but it's just my sense that terpenes
[SPEAKER_14]: really do play an essential part in
moderating or influencing the effects of
[SPEAKER_14]: the cannabinoids and other compounds that
we may not even know about at this point
[SPEAKER_14]: that have beneficial effects for people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's fascinating to me is that I'm
really becoming increasingly convinced
[SPEAKER_14]: that, sorry for the rant, everybody,
but I'm really convinced that virtually
[SPEAKER_14]: every human being could benefit in some
way from an interaction with these plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every human being.
[SPEAKER_14]: This plant grew for us, evolved for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We evolved to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a whole thing going on with the
endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_14]: phytocannabinoids that are made by the
plant that I think is deep magic,
[SPEAKER_14]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a real relationship there,
and prohibition did its best to try and
[SPEAKER_14]: shut it down.
[SPEAKER_14]: But wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want to thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tony, I guess, was the one who
introduced us.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the opportunity to share with and
learn from all of you is a real blessing
[SPEAKER_14]: in my life and in my work.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's already shaping what's able to happen
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really grateful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And boom, 150 episodes, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you said, every Sunday preaching to
the folk who want to learn.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, even the first photo,
Tony, he took a photo of you guys and he
[SPEAKER_19]: sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, man, those guys look like
awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know anything about you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tony just sent me, he was like,
we're going to be doing lots with these
[SPEAKER_19]: guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, all right, I'll trust
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I had no idea of the level of
awesomeness that you guys were involved
[SPEAKER_19]: in.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I also thank you right back.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, when it comes to the
conversation of terpenes, it's not a huge
[SPEAKER_19]: surprise, even though we're surprised by
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was surprised when Sam first modulated
the effects of THCA for me in his
[SPEAKER_19]: apartment there almost 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: But at the same time, it's interesting
that we would be surprised because it's
[SPEAKER_19]: the smell of the plant that we've always
loved.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the most attracted things that
brings us to this plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, oh, can you smell that?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, you know, the nicest herb that
we ever used to get.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not the nicest, but let's say the rankest,
the stuff that just stunk so badly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a cultivar called rennet here in B
.C.
[SPEAKER_19]: in Canada, for that matter.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was on the East Coast as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I used to call it pot to get you
busted because it was literally if you had
[SPEAKER_19]: it in your car, you were getting busted.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you had it at a hotel room,
you were getting kicked out and busted.
[SPEAKER_19]: And no matter where you had this stuff,
to give you an idea of how stinky it was,
[SPEAKER_19]: I was walking out of my kitchen to my
computer and I would smell it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be like, why do I smell that rennet?
[SPEAKER_19]: I had no rennet left.
[SPEAKER_19]: I ended up finally getting down on my
hands and knees and looking around my
[SPEAKER_19]: bookshelf.
[SPEAKER_19]: And behind my bookshelf, I saw a little
stalk with a part of like a fan leaf,
[SPEAKER_19]: a crystal fan leaf.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was very covered.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't even a bud.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I didn't believe that it was what was
causing the smell.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I crushed it in my finger.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was like this explosion.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was the first cultivar that I ran
through the bubble bags that smelt and
[SPEAKER_19]: tasted as strong as the bud itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: Prior to that, the majority of the
cultivars we ran through bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_19]: there were the shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_19]: There were some other cultivars that came
out nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: But a lot of the cultivars, say the first
10 plus that we threw in there,
[SPEAKER_19]: came out with not an exciting smell,
not an exciting taste, like much like what
[SPEAKER_19]: I would suspect Sam saw with Rob Clark
back in the day when they were
[SPEAKER_19]: experimenting with heavy resins.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't hit the right cultivar with
water extraction, it's just not exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: But for whatever reason, the cold water
and the shorter the time of exposure also
[SPEAKER_13]: helps.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: However, that being said, Renee was
different.
[SPEAKER_19]: Renee could be the driest, like dry,
dry, dry, dry, dry material.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could run it in water hash and
literally leave it in those buckets for
[SPEAKER_19]: three hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you pulled that resin and you
dried that resin, it just absolutely
[SPEAKER_19]: wreaked like a bag of weed more than the
hash itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: I always and it was it could be very
incorrect the way I was saying it,
[SPEAKER_19]: because I've had people who are much
smarter than me on the topic tell me
[SPEAKER_19]: that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_19]: I always kind of was saying, I guess there
are water soluble terpenes and non water
[SPEAKER_19]: soluble terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, because whatever reason
these ones were sticking around after
[SPEAKER_19]: being washed, whereas certain ones seem to
wash out into the water.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason I think that is because I
could smell them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: And see a discoloration.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, terpenes are hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it possible for some to be water
soluble and some to be alcohol soluble?
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I know that some of those terpenes,
the ones that we seek out for water
[SPEAKER_19]: extraction, they they they push right
through water.
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't get pulled out in the water.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's that's something I would have
liked to have seen more science on and
[SPEAKER_19]: more people focusing attention on what's
going on in these particular gland heads.
[SPEAKER_19]: What is it producing that is not washing
away in the water?
[SPEAKER_14]: Just I'd I'd be fascinated to know if is
Renee still around?
[SPEAKER_14]: And is there been test results done on it
that might reveal what's what it is that's
[SPEAKER_14]: so persistent and not and unusual,
not found in other cultivars?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, she's around, but I don't think
she's around in the same way that she used
[SPEAKER_19]: to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, I mean, it could just be that
we don't remember things accurately when
[SPEAKER_19]: we're younger.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we always have those stories.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so much better back then.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was you just have it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's they don't have anything like this
anymore.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, well, I don't really believe
that either.
[SPEAKER_19]: To me, Renee was like some crazy tweaked
out like it was a skunk number one that
[SPEAKER_19]: got hit with something.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's that's just what I you know,
from from smoking Sam's resin and being
[SPEAKER_19]: exposed to skunk number one, the fruity
version from Holland over the years.
[SPEAKER_19]: I I just think and then the cheese when
the cheese came out, I was like,
[SPEAKER_19]: this is like some weird Renee it's like
it's it's it left the Renee is unique in
[SPEAKER_19]: the sense that it's very fruity and skunk
number one when you smell it in a bag.
[SPEAKER_19]: But when you burn it or exhale a rip,
it's haze.
[SPEAKER_19]: It has this crazy haze flavor like
terpenaline or something in the air.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know the the Renee pretty well,
don't you, Chimera?
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you have to say about about that,
Renee?
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, I'm not even at my seat right
now, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, but thanks for asking me the
question.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, because Chimera was around as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's he was exposed to this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_19]: For me, Wade, the Renee cultivar was what
created the bubble bag success.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you do you know if Renee is in the
phylos galaxy project?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it is, but we can get it in
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what do you think happened to Renee?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you think she's the same as she always
was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, because I mean,
I don't either.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant that I had was, you know,
it smelled a lot like the Renee,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's it's got these small little tiny
flowers with the small there's always a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of inner sex in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You always did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's one of those plants that
can either it either really rocks or it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't, you know, but when you when you
really hit the cultivation, it really has
[SPEAKER_04]: that funk, like you said.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the funk, exactly, which is like the
funk that that that whatever that was that
[SPEAKER_19]: dab or that high put into the dab the dank
ass bitch.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wasn't that wasn't our cultivar called the
funk or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the ETF, the Emerald Triangle Funk
ETF.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: One way back.
[SPEAKER_19]: So listen, M.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dizzle, we don't know for sure if Renee
was a skunk.
[SPEAKER_19]: But listen, from my perspective,
Renee and the cheese are some version of
[SPEAKER_19]: the skunk is that is is that an arguable
fact or do you guys agree with that?
[SPEAKER_13]: That there's something I agree about
cheese because the first time I smelled
[SPEAKER_13]: it, I said, well, this is either skunk or
a skunk hybrid.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I eventually talked to the folks in
the UK and I found out that they had come
[SPEAKER_13]: over here and bought skunk number one
seeds, took them back and got the cheese.
[SPEAKER_19]: And did that cut come from Nick?
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that were those next friends?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: They think I got to remember what they
called themselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think it was him that I thought I
thought it was Nick from Red Eye magazine
[SPEAKER_19]: that gave it to Buddha because he
introduced me to Buddha when Buddha was
[SPEAKER_13]: just where did they get it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he got it from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_19]: He for sure did.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have some group called the I can't
remember their name, but it was a group
[SPEAKER_13]: name like the Whitehall guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would have been those guys,
I'm quite sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Nick wasn't a breeder,
he wasn't doing anything with seeds and
[SPEAKER_19]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: He just had really great access because he
was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the guy who told me this was was
very on the low down.
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't want publicity.
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't want anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just wanted to tell me that he is the
one who bought the seeds and his group
[SPEAKER_13]: named it the cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Marcus, do you still have access to
that, Renee?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people grow on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Still, I'm a few people, but I'm not
really sure if it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if it's ever really been the
same.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like I keep in mind,
I first saw the rename.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was like it must be around
2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was preaching when you showed up that
first day that you and I met, you were
[SPEAKER_04]: carrying a little piece of that Renee
bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you definitely had it back in 98,
at least.
[SPEAKER_19]: What a great bubble.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm telling you, we know when I put that
under people, people's noses, they went
[SPEAKER_19]: like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Their eyebrows always went up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I call that the bubble towel.
[SPEAKER_19]: The bubble towel is the eyebrow raise.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's two times that it happens when you
pull the 73 bag and the water pushes
[SPEAKER_19]: through and people are like, Oh,
and then when you put that Renee bubble
[SPEAKER_19]: under their nose and they're like,
Oh, that smells incredible.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you, did you happen to grow that using
soil balance pro?
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, Peter?
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, your waterfall little clip the other
day was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the good vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just like 30 seconds of
awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_19]: You were just like, love and abundance.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so grateful to be back.
[SPEAKER_10]: So grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I was with some very dear friends
helping me with soil balance.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were out at the waterfall and I was
like, I got to show this to you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to interrupt, but I thought
how to bring in some good nature,
[SPEAKER_10]: some good energy to the discussions that
you guys were having.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you know how sometimes you want things
to work out and they don't.
[SPEAKER_19]: And other times you want things to work
out and they did that really did just work
[SPEAKER_19]: out.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you first came in, I was like,
Jesus Christ, a waterfall that there can't
[SPEAKER_19]: be a louder white noise than a waterfall.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thought it was going to sound
absolutely horrible.
[SPEAKER_19]: And some, for some reason, probably
because you just have like the most
[SPEAKER_19]: positive attitude ever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, it didn't, it sounded great.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like we could actually hear it the way you
would want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not like just like white noise.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: So stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It came off with like a good vibe,
dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we're just celebrating 150,
uh, episodes of hash church.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were talking a little bit about the
skunk number one and some of the,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, incredible genetics that I suspected
had its play in cheese for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, and it kind of like Renee as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: It really is just, it's funny that the
thing that would stand out the most,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, all these years later ends up
being the thing that was created all these
[SPEAKER_19]: years prior.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's a, it's a tried and true.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could see skunk doing this for another
two or 300 years, like every, every 25
[SPEAKER_19]: years, a new generation going,
have you seen this shit?
[SPEAKER_19]: You have got to try this.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, okay, throw it in the machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see if it has the spikes.
[SPEAKER_19]: What spikes, you know, the spikes that are
going to tell us if it's a skunk number
[SPEAKER_19]: one or not.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those spikes, it looks so serious,
puffable.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's reading, studying.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a multitasker.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it is like working.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's probably reading like emails and
like, you know, running his, his empire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, you know, what are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a multitasker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always reading and science is always
coming into my inbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you got to keep up to,
uh, you know, there's so much changing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we're all at the tip of the
arrow head here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody has so many irons in the
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's so many things that are coming
at us all the time from the national
[SPEAKER_03]: standpoint, the international standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working still with stuff on the VA to
try and get medical marijuana to us
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans so that we can get access to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was working on a letter from that
from a Congresswoman who wrote to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when Congresswoman Rice,
she kind of like, okay, I better respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's not one of those things you're
like, oh, so that's why I was looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, oh shit, it's Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got something to do with,
you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: You totally had that look on your 100%.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you were in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, what is Tia is doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing a bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice and chill.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice and chill on a Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though it's not afternoon here,
it definitely is where Sam is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can still say it.
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Skunk number one is in everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I first went to Holland, it was crazy
how many of the coffee shops were just
[SPEAKER_19]: selling skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it was, it was trying to find a shop
that didn't sell it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was trying to find a shop that just sold
something else.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trying to find, you know, and that's how
we ended up at the Bluebird looking at all
[SPEAKER_19]: the import hashes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's how we ended up at the Bush
doctor.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause, uh, he was always into,
uh, into longer flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Transky always said different kinds of
African wheat.
[SPEAKER_13]: He did.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like there was a mafia or
something in, in the Netherlands producing
[SPEAKER_04]: large amounts of skunk.
[SPEAKER_19]: Know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: It almost is like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The skunk mafia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stank to high heaven, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're going to operate a mafia and
you're going to be doing some shit,
[SPEAKER_19]: then I think the best thing you could be
doing is just growing a ton of skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be a mafia, be a cannabis
mafia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do the, do the good work.
[SPEAKER_19]: Work of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't truly a mafia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a name, a name that was,
you know, passed around by some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other growers in the community that were
seeing the prices drop in the market
[SPEAKER_04]: because people were growing so much skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_19]: I met them back in the day because they
wanted to turn all their trim into hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they thought that more bags actually
would be better than less bags,
[SPEAKER_19]: even though the brainwashing was strong in
Holland during this timeline.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was kind of like, no, no, you just need
two bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, well, maybe, or in this case,
maybe not, or in this case, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was better for you to say it
than for me to say it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But on another note, I do miss Darren
saying bong rep.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's on his motorcycle right now with
chance.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing their annual 4,000 kilometer
ride up to like the Northwest territories
[SPEAKER_19]: or something.
[SPEAKER_19]: They do it so fast.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy's like a professional.
[SPEAKER_19]: He could definitely like crumble people
who think that they can ride a motorcycle
[SPEAKER_19]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how many of you have ridden a
motorcycle for more than like 50 to a
[SPEAKER_19]: hundred kilometers.
[SPEAKER_19]: But once you get into the like thousand
kilometers, 800 kilometers, like 500 plus
[SPEAKER_19]: miles in a day, let me tell you your ass
disappear.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to be a seriously strong
individual to hold your body up and to
[SPEAKER_19]: ride like a hundred plus K with the wind
blowing against you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the guy's a savage.
[SPEAKER_19]: So shout out to a chance and a D four 20
K.
[SPEAKER_19]: This rip is for you guys on your trip.
[SPEAKER_19]: Be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fucking maniacs and cars and RVs and semi
trailers paying attention to radios and
[SPEAKER_19]: phones.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know you guys are going to be safe,
but for God's sake, pay attention to the
main.
[SPEAKER_14]: I stopped writing because I realized that
my body would break.
[SPEAKER_14]: If bad things happened and it just wasn't
worth the rush anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, long rides, hard on the hands,
hard on the back, hard on the butt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always used to say for every thousand
miles you use, you lose a part of your
[SPEAKER_03]: ass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those guys are 3000 like four days or
something.
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll rock it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, it's unbelievable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This weekend started a recreational adult
use in Nevada in inclined village.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my dispensary new leaf was the first
dispensary and it opened yesterday to 21
[SPEAKER_03]: and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you to the entire new leaf crew
for kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Nevada, for being so
progressive.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that you had like hundreds of people
in line.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there are folks showed up,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have Nevada as well as we're
right on the California border.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, uh, anyone who hasn't a,
you know, a permit over 21, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: can come in, you know, as long as you have
a governmental ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, California or, you know,
definitely we had a lot of people from the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of Nevada, but we definitely get our
fair share from California as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope to see more and more of you
guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And enjoy the Lake Tahoe without any
repercussions because the law says
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_19]: As I'm, uh, giving two thumbs up for two
tiers down, I'll tell you the rips are
[SPEAKER_19]: real today, boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you hitting on?
[SPEAKER_19]: I am hitting on some beautiful five star
bubble hash that I made while I was in
[SPEAKER_19]: Ontario recently.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is greasy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Greasy, greasy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the cultivar is kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I know someone here locally who's
working with that right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a, it turned out nicer than I thought
when I first saw it, I kind of thought,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, I did a little, I sort of,
I like to just pick up the trim a little
[SPEAKER_19]: bit, stick my hands in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I noticed there was a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do you have a rabbi for when you
harvest your kosher Kush?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have multiple rabbis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the fellow I know who's working with
it locally here, uh, he is actually going
[SPEAKER_14]: through make having his farm, uh,
certified kosher and going to have
[SPEAKER_14]: somebody blessing the harvest.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to make it whole also?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I'm not in on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just know him.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm pretty excited for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, you make sure you get the word out
to him that we want halal as well as
[SPEAKER_19]: kosher.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Patented it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I guess you should all keep our eye
out for halal Kush next.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's the halal haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd, uh, I'd process that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love kosher kids, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's, uh, it turned out really,
really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, uh, you know, you never know what
you're going to unveil.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like I was going to say,
I didn't quite think it was going to be
[SPEAKER_19]: the quality that it turned out to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: So props on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always nice when it goes that way
rather than the other way, which it almost
[SPEAKER_19]: always goes, which is I thought it was
going to be great and it was not.
[SPEAKER_14]: You said it was greasy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's greasy.
[SPEAKER_19]: It greased right out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just like self pressed itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a brownie.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be one of those really thin,
gooey, gooey, gooey brownies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I use that as the metaphor because of
course, uh, yeah, last night I made
[SPEAKER_19]: brownies for my family, my kids.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the day before was chocolate chip
cookies.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm celebrating the fact that I have an
oven in my house.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, my oven broke like a year ago and I've
just, I was too busy and didn't get around
[SPEAKER_19]: to buying a new one.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you can imagine a year without an
oven in my house, pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your wife must be very happy with you
right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's very, very happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we have, uh, my mother-in-law lives in
the neighborhood, so we have access to an
[SPEAKER_19]: oven, but still, what a pain.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me tell you, we do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got an oven now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't go out and hunt for one on
the range.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, there's certain things I'm
pretty good at troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I usually, when there's an obstacle,
I can usually just overcome it,
[SPEAKER_19]: but there's the odd thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: And with this oven, it was a wall oven.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it has to be the exact like
measurements to the wall.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then it also was hooked up like right into
the, into the board.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not an electrician.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could deal with it, but I'm not bonded.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's like, you need an electrician.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you need another guy who's going to
like make sure when you get the oven,
[SPEAKER_19]: because it's measurements won't be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so these were the things that were
kind of keeping me from like, I was just
[SPEAKER_19]: like, you deal with it and go get an oven
and I'll just pay for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But, uh, she also found it to be an
obstacle to great because we went for a
[SPEAKER_19]: year without getting one.
[SPEAKER_19]: It happens, especially when you're chain
smoking, um, kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, someone asked a question, Peter,
and I would be amiss if I didn't ask it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They wanted to know what would be good
soil amendments to use with soil balance
[SPEAKER_19]: pro.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was asked about 10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: So whoever asked that questions,
apologies for the late.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so the, the organisms in soil balance
pro have been designed to be a
[SPEAKER_10]: saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what that means is that they're going
to mostly attached to roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can use them in, in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_10]: So initially after you inoculate,
what ends up happening is the
[SPEAKER_10]: microorganisms within a bottle.
[SPEAKER_10]: About 48 hour period, all 62 strains,
uh, encumber every single centimeter of
[SPEAKER_10]: the root.
[SPEAKER_10]: What, what, what ends up happening with a
lot?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what happened to us in the past was
that we were getting strains that were
[SPEAKER_10]: only inoculating maybe like four or five
inches.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now all of our strains, uh,
encumber everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: So every centimeter, every fine root hair.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and so it really doesn't matter what
you're using, uh, as far as like a soil
[SPEAKER_10]: medium goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you do want to be careful any soil
medium that you use you to, you're not
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of times, um, any organic
material in life has, has some pathogens
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as beneficials.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so when you're bringing in like peat
moss, vermiculite, you know, earthworm
[SPEAKER_10]: castings, uh, you're applying humic acid,
you're going to have that natural balance,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, um, as far as the best,
you know, as far as the best thing to use
[SPEAKER_10]: with, uh, with soil balance, again,
knowing that, uh, hydroponics is,
[SPEAKER_10]: is, uh, okay to, uh, to, to, to a
cultivation methodology.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: To utilize with our particular strains of
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I like to see humus compost.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to see earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I like to see, um, um, you know,
natural soil that has a good balance of
[SPEAKER_10]: macros.
[SPEAKER_10]: Micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, you want to kind of get,
um, the flavors, you know, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_10]: bit more indigenous and adding natural
soil, uh, with those other amendments
[SPEAKER_10]: could be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a huge fan of vermiculite and peat
moss, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I've just seen, you know,
biologically, uh, they're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they, they add, uh, to the bulk
density or they add to the, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: porosity of the soil, which is really
nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you have a good, uh, arrangement of
biodiversity, the respiration,
[SPEAKER_10]: the porosity should naturally,
uh, open up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like from a, from a biological
standpoint, if, if you've got tighter soil
[SPEAKER_10]: aggregates, so for instance, if you've got
a real high porosity soil, um,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not going to have as much of the
web-like structures that the microbes
[SPEAKER_10]: create.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the cool things, like everybody
knows mycorrhizae, they've been using it
[SPEAKER_10]: since Egyptian times, but you got to think
about the physics, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's say you've got a microbe,
a microbe, he's super tiny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these are little guys we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Marcus, I mean, they're, they're
little.
[SPEAKER_10]: So think about the space of, of,
of, of a fluffed soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be hard for them to maybe
jump to the next piece of organic material
[SPEAKER_10]: or carbon, especially if they're carbon
feeders.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the tighter the soil aggregates are,
the more of these guys can, can,
[SPEAKER_10]: can create like their web-like structures
and connect their, their communities
[SPEAKER_10]: throughout the entire, uh, environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the physics of the soil can play a good
part.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we really like natural soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it's been difficult for a
lot of producers to, uh, use natural soil
[SPEAKER_10]: because of the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you put, you put your plant into
a natural soil in Canada, let's say,
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's a real wet environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to get mildews.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get, uh, you know,
pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get rhizoptonia,
fusarium, verticillium, all these
[SPEAKER_10]: different pathogens that are naturally in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, but, um, so that's going into a
whole nother tangent.
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone asked, Oh, Oh, you got a weird,
weird, uh, let me try.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone asked what, uh, what do you feed
your bacterial life?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like molasses, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can use, um, good long chain
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_10]: So molasses is one of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a sugar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but feeding the microbes is a,
is an extremely important thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of our growers that are starting to
really get good quality have become micro
[SPEAKER_10]: farmers instead of, uh, you know,
just growing the plant and giving it the
[SPEAKER_10]: right nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they really realize that if you feed
the microbes, those microbes are going to,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, uh, dissolve that food and,
and, and do what's called a mineralization
[SPEAKER_10]: process.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happens is, is as they,
as you know, like sacrifice, sacrifice
[SPEAKER_10]: are, are organisms that will grow on
molasses.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll grow on humic acid or kelp or any
of these types of, of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, um, you want to make sure that the
quality of ingredient you're putting in is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to have the right macro
micronutrients, because as the organisms
[SPEAKER_10]: or the bacteria grow on this food source,
they're going to turn it into an insoluble
[SPEAKER_10]: humus, kind of like what earthworms do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, only a lot faster if you've got the
right biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I, what I've found that I really
like, um, is a good, um, humic acid,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, B BHA brown humic acid, which is
soluble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, what that's going to have is it's
going to have a really nice, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: macro micronutrient balance.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the macro micronutrients, uh,
the calcium, the boron manganese,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, you know, they're, they're all found
within, uh, humic acid derived from
[SPEAKER_10]: Leonardite.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to have a bit of a fulvic
in it, a tiny amount of fulvic and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and that, uh, uh, fulvic acid,
when the microbes go into it, they just
[SPEAKER_10]: love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they, they love that nutrients,
you know, um, they're like us,
[SPEAKER_10]: they like carbon vitamins and water,
the right microorganisms, the pathogens
[SPEAKER_10]: that are in the soil, they'll just eat
your plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's interesting that, you know,
they don't, they're, they're food source,
[SPEAKER_10]: the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they, they really just love eating for
the, that plant in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so, um, if you've got a good,
uh, food source, the beneficials will
[SPEAKER_10]: proliferate in, in the microscopic realm.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once you've got just an abundance of,
of good guys, the bad guys have a hard
[SPEAKER_10]: time, uh, gaining competency or gaining
traction to a point where they can
[SPEAKER_10]: actually inoculate your plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a good set of, of,
uh, of beneficials.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, the best food source for me is,
uh, is fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, compost tea is also a good one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of, that's going to have good
humics in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and then, you know, your kelp,
your, what I also really like,
[SPEAKER_10]: which not a lot of people use is,
uh, sea minerals.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sea minerals are awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, uh, if you can, if you can get,
you know, obviously the salts extracted
[SPEAKER_10]: and just get the base, the base nutrients,
uh, of those minerals.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you got to think about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The ocean is, is the perfect balance of
macro micronutrients to sustain life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point something out,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, uh, have you, are you familiar
with maxi?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a company that was called maxi and
they use nutrients from, from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was actually growing,
when I worked, uh, for Ed Rosenthal,
[SPEAKER_03]: we did a room where we grew these two
different strains and we grew with eight
[SPEAKER_03]: different fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was this maxi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found is it started to have,
um, it went bright green.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looked like it had a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out that, um, these sea
scrapings that they were utilizing had a
[SPEAKER_03]: third less molybdenum in them than all the
other fertilizers that we were using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so molybdenum helps break down the
nitrogen for the uptake for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we found is though,
even though it was a very beneficial,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, solution that was out there on the
market, um, we learned that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it was natural, it still was
missing something that was key,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was the molybdenum to keep up with
all the rest of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to point that out because
I do agree that, you know, the nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: from the ocean are excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but be aware of that type of situation
farmers that that can happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's yeah, that's, that's good wisdom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, one of the things that people are kind
of not, uh, really keying into because
[SPEAKER_10]: they've never really had the ability to
key into it before is working with a
[SPEAKER_10]: highly, uh, inoculated or a highly
biologically active soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so we're, we're, we're working right
now in mediums, you know, as artists
[SPEAKER_10]: within a canvas that is not fully alive
like it is in nature.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what ends up happening is we're looking
at nutrient, uh, implementation,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, from a standpoint of low biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what can the plant, what do we need to
put in there into, into this growing
[SPEAKER_10]: medium, uh, to really get the efficacy
that we want the terpenes, the,
[SPEAKER_10]: the, the big buds, all that, without a
living community within, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: that rhizosphere with, with on the plant
roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so mineral balancing and, and,
and fertilizer application has,
[SPEAKER_10]: has been modeled around a basis of,
of having no life really, or, or,
[SPEAKER_10]: or true biodiversity as it, as is the case
in nature, uh, on, on the root.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so with soil balance, once you have
that, that, that community, right,
[SPEAKER_10]: you've got trillions and trillions of
microbes in one gram, you've got 60
[SPEAKER_10]: trillion, uh, in one gram, then you've got
62 strains and you put that on the root.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that going to do to your,
your, your bio, bioavailable nutrient
[SPEAKER_10]: content?
[SPEAKER_10]: So then when you look at the macro micros
found in a, uh, a sea mineral,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're getting just the minerals and
they're, they're, they're, they're being
[SPEAKER_10]: created bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then if you've got that biodiversity,
you're going to have nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, not only from the, from the
respiration.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these guys, if you have a lot of
microbes, they're going to be breathing,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're going to be respirating because
they're living little creatures.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's nitrogen in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can pull that in the nitrogen that
you're putting in, you know, whether it be
[SPEAKER_10]: organically or conventionally is just so
much more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a natural peelating agent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you agree with that or do you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great breakdown.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would, I, I want to chime in.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, uh, uh, what you're describing is,
uh, really fundamental to my, what I have
[SPEAKER_14]: come to realize is my, is in my opinion,
the best way to create medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: If cannabis is as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what you've described is cultural
organisms that inoculate, cover the roots.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to try and summarize all that
beautiful thing you just did.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, yeah, by creating, uh,
nature in the soil, uh, I have,
[SPEAKER_14]: I have heavy clay soil here and it's
really been an interesting exercise
[SPEAKER_14]: because for a few years, uh, we had this
severe drought and so the clay soil was
[SPEAKER_14]: really bone dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: This past winter, it was saturated.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had more than a hundred inches of rain
here this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, uh, previous to this,
uh, layers of mulch on the soil,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, I would inoculate with compost tea,
like you had suggested, uh, I used a few,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, amendments, uh, um, anyway,
what I came to realize is the indigenous
[SPEAKER_14]: organisms that are on the soil here by
seeking them out and cultivating them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm seeing great benefit in the garden
because I realized that where nature is
[SPEAKER_14]: flourishing, the organisms that work in
the soil I have are already there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I can find a way to capture them
and a sample of them and then take them to
[SPEAKER_14]: the garden and feed them with the long
chain, uh, carbohydrates, like you were
[SPEAKER_14]: suggesting, uh, the soil has really come
alive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, all that, uh, micro, uh, life,
the food web, if you will, um,
[SPEAKER_14]: is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: It smells incredible.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love the way the soil changes color.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I go to dig a hole down into the
soil, the different layers reveal
[SPEAKER_14]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I found is that the cannabis
roots will climb out of the little hole
[SPEAKER_14]: that we put them in and find the right
layer and run out, making a web literally
[SPEAKER_14]: in the soil so that when we pull the
plants, it's like a fish net.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what that does that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, what's happening if you, if you're
cultivating the right, um, and I love how
[SPEAKER_10]: you say it life, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Your life on the roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they actually enzymatically
communicate with the root.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what these guys are doing is they're
having a little conversation and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and as they cruise out into the soil,
they find like a calcium particle.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, Hey, these are the givers,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the microorganisms that actually
care about the longterm sustainability of
[SPEAKER_10]: that plant, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll throw out into the soil and then
they'll find the calcium and then they'll,
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll enzymatically communicate with the
root to say, Hey, grow over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's calcium over here because they
want the longterm survival.
[SPEAKER_10]: And let me just digress real quick on
this, uh, conversation, but I'm so happy
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're talking about life,
uh, on the 150th anniversary of church and
[SPEAKER_10]: so apropos, so beautiful to be discussing
this, but, um, another thing I wanted to
[SPEAKER_10]: talk about, uh, is, is the mycorrhizae
because one of the things that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: probably experiencing in your grow,
if you're, if you're, uh, creating that
[SPEAKER_10]: environment is mycorrhizae is in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's in our lungs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're, um, if you have a good
quality soil that has a high amount of
[SPEAKER_10]: life in it, this is probably why your
roots are coming where they are is,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, is because, uh, we've found
mycorrhizae growing on the roots of of
[SPEAKER_10]: plants without even inoculating the soil
with mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That respiration, that, that respiration,
if you have a high microbial water called
[SPEAKER_10]: titters of, uh, of microbes, they will
breathe and they will pull in that oxygen
[SPEAKER_10]: into your soil and, and mycorrhizae will
go down with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's naturally how it does it in a
forest or anywhere that there's a,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, high abundance of plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's probably why you're,
your roots are, are netting and you
[SPEAKER_10]: probably have good, good biodiversity
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, good job.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your word.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a really, um, I like companion
planting, um, growing other things,
[SPEAKER_14]: herbs, perennial herbs in the garden
space, uh, helps sustain life around the
[SPEAKER_14]: year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, another thing, uh, you, you may,
you, it's likely that lactobacillus is one
[SPEAKER_14]: of the types of, uh, beneficial plants
that are in your, in your material that
[SPEAKER_14]: you're discussing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, lactobacillus is a really fun one
because it's easy to capture lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_14]: from the air.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's a fairly simple process of
allowing milk to sit at room temperature
[SPEAKER_14]: for anywhere from four days to 10 days and
cover it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So macro organisms can't get to it,
but let the air flow by it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all kinds of beautiful things start
growing there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then at some point you can sift strain
off the solids and the liquid that comes
[SPEAKER_14]: through.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you add water, that's clean of chlorine
or chloramine, uh, to that and molasses,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, you have an inoculation of the
lactobacillus cultures that are in the
[SPEAKER_14]: air, all kinds of bacteria land in the
milk, but only lactobacillus can survive
[SPEAKER_14]: in the milk.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you strain off the solids,
that can go to your compost pile.
[SPEAKER_14]: But meantime, that liquid is a really
beautiful soil inoculation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Put in lactobacillus right down into the
cultures, into the soil, in your mulch.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, all that food web thing starts
going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've never used lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there's, but, um, there's been,
we use soil microorganisms or organisms
[SPEAKER_10]: that are like isolated just from the root
zone naturally on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, and a lot of the strains that are
out these days, like there's bacillus
[SPEAKER_10]: subtilis, trichoderma, mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_10]: These have all been used for over a
hundred years, you know, obviously for
[SPEAKER_10]: people because they do a good job,
but our product, our product would
[SPEAKER_10]: function with the same efficacy without
any of those strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you took out our mycorrhizae,
if you took out our bacillus subtilis,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, if you took out our trichoderma,
we would still get the results because
[SPEAKER_10]: we're utilizing newly discovered,
um, strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of those are streptomyces strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what those guys are doing is something
incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have some unique ones in there
that I get the best thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a, such a good place to say
this on Hatch Church, because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: like a holy thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So listen to this, the strains that we
have in our product, they are,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're givers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they understand that their long-term
survival is contingent on the health of
[SPEAKER_10]: their plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you relate that to humans,
uh, the long-term care and compassion for
[SPEAKER_10]: our planet, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some of us like you that
understand if we care for our planet,
[SPEAKER_10]: if we give each other, you know,
cannabis medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: People like you, you guys know that
there's others that feel that this earth
[SPEAKER_10]: is just here for our own survival.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can take care of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can take care of our own families and
not, and not care about the collective
[SPEAKER_10]: interdependence that we all share with one
another and our planet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what's so cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: About, uh, the soil balance microbes is
that every single one that we found,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, is a giver.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what they give is they give an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's the real cool thing about
microbiology that you're going to love.
[SPEAKER_10]: So microorganisms, what our
microbiologists found was that it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: what a microbe can do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not what a microorganism can do on
its own.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of people are like,
Hey, this microbe, does this, this microbe
[SPEAKER_10]: does that we got nitrogen fixation,
phosphorus, solubilization, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, aeration.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And our microbiologists came out with,
with the idea that it's not what a mic,
[SPEAKER_10]: a microbe does on its own, but what they
produce in combination that make them
[SPEAKER_10]: effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: And our microbes create, um, secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they're called scientifically,
but they're like enzymes, hormones,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically micro piss, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: These little things, they, they shit and
they piss.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so those are called secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you get a bunch of them together,
that what they make together, like is the
[SPEAKER_10]: most amazing thing for the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It communicates with the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tells the plant to grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tells the plant where the nutrient is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tells them when to absorb more water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause water's present.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this, it's this, uh, it, it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a chelating agent on the roots to,
to allow like a calcium particle that
[SPEAKER_10]: you're putting in to be decomposed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the plank can, can eat it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to add that, uh, it occurs to me
that it allows the plant to select what it
[SPEAKER_14]: needs when it needs it, instead of us
force feeding it what we think we needed
[SPEAKER_14]: on our schedule, instead of the plant
following her own schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wisdom.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is beautiful wisdom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that that's exactly we, we,
we, we, we in inoculating the soil in the
[SPEAKER_10]: correct ways, we're allowing nature to be
earth's most advanced technology.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good wisdom.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we sit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the church, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just reading the text from Tony.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's going to be in in a little bit and,
uh, yeah, we've got some other guests that
[SPEAKER_19]: will be dropping in throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, good vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're an hour in.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've already had some pretty good,
uh, knowledge dropped and some stories
[SPEAKER_19]: told.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, yeah, thank you guys for all
showing up and being a part of the convo
[SPEAKER_19]: station.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Peter, I would love to get to know you
better.
[SPEAKER_14]: So where are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Look?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a way to do that,
uh, out of this context, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you want, you'd like to,
um, check out a little bit more of our
[SPEAKER_10]: work.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go to soil balance pro.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pro that'll give you the technology,
what we're doing as well as, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a little bit about what we've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm really looking forward to trying
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ordered at their last house church
and, uh, good day everybody and happy one
[SPEAKER_02]: 50.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we brought, I also brought what you
sent me to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I'm not sure if our master grower got
in touch with you yet, but we'll
[SPEAKER_19]: definitely make sure you guys have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause, uh, we want to, we want to,
we want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to, it just makes too much sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's, what's interesting is that,
you know, um, all of these conversations,
[SPEAKER_10]: the last couple of hash churches that
I've, that I've been, or that I've
[SPEAKER_10]: watched, I wasn't able to make the last
couple, but it's still, it's still
interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like all of the heads of the,
of the conversation dovetailed to the
[SPEAKER_10]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like, you know, all these
different things, all these different
[SPEAKER_10]: issues, it all comes back to, um,
you know, the biology of the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's like, Oh, you got to feed the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and what's so genius about that is
that people are really starting to
[SPEAKER_10]: understand that bacteria is what creates
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: The secondary metabolites that they're
creating, they're, they're creating
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, um, they're again, communicating
with that plant to make a lot of terpenes
[SPEAKER_10]: so that that plant can protect itself so
that it can protect them, create a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that way fungus doesn't grow on you and
kill us down here in this roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a question for you, um,
bringing it back to what you just brought
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also that's super interesting what
you're talking about with the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: also creating, uh, and making their own
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, keep in mind there's over
20,000 different types of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoid structures that have been
identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a huge class of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what I wanted to talk about a
little bit is how do you find your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes are protecting the planet against
infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've been reading a bit about
powdery mildew and Sam, you can jump in on
[SPEAKER_01]: this also cause I've been reading a little
bit, um, just trying to figure out what,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, types of fungi are causing and
contributing to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Sam's book with John McCartland,
um, and Robert Clark, their hemp diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: and pests book, they mentioned two
specific types of pathogens that cause
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will attempt to pronounce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one is pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it has a, it has a different name
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now referred to as podosphere
macularis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was formally, how do I say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spas, roteca, macularis, macularis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm totally butchering that
pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I know more about bacteria and
competing microbes in terms of human
[SPEAKER_01]: health and how those epic battles that are
happening in the gut, um, and how our
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes are, like you're
saying, giver nutrients for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making, um, short chain fatty
acid, beneficial compounds, even terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that hasn't been, uh, investigated
to my knowledge as much in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, but absolutely they're playing
a role in signaling and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just bringing it back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are these micro blends protecting
against infectious pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also since you're, um, administering
your into the roots, like is this getting
[SPEAKER_01]: up into the flowers of the plant or are
your micro blends staying more in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyway, two points I was just kind
of thinking about if you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, speak to.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so I think to, to kind of explain the
best, the best place to start would be,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, talking about the pathogen itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so we'll talk with downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Downy and powdery are pretty much the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Downy affects a lot, a lot larger crops,
but powdery and downy mildew are a big,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, disease that faces the cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what a lot of people don't know is
where the powdery and downy mildew come
[SPEAKER_10]: from, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_10]: So in any organic compound, here's a good
question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do earthworms come from?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They just kind of show up in the soil
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of the same idea as
powdery and downy mildews.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so downy mildew comes in the form of
an OO spore.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's something called an OO spore.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this little black bowling ball and
it's so small.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like microscopic and it comes in
inorganic material.
[SPEAKER_10]: So remember earlier I was saying that,
um, you know, um, there's the good guys
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's the bad guys, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, when you're bringing in like any
natural soil or any, any type of a medium
[SPEAKER_10]: that has, uh, or an organic element to it
is going to probably have these little OO
[SPEAKER_10]: spores.
[SPEAKER_10]: These, these little, these little OO
spores have, um, the actual fungi inside
[SPEAKER_10]: of it called perinospora or, um,
uh, uh, downy and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so these little like black bowling
balls are hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't kill them with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're, they're really tough
and they live on little microscopic,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, pieces of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when the temperature is perfect,
when the, uh, the humidity or the moisture
[SPEAKER_10]: content within that medium is perfect,
these little OO spores that are like
[SPEAKER_10]: bowling balls, they're rocks and they have
the, the, the, the powdery mildew inside
[SPEAKER_10]: of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They burst.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what happens is if you don't have
beneficial colonies, um, in your soil,
[SPEAKER_10]: what ends up happening is they,
this fungi will grow super fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like in 24 hours, it's going to colonize
the roots and it could grow up to the top
[SPEAKER_10]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then if you're blowing your, your,
your vents, right, you got your vents
[SPEAKER_10]: blowing and you've got your, your.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I have to interrupt here just for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've, I've studied this for a really long
time and this as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, powdery and downy mildew are neither
one systemic.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to hit the spot on the leaf or
wherever on the plant that is going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: infected.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does not get transmitted systemically.
[SPEAKER_13]: And unless this is brand new science that
I'm somehow missing, that's absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a hundred percent right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a systemic, um, it's not a
systemic, uh, disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happens is these little bowling
balls called OO spores, they're in organic
[SPEAKER_10]: matter, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the soil, in the soil medium,
they're not in the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not in the system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They grow and they gain competency in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they, they, and then wind can
blow them from the soil or water can push,
[SPEAKER_10]: hit, have them hit the plant leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they hit the plant leaf, then they can
grow on the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't see it until it actually starts
to colonize or get to a point of
[SPEAKER_10]: competency where that disease is,
is, is encumbering your leafs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so to kind of go, go back,
I'm trying to, I'm trying to help
[SPEAKER_10]: identify, you know, why there there's the
cause of this particular disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of the universities will come out
and say, oh, powdery and downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to come in from the vent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to come in from the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, but, but if you really do a strong
analysis from a sustainable point of view,
[SPEAKER_10]: these little OO spores, they're like
earthworms, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're these little eggs and they live in
your organic material and all organic
[SPEAKER_10]: material can have it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a natural part of the balance.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's good and there's bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's that combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Peter, before you finish, I just want
to relate this one sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to relate this back to a human
disease that might help some people
[SPEAKER_01]: visualize and understand what the concepts
you're just describing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was just, I found it really
similar to something like a clostridium
[SPEAKER_01]: difficile infection that is a big issue
for gastrointestinal disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is everyone has,
like you were saying, like these little
[SPEAKER_01]: spores, but in turn, this is the
clostridium difficile spores and they live
[SPEAKER_01]: in your gut for the majority of the
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not cause any issues, but when
they do cause a problem is when people get
[SPEAKER_01]: admitted to a hospital, they have to go on
long-term intense antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is it destroys all your
regular microflora causes a shift in your
[SPEAKER_01]: gut population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now these spores, they've got all this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any competition for
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any competition for space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now they grow, they take over,
they attach to the gut and they cause a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's interesting the point you're
bringing up about, again, how these spores
[SPEAKER_01]: are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have those protective
microorganisms, essentially acting as your
[SPEAKER_01]: army to protect the plant when these
spores do turn into an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it's fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it's interesting relating
these concepts back to bacteria infecting
[SPEAKER_01]: a human and bacteria infecting a plant
because it's very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, sorry to interrupt,
continue.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you just said, Natasha, is actually
the answer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what you're tuning into naturally
and finding that parallel is exactly what
[SPEAKER_10]: we need to be doing in our soils.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our plants are a part of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a part of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole system, our whole reality is
interconnected and interdependent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to parallel those similarities between
the plants diseases and human diseases is
[SPEAKER_10]: right on point.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are right on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just thinking out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought two plants to my house about a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice big, tall plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within five days, they're sitting in my
yard in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my yard has a disease or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark made mention of my grapes and stuff
like that because I'm constantly fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: PM around my area where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the neighbors have it in their plants
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, so there's a disease in the
area that I have to kind of work on,
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes two parts, John.
[SPEAKER_13]: One is a source of infection, which you've
explained quite clearly.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other part is susceptibility or
resistance.
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, jungle narrowleaf tropical
equatorial varieties that are grown in
[SPEAKER_13]: jungles, they have natural resistance or
they wouldn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'd be all gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas varieties from the further north
with widely drug variety genetics in them,
[SPEAKER_13]: they have no resistance coming from high
up in the mountains, really dry in
[SPEAKER_13]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say number one, really
important besides the health of the soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: which I agree in, I'm a biodynamic grower
myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing that's really important is
varieties which are resistant because I
[SPEAKER_13]: used to be trialing all kinds of different
varieties side by side in pretty tight
[SPEAKER_13]: spaces, really tall, 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would see whole imported populations
from Afghanistan and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: They looked like they were snowed on.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were so white, some of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would start destroying them.
[SPEAKER_13]: But right next to them in the middle of
them would be an equatorial variety with
[SPEAKER_13]: zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if the white powdery mildew fell all
over on top of the other one, it still did
[SPEAKER_08]: not get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was gonna say the same thing,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I knew, it was also airborne.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two ways to look at that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like if you're gonna put your plants
outside, you better have the right variety
[SPEAKER_15]: that has a resistance to it along with the
soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of times on greenhouses,
especially hoop houses, you'll see people
[SPEAKER_15]: will try to pre-treat the air quality
before it just passes through the actual
[SPEAKER_15]: whole hoop house with the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously from a microbiological
standpoint, Tony, we've really looked at
[SPEAKER_10]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at the ratios, if you talk to
a plant pathologist, which we have on
[SPEAKER_10]: staff, if you're actually looking at the
percentages or the ratios of this
[SPEAKER_10]: particular disease and when colonization
is gonna happen on the plant tissue and
[SPEAKER_10]: leaf, the idea right now in the
universities and with the intellectuals
[SPEAKER_10]: that are really trying to refine this,
killing the biology out of your room or
[SPEAKER_10]: sterilizing and using alcohol and then
putting different things on your plants,
[SPEAKER_10]: really, if you have the correct beneficial
microflora colonizing, again, the macro
[SPEAKER_10]: micronutrients that we were talking about
in the soil, you're going to have those
[SPEAKER_10]: beneficials, what I call those givers,
completely at super high microbial
[SPEAKER_10]: titters.
[SPEAKER_10]: So on a microscopic level, there's only so
much space and a lot of people are saying,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, the disease is being blown in or
it's coming in from the rain or it's in
[SPEAKER_10]: the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's true, but it's also gaining
competency in the soil medium.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be hydroponic, it could be a
cocoa, it could be a soil medium,
[SPEAKER_10]: but whatever organic material is allowing
it to increase in competency next to the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant so that it can actually attach
itself as a fungi, grow up that plant and
[SPEAKER_10]: begin to colonize.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, if you've got very high
beneficial counts, we're talking,
[SPEAKER_10]: and this is something that nobody really
looks at is the actual microorganisms per
[SPEAKER_10]: gram of soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've looked at thousands of soils over
the years and the average soil possesses
[SPEAKER_10]: between 2,000 and 5,000 microorganisms of
the correct beneficials conducive to plant
[SPEAKER_10]: health and growth per gram, a really good
average soil should have seven to eight
[SPEAKER_10]: orders of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they should be up at like at least a
million colony forming units of beneficial
[SPEAKER_10]: microorganisms per gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to find the correct strains that are
actually going to be regenerative,
[SPEAKER_10]: that are going to sustain, that are going
to be a regenerative technology that
[SPEAKER_10]: disallow the encumbrance of pathogens that
are there to kill your plant, just like
[SPEAKER_10]: Natasha was saying, if you can create that
balance where the good guys are just so
[SPEAKER_10]: much greater, the bad guys will be
naturally disallowed from encumbering that
[SPEAKER_10]: space.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's only a certain amount of space
from a microscopic level and powdery and
[SPEAKER_10]: downy mildew can only grow so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look at the physics of it,
if you've got the good guys in like a
[SPEAKER_10]: spot, the bad guys are going to grow and
they're going to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the bad guys need that traction to
gain competency to actually colonize the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Man, let me tell you, some people are real
good at cultivating those bad guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to Forrest from the Caladrius
Network in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to our friends in the coots there,
Dragonfly Medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And welcome to Tony.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tony snuck in there as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, we're just having a good
discussion.
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems to be it's constantly all about
this sort of symbiotic nature of these
[SPEAKER_19]: bacteria on the roots that Peter has come
and shared with us.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, you know, Natasha,
which was crazy while he was talking
[SPEAKER_19]: before you, like I felt I feel like I'm
psychic almost because I was like,
[SPEAKER_19]: I was even going to ask, I was like,
well, what do you think about that,
[SPEAKER_19]: Natasha?
[SPEAKER_19]: And how does that relate to gut health?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then without even saying that,
you were like, can I just interrupt for a
[SPEAKER_19]: second?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just need to say this.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you said kind of, I didn't know
exactly what you were going to say because
[SPEAKER_19]: it's not my level of expertise.
[SPEAKER_19]: I merely hear it from you here and there,
but it was well played and I'm glad that
[SPEAKER_19]: it was exactly on point.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone was saying in chat, oh,
Peter's just talking nonsense now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm like, I don't think he is because
the one person in the room with a PhD just
[SPEAKER_19]: related to exactly what he said,
engaged with him and then compared it to
[SPEAKER_19]: something she knows to be the truth in
one's gut health and one's gut.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a PhD, but I do have a THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: You do have a THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a THC in THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we can even like look at some of
the bacteria and microbes stuff and to the
[SPEAKER_01]: person who hasn't read or really immersed
themselves in that literature or that
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, it can be a lot like the
outsider looking into cannabis where it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like, how can it do all these
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you start looking into all the
different things bacteria can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of bacteria like people
living on a planet and like you're the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet or the plant is the planet and the
bacteria are the inhabitants and it's you
[SPEAKER_01]: or the plant providing nutrients and
resources to keep that population healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: and just like the good guys and the bad
guys, if that's how we want to classify
[SPEAKER_01]: it, shifts can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad guys can take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The host can become unhealthy or if the
host doesn't have proper nutrition or
[SPEAKER_01]: other factors, then the host population is
not going to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even wanted to just shift it a
little bit to nutrition and talking again
[SPEAKER_01]: about powdery mildew and other infections
and talking about nutrients for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I've noticed and I've
been just reading a little bit about and
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I know more about this in the human
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been looking at kind of nutrient
interactions in the gut and nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be good for bacteria in certain
amounts, but then in other amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good example of this is iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So iron is an essential nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We absolutely need it for growth,
all kinds of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And iron is similar to a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs small amounts of iron to be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But issues arise when there's too much
iron, especially with humans and in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of when you, for instance, eat a lot,
say you're under risk of infection and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're eating a lot of red meats that are
rich in heme iron, that is an excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: source of iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have an infection, you're also
feeding bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And iron is a pathogen's favorite food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm curious if the similar
situation can happen if a cannabis or hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has an iron overload, would this
make them more susceptible to infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps a plant that is infected,
if trying strategies to maybe reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: iron content could also be a strategy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our biology, Natasha, and this is what
we've tested for so many years,
[SPEAKER_10]: for 20 years, we've been refining exactly
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have the correct bacteria in
the rye isosphere, the organisms will
[SPEAKER_10]: actually regulate the absorption or
non-absorption of the macro
[SPEAKER_10]: micronutrients, your iron.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful natural occurrence.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what we've done is hundreds of
different leaf tissue analysis with
[SPEAKER_10]: different laboratories and found that the
nutrient balance within that root or plant
[SPEAKER_10]: is perfectly balanced with the correct
biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you really don't have to worry about
that issue.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's if you're organically growing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But a little tip, which I find that
interesting that you brought that up,
[SPEAKER_15]: Natasha, was if you're a deep water
culture grower growing hydroponically,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is why I agree with what he's
saying is if you're doing everything in
[SPEAKER_15]: the soil and you're doing everything you
could and you have the right environment,
[SPEAKER_15]: you strengthen the plant from the roots.
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those that are deep water culture
and hydro, which I've done both,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you use a magnetic pump, what I mean by
that is if you have a big reservoir and
[SPEAKER_15]: you're mixing even organic-based nutrients
or premixed one, two, and three solutions,
[SPEAKER_15]: people have different nutrient bases that
are out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why people spend a lot of money
on these dositrons and different pump
[SPEAKER_15]: systems is because sometimes when you're
growing in a basement or something or
[SPEAKER_15]: growing at home, you don't think about
these little things but the pumping system
[SPEAKER_15]: itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're pumping your nutrients
through a pump that uses a magnetic drive,
[SPEAKER_15]: you actually could be stripping out all
the magnesium and you could be stripping
[SPEAKER_15]: out any of the irons that are actually
necessary for the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why a lot of indoor growers,
in my opinion, they're not paying
[SPEAKER_15]: attention to something as simple as that
is that if the nutrients are being pumped
[SPEAKER_15]: through something and it's not the right
kind of pump and there's magnetics used
[SPEAKER_15]: involved in that pump, you actually could
be pulling things out of their water or
[SPEAKER_15]: their essential nutrients, therefore
causing a deficiency in some kind,
[SPEAKER_15]: which would then lead it to more
susceptible to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've seen it in the indoor and how
simple that could work.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I feel like there's advantages and
disadvantages when you're doing something
[SPEAKER_15]: like a feed to waste or like an aeroponic
type of system because you don't really
[SPEAKER_15]: ever let the soil to be alive.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like washing a nutrient across the
roots and then the roots have to soak it
[SPEAKER_15]: up and they have a certain amount of time
to soak it up and then it get washed away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you keep kind of doing that cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the live soils present a lot of
different defense strategy, if you will,
[SPEAKER_15]: in the plant and it's in its growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: So people negate that and they don't
realize that they could be affecting the
[SPEAKER_15]: course of that plant and its immunity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because remember, we're not growing just a
flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're growing a little tiny baby.
[SPEAKER_15]: Watching it grow all the way up into
adolescence, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes through its whole life cycle,
hormone changes, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to give it the proper guidance
and the proper starting and nutrients and
[SPEAKER_15]: things for it to actually succeed when
it's an adult.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's why a lot of people
don't do organic growing because it takes
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot more, a little bit more work and a
little bit more love that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why, Tony, I'm sorry,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Natasha, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why what's nice about what we've
tried to develop over time is that whether
[SPEAKER_10]: you're growing conventionally or
synthetically or organically, what we've
[SPEAKER_10]: found is the correct strains that will
create that natural ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_10]: that biological ecosystem for any grower,
even in hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's been the main goal of what
we've been trying to do because so far
[SPEAKER_10]: there's been a black and a white,
like, okay, if I'm growing this way,
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't have this natural benefit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why our product was developed.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to find the strains that are
naturally occurring on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: A conventional grower who's using
synthetic nutrients can plug us in and
[SPEAKER_10]: have that balance of nutrient absorption
naturally, as Natasha was talking about,
[SPEAKER_10]: a healthy digestive system, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been almost as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really trying to just mimic what
we've seen in nature, which is what
[SPEAKER_10]: growing a crop is anyways, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so through the advancement of
understanding the actual microbiology or
[SPEAKER_10]: the particular strains that have
co-evolved with this plant in its natural
[SPEAKER_10]: environment, maybe one of the reasons that
you guys saw no powdery or downy mildew on
[SPEAKER_10]: those particular strains is because those
terpenes were so high that that particular
[SPEAKER_10]: plant had the conducive biology it needed
to produce the terpenes to stop it from
[SPEAKER_10]: getting powdery and downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that kind of goes- I saw a high
terpene in both susceptible and resistant
[SPEAKER_13]: varieties, although there might be some
correlation between particular terpenes
[SPEAKER_13]: and resistance.
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't the main thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: The main thing that I saw was that
varieties from tropical, from equatorial,
[SPEAKER_13]: hot, humid, wet areas have natural
resistance to both botrytis and powdery
[SPEAKER_13]: mildew, whereas varieties from Afghanistan
have zero resistance and the hybrids also
[SPEAKER_13]: have problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: Different biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's right on point.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think one thing that hasn't been
mentioned in here, and just to bring it
[SPEAKER_16]: up, is the incredible intelligence of the
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the possibility that we can
actually outsmart microbiology is,
[SPEAKER_16]: in my mind, totally null and void.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's great that we can
scientifically look at it and we can ally
[SPEAKER_16]: with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's so many more microbiology and
fungi spores than us on the planet.
[SPEAKER_16]: And rather than isolating and trying to
figure out, I like to look at it more in a
[SPEAKER_16]: holistic view that rather than create some
kind of an environment that you're putting
[SPEAKER_16]: them into, why are we not joining them?
[SPEAKER_16]: And trying to create an environment that
is joining them rather than separating the
[SPEAKER_16]: plants from it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm also noticing on the planet is
that we're talking a lot about our sick
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis plants and farmers are talking a
lot about their sick plants and then
[SPEAKER_16]: doctors are talking a lot about their sick
patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's happening on the planet is
something very holistic right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're being attacked on many different
levels and I think that we can see the
[SPEAKER_16]: degradation of life on the planet since
the 1940s, since synthetics and
[SPEAKER_16]: petrochemical fertilizers have come about.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're creating new different types of
pathogens and we're losing a lot of our
[SPEAKER_16]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why we focus on cultivating our
indigenous microorganisms, the ones that
[SPEAKER_20]: are in our local areas.
[SPEAKER_20]: So like for our farms and gardens,
we're cultivating our local indigenous
[SPEAKER_20]: ones because nothing can fight those.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's been a methodology, you guys,
for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you guys are doing is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're coming from a place of let's feed
what's naturally in the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: But think about this concept.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if the plant that you have decided to
bring from France, let's say if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: growing a wine vineyard grapes from
France, they've naturally co-evolved with
[SPEAKER_10]: their specific microorganisms in France,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how that plant has been evolving
for a million years and you decide to
[SPEAKER_10]: bring it to Texas.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you put that plant in Texas and the
naturally occurring organisms that it
[SPEAKER_10]: needs are not there.
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter how much food you put in,
no matter how much macro micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_10]: humic acid, compost, you're never going to
give microbes that are not there and never
[SPEAKER_10]: will be there, the correct food source.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we're doing on our planet is we're
doing something that's natural.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a part of the process, but it's also
we're taking plants and growing them in
[SPEAKER_10]: their non-native agro ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're deciding to grow these plants on
your farm that should never have been
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're deciding to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: With that context behind it, to stop some
of the problems or the health issues or to
[SPEAKER_10]: allow the plant to reach its full genetic
potential, you can put as much in there
[SPEAKER_10]: and you may never have the correct biology
that that plant needed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I totally respect and embrace and I
have gratitude for what you're saying
[SPEAKER_10]: about working with the natural organisms
in the soil, but we also have to look at
[SPEAKER_10]: our footprint and how that plant may never
have really wanted to be there in the
[SPEAKER_10]: first place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a quick question to add to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're talking about, you know,
just so hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to jump right in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many beautiful faces.
[SPEAKER_12]: My quick question is let's curb this
conversation towards environmental
[SPEAKER_12]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hear that we are creating microbial
media for these beautiful plants,
[SPEAKER_12]: but if we are sourcing from countries or
origins that aren't necessarily beneficial
[SPEAKER_12]: for the greater picture, what are some
things to keep in mind?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like as a classic example,
let's talk about bat guano.
Go.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's a form of climatizing things.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we've been bringing food and
medicine, plants and seeds and varieties
[SPEAKER_20]: since the, you know, the existence of
humans.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, it's not going to be the
same as it was in Afghanistan or Morocco.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be grown in the,
in the different ecosystem that's here.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's definitely true that you can't
totally produce the exact same compounds
[SPEAKER_20]: in the mountains and in Morocco as you can
in, you know, the, the cascades of Oregon
[SPEAKER_20]: or whatever, it's going to be a different,
you know, microbiology set.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I feel like the best you can hope for
is to enhance your local climate,
[SPEAKER_20]: your whole, your local environment to
express that, those medicinal compounds or
[SPEAKER_20]: food compounds within your own
environment.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, growing it in the desert,
growing it with different water and
[SPEAKER_20]: different cities, getting bat guano from,
you know, Peru or sphagnum peat moss from
[SPEAKER_20]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, once you went in an indoor garden,
you're, you're basically, you're,
[SPEAKER_20]: you're creating a new environment.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, you might, you know,
look into isolating compounds for that,
[SPEAKER_20]: but you can also build your local
environment, you know, in your,
[SPEAKER_20]: like for an indoor setup in your parking
lot or on a farm locally by and bring it
[SPEAKER_20]: indoors and create as much of a local
environment indoors as possible.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think as far as bringing seeds or
products from another part of the world,
[SPEAKER_20]: you're taking a chance because you don't
know the process that it took for that to
[SPEAKER_20]: get to you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes it's fumigated, sometimes it's
radiated.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good God only knows what happened to it,
how long it's been sitting, whether it was
[SPEAKER_20]: microbial in a pile before it got onto a
container and got brought to you.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a huge amount of questions the
farther that something comes from,
[SPEAKER_20]: from your local environment.
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you can produce stuff in a healthy
way in your local environment,
[SPEAKER_20]: you're going to enhance your climatized
version of that strain or that seed
[SPEAKER_20]: variation or food variety to the best of
your ability.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what terroir is about.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what Appalachian is about.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what the beauty of having
different, that's why Humboldt's awesome
[SPEAKER_20]: and the Cascades are awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: And British Columbia is awesome because
there's different organisms enhancing
[SPEAKER_20]: different compounds to come up.
[SPEAKER_20]: The plant is going to change.
[SPEAKER_20]: It will not be the same as it started
with, but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what we have to think about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes, you know, even in really
good soil from what we've seen,
[SPEAKER_10]: our microbiologists have seen,
you know, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to like, you know,
thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the plant will change, but what
we've seen farming on a larger scale
[SPEAKER_10]: coming into what are called, you know,
heterogeneous soils, meaning that all
[SPEAKER_10]: soils have, have so many different,
you know, from one square foot to the next
[SPEAKER_10]: soil is different.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when you take a plant, even from
Northern California and move it to
[SPEAKER_10]: Southern California, into a heterogeneous
soil, you never know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so adding the correct microbe strains
that may be co-evolved with that plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: why it naturally grew, you know,
in that area by itself and taking those
[SPEAKER_10]: strains of biology of bacteria and putting
them in with that plant that we're
[SPEAKER_10]: deciding to move to its non-indigenous
area is one of the things that humans have
[SPEAKER_10]: not really done.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're worried about fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're worried about watering techniques.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're worried about amendments and food
sources, but looking at the life,
[SPEAKER_10]: the actual life that these plants need
that they've co-evolved with is like
[SPEAKER_10]: taking our own digestive system out of
ourselves and just putting them into an
[SPEAKER_10]: environment that could have powdery and
downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could have pythium.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could have risoctonia.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could have sclerotinia, gaiomanomyces,
all these diseases that may be in that
[SPEAKER_10]: soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're just seeing what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, compost is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most organic growers, like I'm sure you
guys are doing, are applying heavy amounts
[SPEAKER_10]: of compost and different amendments to get
that soil to a point of competency where
[SPEAKER_10]: you can cultivate organically.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if you look at compost or,
again, any organic material, it's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: have its balance.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have its balance of
pathogenic and beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it can take two to three years to get a
soil to a point of competency where you
[SPEAKER_10]: can grow organically and your plants will
be safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, what we've done is we've
identified the good guys that regenerate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's kind of the approach that
we've taken with soil balance.
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, I'll leave your information.
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say, I think to answer
her question, though, she was specifically
[SPEAKER_15]: talking about bat guano.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would say, why don't you broaden
that to just guano in general so we could
[SPEAKER_15]: talk specifically about, say, Jamaica
versus the USA.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are bat guanos that you can get in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was in Colorado at some point,
we actually imported different types of
[SPEAKER_15]: dungs and guanos.
[SPEAKER_15]: Turkey dung, bat guanos, New Zealand dung.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just get a collection of different
fertilizer that you could collect from all
[SPEAKER_15]: around the world, make your own tea brews
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And each person, I think, when they're
creating their own brews or their own
[SPEAKER_15]: living soil, if you will, I think that
maybe what you're asking is, does it go as
[SPEAKER_15]: deep as where you're sourcing the guano
from?
[SPEAKER_15]: So the bats and the diet in which the bat
eats in Jamaica is different than the bats
[SPEAKER_15]: and what they eat and why they eat in the
US, in the different territories.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thus, are they producing a different
type of guano from based on their own
[SPEAKER_15]: environment and how they're digesting
things?
[SPEAKER_15]: And those elements that are in that guano
would naturally be spread to these plants
[SPEAKER_15]: because we're talking about growing
cannabis naturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is what Bubble Man and I
always talk about, about breeding the lion
[SPEAKER_15]: back into the jungle.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when you're talking about varieties
that are cultivated for hundreds of years
[SPEAKER_15]: in their natural environment, then they're
expecting a certain type of phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_15]: a certain type of guano that would be in
that area.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if those bats were doing their job and
they lived in Jamaica and those plants
[SPEAKER_15]: lived there, there might be a certain red
clay and a certain type of guano that
[SPEAKER_15]: combines, that releases a certain type of
immune support, if you will, in the
[SPEAKER_15]: process of that plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think to answer your question about
guano, the answer is yes, I think that
[SPEAKER_15]: each type of guano is environmental-based
or territorial-based and should be looked
[SPEAKER_15]: at for their ecological reasons and why it
was produced and how it was produced.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you can find guano that's old and
aged, it's high in phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's water-soluble and soil-accessible,
whereas normal guano is high in nitrogen
[SPEAKER_13]: and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_15]: The second part is, is there bad guano to
buy out there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Should we not be buying, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there some kind of guano on the market
that we should stick to?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, what I've actually done is I've opened
up a farm for bats, old bats, and I'll be
[SPEAKER_13]: putting up a place where you can trust me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Old batty?
[SPEAKER_12]: The geriatric bat farm, is that what this
is?
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be joining you shortly, but I've got
a few years left, but I'm not that far
[SPEAKER_15]: behind.
[SPEAKER_13]: When they're done pooping and they can't
give no more guano, nobody wants them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Think of the biology in batshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Think of the biology in batshit,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the same as cowshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cowshit, batshit, any type of shit is
going to have organisms, biology,
[SPEAKER_10]: that live inside of an animal's intestine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you take that biology and you put it
into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've looked at this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our microbiologists have looked at this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And is it a regenerative type of biology,
or do you need to keep putting compost tea
[SPEAKER_10]: in all the time?
[SPEAKER_10]: So good soil microorganisms, they should
regenerate on the root.
[SPEAKER_10]: They should grow just by living on the
carbon and the sugars that the root puts
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what saprophytic organisms do.
[SPEAKER_10]: The organisms that are in cowshit and
batshit, you can put them into that
[SPEAKER_10]: sensitive environment and a lot of those
strains are going to die within 30 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just the biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with compost leaf bacteria.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you take a legume and you compost it,
or a big green waste, that's a lot of the
[SPEAKER_10]: potting mediums that everybody uses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Depending if you process it aerobically or
anaerobically, what'll end up happening is
[SPEAKER_10]: those same bacteria that live on the plant
leaf, that's where they're meant to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're meant to live on that plant leaf
and thrive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you put batshit or cowshit and a legume
together, you compost it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're inoculating your soil, again,
with an organic material and also
[SPEAKER_10]: something that may not survive on the root
because they're not necessarily soil
[SPEAKER_10]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're plant microbes or they're animal
intestine microbes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think also what you were saying,
so basically guano affects, I think it'll
[SPEAKER_15]: affect taste.
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll affect a lot of outcomes of the
cannabinoids and terpenes, that's for
[SPEAKER_15]: sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think you were also asking in our
little chat here, if it has environmental
[SPEAKER_15]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the good thing about guano,
as everyone knows, I mean, guano's used in
[SPEAKER_15]: makeup and I mean, so many things.
[SPEAKER_15]: The more bats, the more shit, the more
stuff that can be made.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess the only impact is if we kill out
all the bats or we kill out animals,
[SPEAKER_15]: that produce the guanos, then yeah,
that would be a huge impact on the food
[SPEAKER_15]: source.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think that's an important part
because people go along life and on the
[SPEAKER_15]: planet and they take out large chunks of
say an animal or a fish for food
[SPEAKER_15]: population.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by doing something or hunting
something, you may affect ecologically
[SPEAKER_15]: something else.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you start taking bats out or you
start taking donkeys and you start taking
[SPEAKER_15]: all of the animals that produce these
things, they would have a really profound
[SPEAKER_15]: effect on the food sourcing and how we
cultivated not just this plant,
[SPEAKER_15]: but other plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about the environmental effect of
flying bat shit around the planet on
[SPEAKER_19]: airplanes?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that going to affect things?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, just from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's like one perspective.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think about, okay, so we're mining
all this bat shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of impact are we having on the
geology in that local area?
[SPEAKER_12]: How is it affecting local communities?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are those communities even a part of the
sale of that product or are those
[SPEAKER_12]: communities being exploited?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's also a really big part.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my bigger question is how do we
consciously source these products if we
[SPEAKER_12]: are sourcing them outside of our local
area?
[SPEAKER_20]: Peak phosphorus is kind of part of that
question, you know, because to have
[SPEAKER_20]: phosphorus is to have bat guano is to have
phosphorus and there's other ways of
[SPEAKER_20]: getting phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're getting bat guano locally in
Jamaica from a local cave and it's like
[SPEAKER_20]: the way it's always been, I mean,
you know, that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's totally different.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have a bat farm and you've created
bat houses and you're collecting your own
[SPEAKER_20]: bat shit, that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be more nitrogen rich.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not going to be your phosphorus bat
guano in the same way.
[SPEAKER_20]: And phosphorus bat guano is being
reclassified as soft rock phosphate at
[SPEAKER_20]: this point because it's been sitting in a
cave for so long that it's leached and
[SPEAKER_20]: it's changed its complete form from when
it was, you know, the original bat flying
[SPEAKER_20]: around.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not a renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_20]: The story is old with bat guano.
[SPEAKER_20]: It goes back to the potato famine in
Europe and the beginning of bringing bat
[SPEAKER_20]: guano over on boats together with the
potatoes, organisms crossed pollinated
[SPEAKER_20]: with other food sources on the boat and
then created like this crazy disease that,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, affected, you know, humankind.
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I said before, I mean, you know,
not just bat guano, but other products
[SPEAKER_20]: that have to go far away from country to
country.
[SPEAKER_20]: You never know what happens to it through
customs and duty when it comes to
[SPEAKER_20]: fumigation and sterilization and oh God,
it's not the right microbial cow.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to like heat it up and change it
and every, there's a ton of things that
[SPEAKER_20]: can happen.
[SPEAKER_20]: So local sourcing, always better.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when you're local sourcing,
really, really think about the raw
[SPEAKER_20]: materials and where they came from,
whether they've been sprayed or whether
[SPEAKER_20]: the, if you're taking donkey shit or horse
shit, that's totally different because
[SPEAKER_20]: they're probably eating grass from your
local environment and then shitting it
[SPEAKER_20]: out.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you're getting grass from your
local environment, making compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're only- This is why worms are your
friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: People are like, don't let worms,
like worms are your friends, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I love worms.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't mean to cut you off, I just
wanted to add to it though, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because he's like, he's right on point
talking about the different guanos and
[SPEAKER_15]: what he's saying is if you, if now you're
focused on guanos and you just are focused
[SPEAKER_15]: on that, if you don't get it locally and
have a sustainable source, then yeah,
[SPEAKER_15]: long-term, you know, you could be wiped in
a different direction.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why worms are our friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Worms and bees.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other part of this too, like as a,
as an example is there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_12]: that are, you know, working with bees to
pollinate different fields and different
[SPEAKER_12]: farms.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what they're doing is they're trucking
these bees around and bees naturally,
[SPEAKER_12]: they don't like to move.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where the whole concept of bee line
comes in.
[SPEAKER_12]: If the bee line outside of its own natural
habitation space is disturbed,
[SPEAKER_12]: that bee becomes confused, gets stressed
and eventually will lead to what's called
[SPEAKER_12]: colony collapse.
[SPEAKER_12]: When colony collapse happens, all the bees
die.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when all the bees die- I had that
happen to me by the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: How was that experience for you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably devastating.
[SPEAKER_15]: I opened my door at this new place and
then all of the bees died in front of me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Colony collapse.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like thousands and thousands of bees.
[SPEAKER_15]: I never thought that existed in my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I, I think I told Marcus about
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the craziest thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell us the story around it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us like the backstory.
[SPEAKER_12]: Explain to us your insights on what
happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have like a weird frequency with
insects and animals anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there was like, you know, there was
like thousands of spiders and lots of bees
[SPEAKER_15]: in this house.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then like the bees all died one day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm talking like thousands of bees.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember when the spiders all bit you
and you ended up at the hospital.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and everyone's like, oh yeah,
spiders don't bite.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they bite me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but yeah, seeing like a whole colony
of bees, we're talking like you could
[SPEAKER_15]: shovel like bees.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I had to Google that and I was
like, oh man, what happened here?
[SPEAKER_15]: And like either, like they were talking
about colony collapsing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I started.
[SPEAKER_13]: So spiders, Tony, first they got rid of
the, the bees, then they came after you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say in some, in some indigenous
cultures and in some, um, I don't know in
[SPEAKER_12]: integrative forms of healing is maybe the
way that I want to say it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it is believed that sometimes when you
do get bitten by an insect, especially if
[SPEAKER_12]: it's on one of your meridian points,
it's actually helping to clear energy for
[SPEAKER_12]: you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe those spiders were actually
trying to help.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they got me good and they got rid of
all his meridian points.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like all of them at once at the same time.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there was, there was like,
really?
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but then, uh, speaking of bats,
I will, I will tell you that like,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I could not make this up though,
but, uh, Marcus and I and John Bruffalo
[SPEAKER_15]: were in Jamaica in this little boat house
and tell them what happened, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like how many years have you been around
bats and tell them what?
[SPEAKER_19]: They're off my deck every night at dusk.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've since I've lived in BC, I've been
around bats and before that going to
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamaica and hanging out in the caves and
the rat bats, the fruit bats.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this bat landed on Tony's head.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like, he was just sitting there and
it came and landed on his head.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he was just like, he's like,
what was that?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a, there was a bat.
[SPEAKER_19]: You had a bat on your head.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was just like, what the heck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have radar.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're usually very accurate flyers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, have you, have you ever
seen a bat accidentally fall?
[SPEAKER_15]: Fly into somebody's head accidents.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they have rabies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can get you pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to play with bats and pick
them up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get some guano from him?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you at least, you know, we're able to
cash in a little.
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually it was the bat landed on his
head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I had another comment about what you
guys were talking just now about bees and
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have missed a little bit about it,
but I just wanted to add something about,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, something that could be contributing
to the bee colony collapse, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I think is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the diet of bees is honey and
honey is not just sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not just like, what happens is when
a lot of bee farmers take away the honey
[SPEAKER_01]: or harvest the honey, they give the bees
back sugar or corn syrup as a replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's frustrating with that is honey
is very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use a lot in our facial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, if you look into the
literature, there's some really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting stuff about honey for wound
healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it can help, um, basically wounds
heal faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was looking at this more in terms
of the gut, but this can also help with
[SPEAKER_01]: skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for bees, it would be helping with
wound healing, antioxidant defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another cool thing is honey is
actually a prebiotic fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is it boosts the growth
of good bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when bees are eating their natural
diet of the honey that they're making for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, they're not only getting a
sugar source, they're also getting fibers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are encouraging the growth of good
bacteria that are helping boost the bees
[SPEAKER_01]: natural defense system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when that food source is taken away
from them and it's replaced with corn
[SPEAKER_01]: syrup, it's also very reflective of what's
happening in our Western diet where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking away these natural, um,
holistic foods and replacing it with
[SPEAKER_01]: processed foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results of that is you're more
susceptible to disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's also contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also contributing to part of the
issue why the bees are more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: infections and all of these other things
that are leading to colony collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes back to diet and good
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_15]: And cell phone towers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say they, they also,
uh, respond first and foremost to our
[SPEAKER_15]: electromagnetic balance in frequencies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so when there's a shift or there's a
North and a South shift, um, you might see
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of bees dying too in that process.
[SPEAKER_15]: We hadn't seen that before, but something
to think about, um, they work off of a
[SPEAKER_15]: very interesting pattern in that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, but yeah, maybe the queen bee
died, you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul Stammons spoke about it last time we
were, uh, in Richmond altogether,
[SPEAKER_19]: watching him, uh, kind of break it down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thought it was something,
wasn't there something to do with grizzly
[SPEAKER_19]: bears that were ripping into the trees
that were creating some sort of a fungus
[SPEAKER_19]: that the bees were feeding on that was
giving them this, this flora or fauna that
[SPEAKER_19]: they required.
[SPEAKER_19]: And without it, these mites were attacking
the bees and just sucking all the blood
[SPEAKER_19]: out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Paul is, he has a whole,
uh, mechanism for what's happening and a
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic mechanism, because it's not just
like, we know there's certain things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are affecting the bees, certain,
uh, bad bacteria or fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's been a number of different,
um, pathogens that have been implicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know every once in a while you see a
press release like, this is the cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: the colony collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like everything, it's going to be,
it's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's multifactorial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Paul did a really good job of
explaining some of the complexities to it
[SPEAKER_01]: and that, um, could be the main issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the point I was bringing up was more
just, again, the nutrition of the bee is
[SPEAKER_01]: weakening it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it more susceptible to these
infectious pathogens and similar to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the bees, the ganja honey,
the bees that eat the ganja.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I, I tried some of that honey in
Spain that this guy brought from like the
[SPEAKER_15]: UK.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember I didn't, I was like,
I was like, ah, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've only heard a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it's a real story though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, yeah, what does it taste like
cannabis pollen?
[SPEAKER_19]: It did not.
[SPEAKER_19]: It did not knock Tony out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And generally when he eats things that are
cannabinoid rich, it's not long after
[SPEAKER_19]: that.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's unconscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honey that are there's honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen these documentaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might've been on vice even where
they were traveling and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming the psychedelic honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was from some type of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the blue?
[SPEAKER_19]: This guy claimed that he had that there
was cannabinoids in the honey and that's
[SPEAKER_19]: right.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was not.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the, but the honey that I ate,
it was kind of a honey color.
[SPEAKER_15]: The translucent, but a little bit green in
it, which I thought was interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in chlorophyll or the pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, yeah, definitely some
skeptical reasons to be skeptical there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe he added something green to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and I make a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first thing I was like,
Ooh, yeah, I don't know if the,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if the bees would be pumping
out green colored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, maybe you're not getting
cannabinoids or psychoactive compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but from the cannabis honey, but you could
be very well getting other beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the cannabis honey could have benefits,
but it might not make you high bees on
[SPEAKER_13]: male cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_12]: The bees love the boy plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the, my first season, I had a couple
of my girls turned to boys and it was too
late.
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the bees went to the boys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as much as it's like this huge misnomer
of outdoor growing to have your boy plants
[SPEAKER_13]: always was a boy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pardon.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you said a couple of your girls turned
to boys.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So before they, so they sexed out and a
couple of them turned to boys.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the interesting thing, this is
interesting is to me anyways, is that
[SPEAKER_12]: there was an even pairing of girls to boys
in my garden at that time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was almost like nature new to try
and kind of like balance things out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was totally trippy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have any guilt conscious,
like pulling the males or do you let the
[SPEAKER_15]: males go for the bees?
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly, I let them go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, but I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my garden was so happy for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, it was one of my best seasons
I've had so far just in regards to my
[SPEAKER_12]: vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also Natasha, I wanted to say something
about what you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_16]: how the concentration of either bee pollen
or bee honey, because both of those
[SPEAKER_16]: products are utilized by bees as well to
both make their hive and also sustain them
[SPEAKER_16]: through winter time when there isn't any
pollen.
[SPEAKER_16]: But just like we condense and concentrate
our cannabis and we even actually call it
[SPEAKER_16]: honey or oil, we're concentrating
everything in that plant in the same way
[SPEAKER_16]: that the bees are concentrating their
honey as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: So a big part of collapse is that they're
concentrating a lot of the toxins in our
[SPEAKER_16]: environment as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: The field crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then metacloprid.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry to chime in.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, the colony collapse and stuff
like, you know, the neonicotinoids are
[SPEAKER_11]: doing a big part of that, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, and, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why you're growing an
environment.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're trying to support the whole bees.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're sitting here right here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Bees are eating our St. John's wort
flowers and our dill flowers and our
[SPEAKER_20]: burdock flowers and carrot flowers.
[SPEAKER_20]: They have multi different flowers to eat
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the bees also get to, they get
affected by cell phone towers and
[SPEAKER_20]: vibrational.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Vibrational pressures coming in.
[SPEAKER_20]: So bees are under attack.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's a part of our
certification with the peer certification
[SPEAKER_20]: is to have bee gardens and to have flowers
on your property, anywhere on your
[SPEAKER_20]: property, just to support your
environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the flowers that I have growing in
our garden is borage bees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love borage.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's this beautiful, edible, wild,
amazing plant that just thrives.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's totally a weed, but it's,
it's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found that for my garden anyways,
it seems to attract all the right
[SPEAKER_12]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_12]: So consider that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus you can take the little ever blooming
purpley blue flowers and put them in your
[SPEAKER_12]: salad.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're so delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have this little gentle sweet note to
them.
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as Paul's statements goes,
it's really interesting to, to make a note
[SPEAKER_20]: about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: With bee collapse, because colony collapse
has been huge among hive holders that
[SPEAKER_20]: people that have had hives for 35 years,
you know, all of a sudden lost like three
[SPEAKER_20]: quarters of their hives, you know,
last year alone in one year, just huge
[SPEAKER_20]: collapse.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, um, with, uh, forget the guy's name,
but it was in Eastern Washington,
[SPEAKER_20]: Steve, something, uh, anyway, Paul's
statements together with him did tests on
[SPEAKER_20]: how to support the bees and support their
immune system.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they used polypores.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, the red belted polypore grows on trees
around here.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of the most widespread polypores
in North America and the world.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, they made an extract from that
polypore and put it in, uh, for as a food
[SPEAKER_20]: source for the bees and their beehives and
really completely made a huge difference
[SPEAKER_20]: on their, um, made a huge difference on
their colonies and brought their,
[SPEAKER_20]: uh, um, their, their highs back to life.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was really an amazing success.
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, and also when we study the
polypores, we're realizing that the
[SPEAKER_16]: polypores hold a tremendous value to our
human existence for health and wellbeing
[SPEAKER_16]: as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we've been talking about Rishi
for 5,000 years, as far as texts go of
[SPEAKER_16]: ancient Chinese medicine and beyond that,
you know, even to the hieroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but we can, we're just now starting to
put that into science and looking at talk
[SPEAKER_16]: about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoa, there's an incredible amount of
terpenes that are in mushrooms to study
[SPEAKER_16]: the polypores is to go down a whole new
wormhole.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just starting to stack terpenes on top of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're learning that, um, that actually
is incredibly helpful to our own immune
[SPEAKER_16]: response.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were, and Paul sort of introduced
that, um, technology and those sort of
[SPEAKER_16]: ideas and the science of how it can help
us and put it into the bees.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why we feel really good about
combining polypore medicine with cannabis
[SPEAKER_20]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_20]: When we make oils and, and extracts from
cannabis, combining the two is an amazing,
[SPEAKER_20]: amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: Amazing addition together.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't do any concentrations really
without utilizing, um, medicinal mushrooms
[SPEAKER_16]: as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: We feel like they just go together like
peanut butter and jelly.
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of our favorite products to do is
take, um, fresh ganja flowers and submerge
[SPEAKER_20]: it in raw honey.
[SPEAKER_20]: Take fresh ganja flowers, put it in like a
gallon jar of raw honey and soak it in the
[SPEAKER_20]: honey and turn it upside down to where the
flowers rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe twice a day you flip it and the
good flowers for about three months,
[SPEAKER_20]: you can do it as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to keep it in there for a
long time, but the, um, honey extracts and
[SPEAKER_20]: kind of melts the, the, uh, the resin and
the terpenes into the honey and makes an
[SPEAKER_20]: amazing extract.
[SPEAKER_20]: The terpenes get preserved into the honey
and it's super fabulous and amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a good THCA because it's a raw
version of it as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all your raw cannabinoids in the
honey and you can, you can put it in tea
[SPEAKER_20]: and activate it, or you can make super
foods, spirulina, raw cacao, um,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, honey balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: What color is that when you're done with
it?
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same color, but it's more cloudy
because it has resin trichomes in it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can really see the trichomes in it
too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it tastes just like raw flowers.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got some of that amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some of that amazing dragonfly
earth medicine mushroom infused goodness
[SPEAKER_11]: right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was gifted to me by the legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm about to put some in my,
my eggs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the honey extracts, is it green
colored or is it a gold colored?
[SPEAKER_13]: What color is it?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gold, but you know, if you,
if one of our strains has really lavender
[SPEAKER_16]: terpenes, the really lavender colored
terpenes are 840, which is like an African
[SPEAKER_16]: based strain.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, it makes them it almost like a
purpley hue when you look at it in the
[SPEAKER_16]: sunlight in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: It would matter a little bit on the strain
for sure.
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's a lot of times it's more
goldish and not as much green.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not as much, you know, fresh flowers
as you possibly can into the raw honey.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really a beautiful flavor.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can use it raw in anything.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been actually drinking hash water.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we utilized our hash water.
[SPEAKER_16]: We added CO2 to the hash water,
raw and cold.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then added the honey extract into that
with a drop of vanilla.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's been like sparkling water,
sparkling, acidic, cannabinoid water.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever tested the cannabis flowers
after you process them with honey to see
[SPEAKER_13]: if anything was left in them?
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we haven't, but it's really obvious
when you strain them out and then you put
[SPEAKER_16]: them on like a, a screen for many days.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it takes a long time for the honey
to come out of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_16]: It takes a long time in the straining
process.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're really crunchy as if there's
nothing left.
[SPEAKER_16]: As if the honey sucked out all of the
aqueous compounds as well as all the oily
[SPEAKER_16]: compounds of the flower.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like crunchy and nothing left of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never, never done that with honey.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm quite curious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna have to try that this year for
sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys should get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can send you some and you could taste
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause we infuse ours for like three to six
months.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have a large supply of honey.
So,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the question though,
is it clean honey?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the one I have is it's called Manuka
honey from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's amazing honey, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Super antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be one of the world's
topest quality, most expensive,
[SPEAKER_13]: not for flavor and taste, but for
medicinal quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that might be a good one to play with.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, does, does Sid have that one?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not be surprised.
[SPEAKER_13]: He seems like the type.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob brought this and gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause, cause Sid has quite a collection of
honeys and I'll never forget after a
[SPEAKER_19]: Legends of Hash him giving me a scoop full
of honey that just took away the raw sore
[SPEAKER_19]: throat I had from smoking that hubbly
bubbly for like an hour.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just even being in that building with that
hubbly bubbly was like minor smoke
[SPEAKER_19]: inhalation.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like being in a house fire and not
leaving.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that, that honey oat, man,
I'll tell you just one spoonful.
[SPEAKER_19]: The second it touched my throat,
I was like, I could puff again right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, next time just bring a gallon of it
with you and you can eat a spoonful every
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought maybe we would create a hubbly
bubbly that had a small straw in it that
[SPEAKER_19]: released a drop of it with every big pull
on the pipe.
[SPEAKER_19]: We could do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You probably patented that already.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not even going to ask.
[SPEAKER_19]: So someone did have a question for you,
Peter, that was like literally 35 minutes
[SPEAKER_19]: ago, but I didn't want to break up the
conversation, but it was whether or not
[SPEAKER_19]: these bacteria and soil balance can help
combat root pests like root aphids,
[SPEAKER_19]: fungus gnats, maybe even ants.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they got lots of ants in places
like Jamaica and California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, there's an interesting dynamic and
I just learned this in sustainable
[SPEAKER_10]: agriculture when I was, when I was doing a
lot of work in there with some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: agronomists and whatnot for, for those
types of situations.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, so let's talk about aphids.
[SPEAKER_10]: So have you guys ever seen, um,
uh, predator, you know, that movie with
[SPEAKER_10]: long sports nigga and predators there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a good image for aphids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about how the predator sees,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: He sees in heat signatures.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of how an aphid sees as an
aphid is cruising over a field to look
[SPEAKER_10]: down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the macro micronutrient balance
within that leaf is not perfectly
[SPEAKER_10]: balanced, the plant will, will kind of
have a, uh, a heat signature on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where the aphid will be
attracted to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a weakness within the plant,
within its, its, its.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, it's like the healthy lions
seeing, seeing the small sick baby will be
[SPEAKER_19]: limping at the back of the, at the back of
the pack.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's like, Oh shit, we are still going
to consume that right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's savage.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is so savage.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's savage, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all these little aphid fuckers see this
core defenseless little plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: man, they didn't have the right amount of
calcium nurturing or boron nurturing or
[SPEAKER_10]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so these guys, yeah, they just cruise
in and they'll just invest that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll even make like a little hole.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the insects around where that
plant didn't get the right amount.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you actually are able to get a
perfect balance of nutrients in the,
[SPEAKER_10]: in, in the soil that the plant can uptake
appropriately, what ends up happening is
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant emanates an ultraviolet
frequency.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a light.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like so bright that when that aphid
is cruising over, instead of seeing like
[SPEAKER_10]: red radiation, like the predator sees,
see it's like blinded.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, Holy shit, I can't even look at
that plant cause it's so fucking bright.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got this amazing beam coming off of
it and it naturally makes the bug cruise
[SPEAKER_10]: away.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, every year we get an
opportunity, which I always see as an
[SPEAKER_16]: opportunity to deal with like a different
pathogen of some sort.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's like when you live on a
farm, there's always something every year
[SPEAKER_16]: there's different flushes of different
things.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we noticed that it's around
everywhere and this is the year of the
[SPEAKER_16]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've had this wonderful, amazing
opportunity to go down the intelligence
[SPEAKER_16]: and understanding aphids.
[SPEAKER_20]: And not root aphids, plant aphids,
and it's local in the environment all over
[SPEAKER_20]: the place and different, you know,
plants, you just hit the mountain tops and
[SPEAKER_20]: there's all the fireweed is covered in
aphids.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It just seems like this is the year of the
aphid and the entire environment,
[SPEAKER_16]: not just our farm is feeling a lot of
aphids.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have been really looking at what
plants have the aphids, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: we, we look at our soil biology underneath
a microscope and everything looks really
[SPEAKER_16]: good.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got a good equal balance of fungi
and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our plants are really thriving everywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one, you know, plant that might
get it, you know, and I've always thought,
[SPEAKER_16]: well, if something's missing in that
plant, you know, I really need to up
[SPEAKER_16]: something or it's not uptaking something
and it doesn't maybe have, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: that ultraviolet light of health and
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we got a refractometer a while ago and
now we're starting to bricks test plants
[SPEAKER_16]: and we're looking at, you know,
the bricks test of particular plants and
[SPEAKER_16]: ones that maybe aphids have attacked more
or ones that they decide that they're
[SPEAKER_16]: going to breed on because I don't know if
you all know, but aphids are actually
[SPEAKER_16]: clones of themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're born pregnant.
[SPEAKER_20]: They have pregnant babies.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have pregnant babies.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're a single clone of themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they don't need a male or female at
all.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are all looking for big aliens in
the sky.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just all over the board.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're here.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, um, which is good though, cause you
can affect two generations when you affect
[SPEAKER_20]: them, the one that, you know, the mother,
you know, whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've had this great opportunity of
looking at all of the different things,
[SPEAKER_16]: what aphids are respond to or what they
don't respond to with different plants,
[SPEAKER_16]: different sprays, heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been going on and on with that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And through the bricks testing,
we've actually found that, um,
[SPEAKER_16]: the ones, the plants that are getting more
of the aphids and they're breeding on are
[SPEAKER_16]: the ones that have the much higher bricks
level.
[SPEAKER_16]: The ones that are actually the healthiest
ones in the gardens are the ones that the
[SPEAKER_16]: aphids are going to first, which sort of
takes away all of what I thought before
[SPEAKER_16]: and what we're talking about now,
which I still think has amazing,
[SPEAKER_16]: great value.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but they are definitely choosing the
healthiest plants in the garden.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or the ones that appear the healthiest by
the bricks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's important to realize
that all of these things are relative.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Peter was talking about
earlier, you know, what we see is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be determined by the evolutionary genetics
of the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have natural aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have natural microbes in
the soil that might be harmful or
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plant's ability, how it interacts
with them is going to have a lot to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with its long-term genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it evolve to be able to deal
with?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are its natural defenses?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of terpenes aren't exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's natural signals to the world
around them to attract certain types of
[SPEAKER_05]: bugs, to, to, you know, avoid certain
types of bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that we can control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of that we can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the groups that we're working
with at the Colladrius Network,
[SPEAKER_05]: is Eleanor Coats and Karen Bentley's
project at the Kandor Herbarium Project.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're two PhDs out of UCLA, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they're doing is starting to
essentially build a traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: science-based herbarium out of cannabis,
where they're getting people to donate,
[SPEAKER_05]: not donate, but a few grams that they will
then press of fresh flower, along with
[SPEAKER_05]: surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: For what was their elevation, what
practices were used, and things like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that they can start to narrow down
which strains are working best in which
[SPEAKER_05]: environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's, in 10, 20 years,
as we get the ability to do more of this
[SPEAKER_05]: science and really narrow down some of the
lineage of these strains, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start to look back on some of the strains
we're trying to grow in certain
[SPEAKER_05]: geographical areas and say, well,
no wonder we always had these problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just not best adapted to thrive in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order for us to force them to
thrive, we've gone to using practices over
[SPEAKER_05]: the last few years that now we're all
trying to get away from and go to a more
[SPEAKER_05]: healthier way of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that takes understanding which plants
do well in which geographical areas,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is going to affect how they interact
with the soil, the livid soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: the rhizome, and the bugs in their area,
everything from powder and mildew and so
[SPEAKER_05]: on, has to do with how they interact in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that their work is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody who wants to participate in that,
I can definitely get in touch with them as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's exactly what we were talking about
is it's looking at the environment as a
[SPEAKER_16]: healthy thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not just separating the plant or the
soil or the microbes.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's looking at the entire terroir,
the entire picture, which I think,
[SPEAKER_16]: yeah, which is just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is such a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you guys were talking about and what
Natasha was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Natasha had something about
self-regulating nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she was asking, as far as
fertilization, how much is too much iron,
[SPEAKER_10]: for instance, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had a conversation that the biology
is actually enzymatically communicating
[SPEAKER_10]: with the rhizosphere to be able to
disclose to it how much iron we should
[SPEAKER_10]: have, how little iron that particular
plant needs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you interrelate that deep,
like you were saying, Joshua, the
[SPEAKER_10]: homeopathic approach, the natural,
the homeopathic approach, that perfect
[SPEAKER_10]: system, which is naturally communicating
with the amounts of nutrients that that
[SPEAKER_10]: particular plant needs, then it can
interrelate to the aphids and what you
[SPEAKER_10]: guys are seeing within the bricks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that in and of itself, that natural
system with the biology effectively
[SPEAKER_10]: communicating with that root will give you
the balance of nutrients that you need
[SPEAKER_10]: within your leaf tissue to be able to help
naturally with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not saying that the product is a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not disclosing that or claiming that
here, but just... And silica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And silica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love, Joshua, that you're smoking a
joint right now, like a good long joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excited about that for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm about to puff another bowl.
[SPEAKER_19]: I started Hash Church off strong today and
I've kind of been like just getting into
[SPEAKER_19]: the conversation, listening to everyone
talk and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, I miss Darren's bong rip.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess I'll have to say it for him.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bong rip, mother lubbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pack it up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hit it up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever way you got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that institute or that project
that kind of the whole environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: project that was just being discussed?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the CANDOR, C-A-N-N.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, am I muted?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the CANDOR Herbarium project.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're traveling all over the country now
taking samples, but it's Eleanor Coons and
[SPEAKER_05]: Karen Bentley.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're amazingly brilliant women who are
running this project.
[SPEAKER_11]: C-A-N-N-D-O-R Herbarium.
[SPEAKER_11]: Herbarium project.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Herbarium has those herbalists who are
watching will recognize that term is a
[SPEAKER_05]: real way to identify certain strains of
plants in a way that is uniform across an
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, whether it be mint or basil or
what have you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of that project is really
identifying from the old school industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: people have been growing strains for
generations and generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, what is X?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as we all know with the
hybridization and everyone's breeding on
[SPEAKER_05]: their own, it's hard sometimes to identify
what is what.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they're working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really going back to old school
breeders and longtime lineage.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have been working with lineages for
years and years and years and narrowing
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is, say, you know, gorilla glue?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what are all its variations
within that genetic family?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it through seed and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have this genetic barrier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're working on all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But while they're doing that, they're
collecting geographical information,
[SPEAKER_05]: all other sort of scientific data as far
as how it's being used, what are they
[SPEAKER_05]: doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then see how that plant expresses
itself differently in these different
[SPEAKER_05]: areas, along with what is it susceptible
to and is it successful to start to narrow
[SPEAKER_05]: down where they thrive the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as we are getting back to what
Peter and others were saying, when we
[SPEAKER_05]: start to see that, we're going to start to
see correlations with their evolutionary
[SPEAKER_05]: lineage as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants out of Afghanistan versus other
areas, how they respond to the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to start to see
that really define itself better.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it will give us the ability to then
plan appropriately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where am I?
[SPEAKER_05]: What zone am I in?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is appropriate for my
geographical area to not have to worry
[SPEAKER_05]: about some of the pitfalls of trying to
make plants reach their full potential in
[SPEAKER_05]: areas that's just not they're not designed
to work well in?
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that would be easier for people to
understand forest once clear places have
[SPEAKER_19]: uncovered themselves as clearly superior.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I go back always to lavender.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it does tend to grow really great in
one particular place in France.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it seems to be the most commercially
successful because of the terpene
[SPEAKER_19]: expression that is allowed in that
particular environment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a feeling we'll see it with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's try again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just got to keep your mic muted when
you're not talking and we'll have no
[SPEAKER_19]: problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now it's not muted.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, to me, to me, one of the most
trippy kind of things about all this is
[SPEAKER_11]: it's so fascinating how kind of regulation
on cannabis is about to be so strong,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, with regards to things like
pesticide testing and how much it's truly
[SPEAKER_11]: going to bring to surface, you know,
these certain geographical constraints
[SPEAKER_11]: about how it might not actually be able to
be possible to grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: this quality and this consistency of urban
certain areas where, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's massive equal, equal 20 being
deployed from planes from neighboring
[SPEAKER_11]: farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and it's it's so fascinating,
like on the Michael Paul and botany desire
[SPEAKER_11]: and like the secret life of plants type
level just about this plant intelligence
[SPEAKER_11]: and how much, you know, kind of how much
of the most, you know, pioneering and kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of leading kind of research around how to,
you know, mimic nature and recreate the
[SPEAKER_11]: like perfection around us to like,
as the only essential way forward,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and so it's almost going to,
it seems to me like it's almost the
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation of cannabis is almost going to
inadvertently, you know, really kind of,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, we've talked about this a little
bit before, but just, I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_11]: going to inadvertently support and
reinforce the whole slow food movement
[SPEAKER_11]: ideals of knowing your farmer and where
it's coming from, you know, terror and
[SPEAKER_11]: really starting to get into the car
realities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, you know, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then with, with, with, you know,
perfect balance of microbes and,
[SPEAKER_11]: and, you know, predatory nematodes and
everything to keep away the bugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what, what the ability to
produce optimal terpene production,
[SPEAKER_11]: what certain terpene might offer,
you know, more significantly mothers and
[SPEAKER_11]: anyone plants are under attack.
[SPEAKER_11]: What terpenes might show up in significant
amount, you know, just from being under
[SPEAKER_10]: attack, but sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You brought in the secret life of plants,
uh, to that whole, uh, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that interconnect, I love,
I love, uh, I like that you brought in the
[SPEAKER_10]: secret life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of plants and that whole
interconnectedness that we share with our
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: That, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was, I was, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's, you know, for what it's worth,
actually, I was our last time I was in a
[SPEAKER_11]: house church.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it was, it was, uh, like about a month
ago, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, right before I was, uh, doing the last
day of chalice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was really funny because,
uh, you know, from a plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, you know, sparked like one of the
strongest moments of clarity and companies
[SPEAKER_11]: I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was so deeply around intelligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plants, us being stewards of these
plants into this new world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, it's amazing how much we,
you know, when we're embodied by this
[SPEAKER_11]: plant, these plants, these plants,
spirits, you know, kind of consumes us in
[SPEAKER_11]: so many ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: The elementals, the elementals that are
like telling us like, you gotta care for
[SPEAKER_10]: this earth, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, you didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care of it, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heal it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's what they're telling.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool that you tuned into that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And big ups to Astro.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just so amazing that there's this
space and such quality, amazing human
[SPEAKER_11]: beings that are sharing this awareness
because it's just like so deeply,
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like, uh, just vibing deep through
the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it might, you know,
I think, uh, the plants are going to help
[SPEAKER_11]: us change the world quicker than we're
going to figure out how to change the
[SPEAKER_11]: world as people because we're going to
plug it up otherwise.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and also if you compare it to like,
uh, other industries, I went to the,
[SPEAKER_15]: this vineyard the other day and it was
funny how they pitched their wine because
[SPEAKER_15]: they said, well, I said, is this organic?
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, yeah, this one's organic.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, has this one been tested for
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_15]: He looked at me kind of funny and he goes,
well, this is on an organic farm,
[SPEAKER_15]: but there's other farms that spray
pesticides close by.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're like, I can't really guarantee
this one's not.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, well, do you have a wine
that is?
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're like, well, yes, there is one
area that is grown that doesn't get fly by
[SPEAKER_15]: that is also organic and tested for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll, and granted we're not smoking
wine.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're digesting it, but a lot of people
don't realize literally all the foods that
[SPEAKER_15]: they eat and things that they think
they're escaping.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of pesticides being spread
around in the food community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, that's because, uh, you know,
we've gone from a nation of farmers to
[SPEAKER_15]: about 4%.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, uh, it's not easy to have all of
this information and knowledge,
[SPEAKER_15]: just like there's not a lot of doctors or
just not a lot of botanists.
[SPEAKER_15]: Chemists and people that are fascinated by
the plant, dedicate their whole life to
[SPEAKER_15]: it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think there's a shift now in
farming, just in foods that I think
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis will help support that because
we're going to start to set a different
[SPEAKER_15]: standard for our medicine and our plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it'll be, I think it'll also,
like you said, open and push more doors
[SPEAKER_15]: for other industries.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, because I think they've gotten lazy
and, uh, dependent too much on,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, chemicals.
[SPEAKER_15]: To help them get through their crops,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's, it's, it's, it's a kind of,
uh, you know, an evolution of the green
[SPEAKER_11]: revolution ideals, you know, the,
what was promised, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_11]: green revolution and, and what it actually
created was an incredibly toxified
[SPEAKER_11]: environment, which, you know, now is,
I think through cannabis going to,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, kind of uproot the whole kind of
foundation of it is, it's like,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, as people are kind of demanding
more clean cannabis and realizing that
[SPEAKER_11]: they don't want to smoke pesticides or
hopefully can also look into, yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like how much wine has Eagle 20 in
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's a back to the evening.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a quick question about the wine
cultivation in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could cannabis and wine be grown together?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like from what I've understood,
they have really similar nutrition
[SPEAKER_12]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Any insights on that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, could they potentially be companion
plants and like, what about exploring that
[SPEAKER_12]: as an industry wine?
[SPEAKER_13]: The best wines are actually, are actually
grown in pretty rocky deprived soils that,
[SPEAKER_13]: that, and they clip back the, uh,
the, the, the wine grapes so that they
[SPEAKER_13]: produce less grapes, but superior quality
grapes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they, there might be some areas where
it's similar, but in general, I think wine
[SPEAKER_13]: appreciates minimal fertilization.
[SPEAKER_13]: I never hear people fertilizing wine in a
particular area to grow more grapes.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's never the goal.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always less better grapes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause they didn't have prohibition to
contend to see, I wonder if cannabis could
[SPEAKER_19]: get onto that, uh, onto that sort of
platform and escape.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause no matter how hard cannabis has
tried to escape from prohibition,
[SPEAKER_19]: it just seemingly is trapped by it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, Oh, we're going to,
you know, we'll show them, we'll keep
[SPEAKER_19]: growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't let them win.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like suddenly all the long flowering
cultivar cultivars are cut out because,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, the prohibition causes the
greed, which causes the, how much can I
[SPEAKER_19]: get and how fast can I get it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Which cuts out long flowering cultivars,
which cuts out exotic, uh, terpene
[SPEAKER_19]: expressions, which cuts out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, happy people because those beautiful
long flowering cultivars.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're worth it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're so delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're so me too.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're so uplifting.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to bring it back to what we were
saying, I think you have a really good
[SPEAKER_05]: point because the more apt the plant is
for the environment is being grown in,
[SPEAKER_05]: the less external fertilizer or help is
necessary for it to reach those
[SPEAKER_05]: potentials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to tie it back to what we were
talking about before, I think you're
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's in what is appropriate for
the environments that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: grown in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to find them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fertilizer is necessary.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good point for dab there, Tony.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm making a, um, I'm making a
signature series.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm making a plated hash church dab,
like more of like an artistic.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're taking this shit seriously
seriously.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll show you what I'm making.
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I'm done with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's he got there?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that a peyote?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's grafted, grafted onto a little blue
or, uh, or some blue flame cactus,
[SPEAKER_09]: a little mini cactus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that big guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: All your little friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: All my friends.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You ever seen those San Pedro's flower?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this, this little button starting
to, it's a, during the day it opens up
[SPEAKER_11]: like the San Pedro flowers are so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're rare though.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, they don't happen very often.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big ones that come off the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: And San Pedro flowers smell exactly like
demons chewing gum.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like demons, demons, demons chewing gum.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's frighteningly how similar they are.
[SPEAKER_19]: I, uh, I've only seen a flowering one one
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: My friend who gave me my peyote buttons,
uh, geez, I'd say close to 15,
[SPEAKER_19]: 16 years ago, he's been growing peyote in
San Pedro for 50 plus years.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's in his late eighties and he's got a
beautiful flowering San Pedro plant when I
[SPEAKER_19]: was at his place on Vancouver Island that
he said he hadn't seen it in some
[SPEAKER_19]: ridiculous amount of time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know Beeman's chewing gum?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And did it smell like Beeman's chewing
gum?
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't put the two together cause I
don't remember really even smelling it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was mostly taking pictures and it was
the plant was like, the cactus was like 12
[SPEAKER_19]: feet tall or 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, it was taller than I could reach
without standing up on a, on a chair.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I've seen tremendously.
[SPEAKER_13]: Largely large San Pedro plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've also seen them flowered many,
many times, many, many different places,
[SPEAKER_13]: different countries, but I really enjoy
the smell of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the next time I see a San Pedro
flower, uh, I'm going to stick my face in
[SPEAKER_19]: it deep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: See if you can find some San, some
Beeman's chewing gum.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know if they still have it,
but I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: It goes back to, uh, you know,
what Chimera said months ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once, once we know these profiles,
I mean, particular terpenes are just so
[SPEAKER_19]: much easier to describe what something is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's what's so cool too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's since we're all so kind of
impassioned by this plant and really take
[SPEAKER_11]: pride in knowing the smell, you know,
just that further bit of information about
[SPEAKER_11]: what terpenes, the accommodation of
terpenes just really elevates your whole
[SPEAKER_11]: game to a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, I have a question because I'm,
I'm kind of new to terpenes myself,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't studied it as much and maybe,
maybe to answer this for me, cause I know
[SPEAKER_10]: they're PhDs with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, um, so, so when we're,
when we get the biology really,
[SPEAKER_10]: really high, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we set the biology off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we're seeing is like nine,
nine types of turkey, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But it really high levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I still don't really know what that
means.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of our growers are coming in and
listening, like instead of four terpenes,
[SPEAKER_10]: we've got like nine types all over like a
certain milligram, pretty high.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like, we used to have just mercy
and mercy was really high.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had, uh, you know, little all in that
one was high.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had like two or three that were
high, but the other ones were micro doses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now when we, with biology and it
doesn't have to be with our product,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not just trying to sell our product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying, let's say if you put in a
ton of like compost tea or, or some
[SPEAKER_10]: product that has a high biology,
a high amount of bacteria, if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: getting nine or more types of terpenes all
at high levels, all extremely balanced,
[SPEAKER_10]: what, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first of all, if they're only
getting nine terpenes, then, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: so you need wider testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think he's saying they're only
getting nine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, when you look at,
I don't have a logical explanation for
[SPEAKER_13]: that because terpene production is
produced by the synthases available.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, I, I can understand how you can
across the board, increase the terpene
[SPEAKER_13]: content with, you know, better roots and a
better health for the plant and more
[SPEAKER_13]: resin, but, uh, but to alter the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that usually happens when you,
you know, grow it in too cold of a too hot
[SPEAKER_13]: of an area where the, some of the more
volatile monitor beans get evaporated.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I, I, I, I, I, I, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how the results were
formulated, but, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different things that
could be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sorry to clarify, my PhD was not
studying terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was studying vitamin D, uh, in the gut,
but, um, I knew about terpenes through my
[SPEAKER_01]: work, uh, formulating topicals and working
with other plants, uh, extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm also just learning about the
different, um, chemistry pathways of how
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and terpenoids are actually
formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but some points that I wanted to bring
up, um, was there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that could be influencing terpene
production and some things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting and bringing it back to also
the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's a lot of literature
looking at affecting, uh, environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: control, such as heat, such as
temperature, such as, um, UV exposure and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that can, um, alter the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene profile and improve the taste of
grapes, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So presumably the same thing would be
happening in cannabis and affecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the terpene expression through
modulating the different, uh, ultraviolet
[SPEAKER_01]: rays.
[SPEAKER_13]: They do it with berries in the Netherlands
in greenhouses that transmit UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, exactly, UVB, especially,
especially, and there's some trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with, um, tomatoes also where
they're specifically using UVB exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, improve the flavor and the sensory
profile of tomatoes, um, which we can link
[SPEAKER_01]: it back to the terpenes and changing the
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you were saying, Sam, about,
um, heat can evaporate some terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's also true and can shift
the terpenes this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but bringing it back to the bacteria
and maybe how the soil, the soil microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: shifts could be modulating these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this could be through a number of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first off, it could be changing the
synthase, uh, expression in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's been shown in other plants,
so presumably that could be happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you brought, um, this point up a
little bit before, Peter, where you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that some microbes also produce,
uh, terpenes and other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so potentially the microbes that
you're feeding the plants could be making
[SPEAKER_01]: residual terpenes and perhaps some of
those terpenes could be getting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and not just the, um, terps that
the plants plant is synthesizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but perhaps there's some residual terpenes
from the microbes, but I think that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be very low levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major terpenes you would be seeing
would definitely be from the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: First strain plant is going to have like,
like high and little.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if, so, so that's what I've,
so some of the strains, the plant strains
[SPEAKER_10]: that, that are coming after us,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're saying, oh, normally we get normal
mercy levels really high, but now we're
[SPEAKER_10]: not only getting really high mercy at what
we were getting other ways, but we're also
[SPEAKER_10]: getting really high level, like super high
as high and higher than my nursing was
[SPEAKER_10]: before that's what created the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and on that, on that, uh,
on that note, uh, Peter, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: from, from testing kind of, you know,
some interesting insights that we see and
[SPEAKER_11]: have drawn, um, you know, definitely,
you know, involve UV light.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, you know, you, the same strains kind
of grown, you know, indoor under high
[SPEAKER_11]: pressure sodium or metal halide or any
type of lighting, which is completely
[SPEAKER_11]: deficient in UVA, B or C, you know,
as opposed to plants grown under the sun
[SPEAKER_11]: with UV spectrums, you know, the wide full
full UV spectrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we, we have seen certain,
uh, secondary and tertiary terpenes,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, you know, express in, in, in more
prime or in more co-dominant or primary
[SPEAKER_11]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and it's a, it's definitely a pretty
fascinating site.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can imagine that, um, you know,
microbiology soil, like the soil
[SPEAKER_11]: microbiome would, would absolutely in some
way contribute hugely as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, um, um, you know, and then to
Sam, something you were mentioning
[SPEAKER_11]: earlier, cause you know, we test for like
34.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's a shame.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we lose that was like, no,
and 34, but that's a major step in the
[SPEAKER_13]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, uh, 20 years ago, we were testing for
over just over 50, uh, of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's how many standards we,
we had in house at that time using GCF ID.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: The more you test for it, the better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sam, Sam, if I may jump back and,
uh, finish that point, um, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we test, we test, we're currently testing
for 34 terpenes and yeah, there's tons of
[SPEAKER_11]: more turbines that can be tested for,
but from what we've seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, 10,000 plus samples that we've
done, you know, data analysis on,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, to, you know, data aggregate kind of,
you're probably finding 99% of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, well, and that's what's really
fascinating is that pretty much there's
[SPEAKER_11]: about nine terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's about, you know, I mean,
of the 34 we're testing for, there's
[SPEAKER_11]: really ever about nine that ever show up
in any primary, secondary, tertiary
[SPEAKER_11]: amount.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, uh, and, and so, and then
whenever it comes down to like primary or
[SPEAKER_11]: co-dominant amounts, you know,
there's only about five.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you say 10 major ones and a half
dozen, uh, co-dominant or minor ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, uh, but I I'm convinced all those
other ones play a part.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, significant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and that's, and that's what's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I'm, you know, my, one of my
business partners at SC labs has a really
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting way of kind of putting,
uh, you know, cause, cause it's terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: are so kind of unknown to how much,
you know, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like kind of a mixture kind of soup,
you know, cause it's like, if you take a
[SPEAKER_11]: pinch of salt and add it to a soup,
you know, it's going to nominally affect
[SPEAKER_11]: the overall flavor or taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you, but if you take, but if you
take, but if you take a similar pinch of
[SPEAKER_11]: cumin, you know, and you just turned the
whole thing into cumin soup, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: so it's like, if there's like,
you know, the tiniest amount of like
[SPEAKER_11]: eucalyptol or balancing or some weird like
Borneol or like whatever that don't really
[SPEAKER_11]: ever show up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It might really substantially actually
tested varieties in the past.
[SPEAKER_13]: We consistently found more than 50
different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not saying that we're only testing
for like four or five, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're, they're testing at SC labs for a
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're getting the 35 package,
but that's probably the biggest one in the
[SPEAKER_10]: field that I know of.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the co-dominant, see, I'm still
learning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to wrap my head around.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the co-dominant are like the top,
like five.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so, so kind of, um, you know,
and, and, and, you know, and, and Sam,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you, you definitely, you know,
in the last conversation too, I mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, I mean, biggest ups to, you know,
Mark Lewis, phytoprant, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: so much of, uh, you know, our insight just
into, into, into how, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: how we were able to like kind of come and
take approach and just look at our data,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, was so much, you know,
found it off of that work, but you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, what's, yeah, what's, what's amazing
kind of about that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we, we see, you know, it's, it's almost
like the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, like of the rainbow, you know,
and, and on one side, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: on one side of the spectrum, you know,
you have turpinoline and then the other
[SPEAKER_11]: side of it, which is like Jack train wreck
sage, Durbin, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the other spectrum of the
rainbow, you have like near seen pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: much predominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and in those groups, typically it's
the, the, the entire class of strains that
[SPEAKER_11]: are in each one of those groups are
typically predominantly one terpene that
[SPEAKER_11]: makes up, you know, like 75 plus percent
of the total terpene content, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you have these secondary tertiary
terpenes, you know, like awesome mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: and like, you know, beta carophylene and
you have to paneling and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, in, in these different
groups, primary groups where they're,
[SPEAKER_11]: they express in some small, some small
secondary tertiary amount, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: which, which make up sub groupings within
a primary group.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then, you know, so, so, but then,
you know, everything in the middle is
[SPEAKER_11]: really interesting because it's not
necessarily one primary terpene,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it's, it's like a combination of
like three to five.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and so, so it's like, you know,
we see it's in, in so much of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_11]: of the rainbow in the middle, you know,
um, you know, it's, it's, it's a typically
[SPEAKER_11]: limonene near seen beta carophylene prime
in, in, in like, in almost, in almost like
[SPEAKER_11]: balanced codon and then, and then,
and then a little little and humaline,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, exactly what you're saying,
because when we were doing this work back
[SPEAKER_13]: in 2000, the first thing I said,
but we, we realized that terpenes were
[SPEAKER_13]: both modifying and potentiating THC,
for example, or at least some of the
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes do.
[SPEAKER_13]: We, we were really, really shocked by the,
the, the number of different combinations
[SPEAKER_13]: of profiles of terpenes, both in amounts
and whether they're there or not,
[SPEAKER_13]: because there's 150 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's millions and different
combinations.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we instantly said, well, now we
understand why there can be so many
[SPEAKER_13]: different effects found in cannabis,
even though the cannabinoids don't get too
[SPEAKER_13]: high, except for THC and well,
CBN to a tiny bit and Delta eight,
[SPEAKER_13]: but that's really, it's an artifact of
analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, there is no Delta eight synthase in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, and that, and this was,
I think really, really fascinating too,
[SPEAKER_11]: cause you know, you see certain terpenes
track with other terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: whereas they might not.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, and that's what's really cool is
like by, you know, kind of filling in the
[SPEAKER_11]: rainbow and where, you know, cause what
we've, you know, through the kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: little, the, the terpene kind of analysis
that we, you know, we created with this
[SPEAKER_11]: algorithm, you know, with, with like,
you know, 98, 99% predictability,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it puts, you know, pretty much
any strain that we test in California,
[SPEAKER_11]: into one of about four primary smell
groups.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then within each primary smell group,
there's two to three sub groups.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, so there's, so what we've seen is
counting primary and secondary is about 14
[SPEAKER_11]: or 14 total smells.
[SPEAKER_13]: I called it arch types.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Arch types.
[SPEAKER_13]: Arch types.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: 20 years ago, depending on primarily,
I was only looking at THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that made it a lot simpler,
but that's what I called them arch types
[SPEAKER_13]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: I found out that with the GC, I could
easily tell what the parents were.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I had the, uh, the original parents,
like a tie and an Afghan, if I had a GC of
[SPEAKER_13]: those, and then I made a high F1 hybrid
between them and I, I, I GC did.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could easily pick it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think about, you know, these analytical
tools and how they provide us these,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, empowered, uh, abilities to kind
of, you know, fill in the gaps,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, cause, uh, you know,
with, with, you know, seeing where the
[SPEAKER_11]: archetypes or arch types kind of are,
you know, and, and, you know, you can kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of, you know, kind of, you know,
I mean, almost without doing genetic
[SPEAKER_11]: mapping, you can do this chemical mapping
to where, yeah, you can kind of like
[SPEAKER_11]: really quickly discern you know,
from a male or female, which, which way
[SPEAKER_11]: it's leaning, you know, from the turf
profile and to be able to also breed
[SPEAKER_11]: unique things and bring out turpentine and
pining in coda and amounts, which you
[SPEAKER_13]: never see the entire world's land races,
terpene profiles before they're polluted.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then just by looking at a hybrid,
you'd probably be able to predict how much
[SPEAKER_13]: of what kind of parents it had in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, and you know, it's, it's
fascinating too, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's this, there's one terpene
awesomene and I love that name awesomene,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, O-C-I-M-E-N-E, but it's like
awesome, you know, and, uh, and so,
[SPEAKER_11]: so like the smell papaya and, and mango
and green crack and dream queen,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, those strains are all in this
very unique kind of myrcine awesomene
[SPEAKER_11]: grouping, you know, which is myrcine
primary awesomene as a secondary.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know anybody who's tried it with
THC?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, well, I mean, all those strains are
THC dominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just awesomene and THC pure.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, but, but, but, you know,
cause, cause there's this one strain in
[SPEAKER_11]: the pines and it's an, it's a,
it's a, it's a 0.01% outlier of any data
[SPEAKER_11]: we've seen in California, but in the pines
is this, you know, beautiful pineapple
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of smelling strain that, that,
you know, uh, you know, has won emerald
[SPEAKER_11]: cup a couple, you know, quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but it's, it's typically this myrcine
awesomene combination, myrcine primary,
[SPEAKER_11]: awesomene second, you know, so myrcine
like substantial, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_11]: awesomene is like, you know, a third the
amount and, uh, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: but, but, you know, from a couple
different groups in the state that
[SPEAKER_11]: sprouted a bunch of in the pine seeds,
um, and then tested a bunch of the phenos,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, what we, what we saw through the
data was that, um, there is a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: different cultivars in there that were
awesomene primary with very little
[SPEAKER_11]: myrcine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's like what's super fascinating
to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause you know, we, you know, that's like,
you know, ultra unique, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: cause, cause, you know, you, you know,
again, you can, with really high
[SPEAKER_11]: predictability, you know, seem to kind of
group anything into one of these 13
[SPEAKER_11]: groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Grab one of those as a clone, because,
uh, it's pretty easy to clean it up and
[SPEAKER_13]: make it to it produces pure awesomene and
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scientifically,
[SPEAKER_10]: what's the name of the 13 types again,
Alec, what's the scientific like
[SPEAKER_10]: disclosure of information for those
particular, uh, terpene types?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're, they're, they're,
they're mono and sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I mean, you know,
most of the, most of the ones that we see
[SPEAKER_11]: that are ever primary are said are mono
terpenes, you know, so like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: super, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terpene super classes and subclasses kind
of, but, but you know, um, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: most of the terpenes that are primary and
are co-dominant are also mono terpenes,
[SPEAKER_11]: which are the ones that are first to go,
you know, that, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: it seems from the point you harvest the
plant, it's just straight gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, like just, just even in
the most perfect, cool, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: controlled drying conditions, you still
lose so much terpenes, which is why the
[SPEAKER_11]: whole live resin thing is so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's like, you know, fresh freezing
a plant straight off, extracting it under
[SPEAKER_11]: the most, you know, cold, cool conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Low temperature, you know, and you,
you, you see the ability to retain and
[SPEAKER_11]: preserve, you know, up to 10, you know,
seven to 10, seven to 12% total terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: concentration, you know, and, you know,
and, and, and then also, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: some of these other, you know,
cause there's a lot of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: mono terpenes, which are the ones that are
first to boil, which are also the ones
[SPEAKER_11]: that are most co-dominant.
[SPEAKER_11]: They, um, you know, they, they,
they, you know, you, you see them
[SPEAKER_11]: substantially go away while, while,
you know, you know, especially in
[SPEAKER_11]: extracts, while other terpenes like the
sesquiterpene like beta carophylene and
[SPEAKER_11]: humaline, they will end up in
concentrating.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and so you see in extracts,
you know, typically so, so high amount of
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrates or beta carophylene dominant
or co-dominant because, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: those terpenes stick around while the
other more volatile, more primary terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: will boil off.
[SPEAKER_13]: What we found is that when you,
if you dry plants for two weeks in the
[SPEAKER_13]: dark, and then you store them boxed for
three months to cure them, that cost 90%
[SPEAKER_13]: plus of the terpenes from when it was
harvested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's, what's so interesting to me is
that we were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the types of terpenes that a particular
plant strain or cultivar can actually
[SPEAKER_10]: naturally produce on its own.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then now I'm starting to think that if
you can actually combine the natural
[SPEAKER_10]: system, which is the biology as well as
the strain, you can actually get such a
[SPEAKER_10]: much higher diversity of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like that's what we're seeing
on our end.
[SPEAKER_13]: The diversity of terpenes is as much
limited by the synthases that are present
[SPEAKER_13]: as, as a fertile rich soil, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you've got to have the synthase
that is required to make that particular
[SPEAKER_13]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have it, then it's like
trying to make a CBD with the plant that
[SPEAKER_13]: only makes THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, but being that there is the synthase
that exists in the genetic, like in the
[SPEAKER_11]: epigenetic, epigenetic of the plant,
I think for sure, I'm definitely convinced
[SPEAKER_11]: that environmental kind of influences such
as UV spectrum, such as perfect plant,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, fertility and microbiome,
like symbiosis, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: it seems absolutely that it, you know,
kind of would in some way drive this
[SPEAKER_11]: biochemical, you know, kind of production
or amounts that might be produced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Amounts changing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the profile is slightly
altering, but I don't see new terpenes or
[SPEAKER_13]: new cannabinoids being produced by unless
the plant has the ability to do so.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're seeing new terpenes come up that the
plant was not producing before with the
[SPEAKER_10]: correct biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll check this out really quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Institute of Ecology in the
Netherlands, they just came out with this
[SPEAKER_10]: article.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check it out on Google.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called The World's Most Spoken
Language is Terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the Netherlands, they know a few things
about growing grass.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: So these guys came out with this article
saying that terpene is the world's most
[SPEAKER_10]: spoken language because it's the
microorganisms communicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a signaling molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like pheromones that are things
that can sense and respond to and then
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these different levels to how
plants are communicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that really first opened my
mind to this was during my grad school
[SPEAKER_01]: training, learning how we interact with
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on human cells, there's things called
toll-like receptors, and they're signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors that recognize unique little
structures in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, LPS, lipopolysaccharide,
is found on the surface of most bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: gram-negative bacteria, and is associated
with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get too much LPS in your system,
in your gut, and it leaks into your
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic circulation because you have a
leaky gut issue or something, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: overactive inflammation, which can be
dangerous for your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similarly, there's receptors such as
these toll-like receptors on plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are interacting and talking to the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that level going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you were saying before,
Peter, about bacteria making their own
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and their own compounds that are
interacting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these terpenes aren't just,
they don't just smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all of these physiological
functions, which is fascinating and just
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to be explored.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I posted that article in the Hash
Church group.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're the world's most spoken language
is terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a bit sorry that when I did these
tests back in 2000, that I did not try
[SPEAKER_13]: them also orally, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: All I did was I tried them in a vaporized
volcano with 25 milligrams of pure THC,
[SPEAKER_13]: different amounts of different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, absolutely the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Terpenes modify and potentially a THC,
the right terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, even orally, since Tony sent me that
Terp sugar and the tear.
[SPEAKER_13]: Many people have told it to me,
but I never did it myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can't comment directly.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm commenting directly right now myself
as someone who has done it, who is saying
[SPEAKER_19]: it absolutely modulates.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it surprised me because it modulates
in an almost psychedelic way, almost the
[SPEAKER_19]: way a small dose of mushroom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's modulating 11 hydroxy instead
of THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't even hear the thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I first took the Terp sugar,
I had no intention in any way,
[SPEAKER_19]: shape or form of doing some experiment
that I was going to see if I was
[SPEAKER_19]: modulating.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hadn't dabbed for probably 15 or 20
minutes and I just tried it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I drank half the glass and I was kind
of like, whoa, I almost feel like like
[SPEAKER_19]: tipsy or like like that energy of like,
oh, I think I.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and that's what's so cool,
too, is like, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it's like pioneering it,
you know, because like for so long in all
[SPEAKER_11]: the recreational and medical markets,
there's been these fucking products that
[SPEAKER_11]: are put out as edibles that are from these
strains that people are calling and
[SPEAKER_11]: suggesting are indica or sativa,
you know, and edible.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's hilarious is like, you know,
it's like the process of making Delta 9
[SPEAKER_11]: THC or decarboxylating into Delta 9 THC is
boiling off all the mono and
[SPEAKER_11]: sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So so so so what is in an indica edible or
sativa edible?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's not terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's almost like suggestive selling and
unsubstantiated like placebo effect
[SPEAKER_11]: pushing kind of, you know, reality
because, you know, I don't think most
[SPEAKER_11]: people have ever experienced like a real
indica or sativa edible high like you just
[SPEAKER_11]: did with the Terp sugar because nobody's
really kind of taking like substantial
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene concentrations of the natural
plant that are then being put with Delta 9
[SPEAKER_11]: and oil ingested, you know, and and so so,
you know, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so much of the variation that
people are are having from eating an
[SPEAKER_11]: edible and being like, No, for sure,
this is this is indica for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is diva.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would imagine it would have to be
specifically more to do with, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, whether you're eating it on a
full stomach or empty stomach,
[SPEAKER_11]: whether you, you know, kind of and what
what the dose I think is one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: biggest things that's, you know,
differentiates if any of the THC has been
[SPEAKER_11]: converted to metabolism and all that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you like possibly leave that with
like a cold pressed like olive oil,
[SPEAKER_12]: for example, over time, do you think to be
able to experience that?
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd have to reintroduce and recombine
like the distilled off terpenes,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, because I mean, any heat is,
you know, going to pretty much,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, get rid of most of the,
you know, kind of mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm talking about like old school
medicine where you like literally take a
[SPEAKER_12]: jar like this and fill it with olive oil
and do like a slow tinctured extraction
[SPEAKER_12]: process.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, I mean, that would for sure
be good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if you didn't heat it,
I mean, I mean, the only thing,
[SPEAKER_11]: though, is it's it would only
decarboxylate and become psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, from like, you know,
over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because decarboxylation is a
process of heat and time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the hotter the heat, the quicker it
happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lower the heat, the longer it takes
to, you know, longer takes to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, you could have a very,
you know, amazing full plant extracted
[SPEAKER_11]: acidic cannabinoid THCA terpene infused
olive oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, to have that THCA be in the
Delta 9 form with the with the natural
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes to then affect the psychoactivity
is another thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally hear you on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what you can also do is you take your
dried cannabis buds, you put it in a
[SPEAKER_13]: pressure cooker covered with ghee,
then you you cook it long enough to
[SPEAKER_13]: activate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that a half an hour an hour?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you open it up and almost all the
terpenes are still in the ghee.
[SPEAKER_13]: They haven't left.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not gone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the terp sugar is unique because
although it can be also combined with
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabinoids, what I have is just terpene.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's no cannabinoids in it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you eat those first and then smoke
later, does the terps help you enjoy your
[SPEAKER_13]: smoke better?
[SPEAKER_19]: Not as much as if I puff first and then
drink some later, like even 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_19]: minutes later.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I said, it surprised me how it made
me feel.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, it didn't make me feel that way for a
super extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_19]: But for sure, for like an hour,
I was like, wow, this is like undeniable.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was Jack Frost, Terp sugar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, so.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just put a little clementine and just
you just pull.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dry rips.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a pipette?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a glass pipette?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a glass pipette.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of my preferred ways to puff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you put the terp, you just put just
dip it in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dip the tip, tip.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dip the tip.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dip the terps.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all you do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you just inhale.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what it does is it has a micro drop
that's in there that oscillates around the
[SPEAKER_15]: oxygen that you pull through.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you really want to feel like it's
kind of like your, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_15]: your mind opener, if you will.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice flavoring, but just like the
sugars in the water you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you just inhale the terpenes,
it's another experience on its own.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it goes really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night, basically, I couldn't move off
the counts at this party.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the date pen in one hand and the
terp tip like straw in the other.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just like, I hit the terps by
themselves and I'm like, that's wicked.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I would hit this pen and I'd be
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tony.
[SPEAKER_13]: Calypsey.
[SPEAKER_13]: What works better, Tony, if you hit the
terps first and then the cannabinoid THC,
[SPEAKER_13]: for example, or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I like hitting the terps first and
then the THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tony, Tony.
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'd love to get you guys' thought on
like, so, you know, either of you put that
[SPEAKER_11]: paper out beyond cannabis about,
you know, these other cannabinometic
[SPEAKER_11]: producing plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Echinacea, ashwagandha, you know,
kind of kava, all these other plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: But also what's really fascinating in that
paper, it spells about copal, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: having this certain terpene in it that is
a partial CB1 receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_11]: And copal is this, you know, amazing
sacred smudge used ceremonially throughout
[SPEAKER_11]: all these traditions across the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's just so fascinating to me that
there's this terpene that has a similar
[SPEAKER_11]: effect to the CB1 receptor binding
affinity that THC does as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what happens when you take that terpene
and you isolate it and recombine it with
[SPEAKER_11]: THC?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like a new high that nobody's ever
felt?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that like a modulated effect from
this terpene that's going to be like
[SPEAKER_11]: really cool?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe copal, even though it binds to
it, don't bind diddly squat and all it'll
[SPEAKER_13]: do is bring you down off your great THC
high.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam is the proponent of THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like a THC warrior.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time I ever met Sam,
he was like, he was yelling fuck CBD in a
[SPEAKER_11]: restaurant when Chimera introduced me to
him.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I said something about when I first
met him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy for the patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely, I'm happy for the patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: But me for recreational use, it has no
value for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what you said to me when I
first met you.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was like, oh yeah, doing this and
that with CBD.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you said exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do think that you could utilize CBD
in different portions to your THC and be
[SPEAKER_15]: able to get different overall recreational
in your words.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Afghan hash is primarily about
equal THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well Sam, but what happens when you take
that epic Afghan hash that's equal CBD and
[SPEAKER_11]: THC and then also add this copal terpene
that's another CB1 receptor agonist?
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be more recreationally
interesting to you, sir?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little bit cautious about smoking
things that there's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: hundreds of years of history.
[SPEAKER_13]: Copal, I guess it's probably safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're inhaling the shit out of
copal whenever it's like burned in
[SPEAKER_11]: ceremony, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's all up in your grill,
you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've even got some copal hair,
you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: But I like my resin better than copal so
far.
[SPEAKER_13]: True that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I feel like I'm puffing alone,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see enough smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably is copal.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been puffing for all the slackers on
the panel.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw some people not smoking,
so I took it upon me to smoke their
[SPEAKER_15]: portion while we were smoking during the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been hitting it hard today.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my one day.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how it started.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was our ritual.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, well, this is the day to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We could actually puff.
[SPEAKER_11]: What an epic ritual.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_19]: It definitely started with a lot of
smoking.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's reminiscent of me.
[SPEAKER_19]: The whole energy that is Hash Church is
reminiscent of going to the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_19]: conference and watching like Ralph Metzner
and Jonathan Ott and all of these
[SPEAKER_19]: different guys get up there and be like,
I went to Harvard.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to Yale.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to thank my doctorate degree.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you'd get like John Postamitz
would get up there.
[SPEAKER_19]: He'd be like, hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't really go to university.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything I learned, I learned from the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that was the sort of Hash Church
mentality of like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: There's been a lot learned from my
perspective, from this plant, directly
[SPEAKER_19]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I didn't, I wasn't able to go to a
school.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: If there was a class available,
I would have taken it for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: There wasn't, but we all learned anyway.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's kind of what Hash Church is
about, getting all the different
[SPEAKER_19]: perspectives from the people who have
chosen to be, to get degrees and to search
[SPEAKER_19]: things, the people like yourself,
scientists, people who are doing testing,
[SPEAKER_19]: people like Sam, who are all of us coming
together and having a couple of bowls and
[SPEAKER_19]: opening up a discussion.
[SPEAKER_19]: THC is a THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: 150 episodes says it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can't learn this shit in school.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish we could.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, in a sense, I learned a little bit
about it in school.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like mostly I learned the economics of
selling weed in school.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all changing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Schools, universities will be teaching
this and contract growers will be growing
[SPEAKER_13]: it just like every other major
agricultural crop in America.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cramdella Cram will be able to do it
because no other crop has ever been as
[SPEAKER_11]: regulated like this and such high stakes
in this gold rush.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, all the miners have such
substantial backing behind them.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's organic vegetable growers now that
break their butt and earn a small fraction
[SPEAKER_13]: of what they could be earning with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of those same farmers though,
won't be able to pass, even though they're
[SPEAKER_11]: organic certified, they won't be able to
pass a cannabis regulated test.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if like the PPB, you know,
disqualification limit is like 10 part per
[SPEAKER_11]: billion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause in the national organic program,
you know, there's this concept of UREC,
[SPEAKER_11]: U R E C unavoidable residual environmental
contamination, which accounts for the fact
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're in the toxic environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like for an organic farmer that is
growing this amazing organic crop,
[SPEAKER_11]: they can have up to 5% of the EPA allowed
limit of a pesticide that's approved for
[SPEAKER_11]: that crop on it and still pass as organic
into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for a lot of these pesticides like
imidacloprid, spheromethicin, Michael
[SPEAKER_11]: butanol, et cetera, you know, like the
UREC allowed national organic program
[SPEAKER_11]: limit is like 50, 60 part per billion.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's like if 10 part per billion is
the limit, you know, it's gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_11]: the most sophisticated organic farmer in,
you know, that there is, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I think it's gonna breed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think regulations is gonna breed out
this like amazing farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: They find organic farms that are really
far away from where the spray is,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's really hard and really difficult
to find a situation like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think sadly it's going to spawn massive
innovation for refinement processes where
[SPEAKER_15]: they will start to be able to figure out
how to pull out pesticides.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I don't like that, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a bummer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, cause I think, I think the
biggest fucking, the biggest customers of
[SPEAKER_11]: that service are going to be the fucking
green revolutionist bucks that are,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, trying to monocrop spray with
systemics and then remediate post fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: process.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that I think is like a cop out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I think, I think regulations,
I think the, I think that the failure of
[SPEAKER_11]: that technology to be scalable hopefully
is the saving grace for the small medium
[SPEAKER_11]: scale farms that, you know, kind of are
leading the slow food movement in
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I hear when I hear you say
that Alec, I hear Bill Hicks saying,
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's a good market.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: The, the, the systemic plant-based
chemical clean up after through the
[SPEAKER_19]: distillate market.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good market.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm just saying that the massive
market.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're Monsanto fucking leaning,
I just see that it'll spawn that what it
[SPEAKER_15]: is is because look at the market,
the way it is now, everybody has their own
[SPEAKER_15]: way of doing business and not everyone may
necessarily agree with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it goes on and I think it's going to
spawn people doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you, if you look at corn or
soybeans or sugar cane or any of the major
[SPEAKER_13]: agricultural crops in America,
sugar beets, they're all 70, 80,
[SPEAKER_13]: 90% GMO and sprayed with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think cannabis is like gonna,
you know, in some spiritual level,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's going to almost like shrug off the
imposters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I, I, I deeply feel that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that it's going to
support the pharmaceuticalization.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel that most cannabis users will,
will ride their skateboard down to the
[SPEAKER_13]: seven 11, buy some cannabis, some ice
cream and some chips and the chips will be
[SPEAKER_13]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ice cream will be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the cannabis will be, I don't hope
it's GMO, but I wouldn't be particularly
[SPEAKER_13]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_13]: American consumers, they care about cheap
prices and taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is almost going to raise up this
consciousness of I don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: What else am I putting in my body that's
talking toxic?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me eat an autoimmune paleo diet.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's happening now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if the plants are actually
helping assist in that process and just
[SPEAKER_12]: guiding us back to what we know already.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of the plants grown on and tested had
pesticides and insecticides or fungicides
[SPEAKER_13]: on them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, interesting to me when I read
that article about the, uh, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a hydrocarbon that's lighter than
air and it floats through the air into our
[SPEAKER_10]: bodies and it assimilates with what?
[SPEAKER_10]: With our biology, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the biology.
[SPEAKER_11]: It hijacks us.
[SPEAKER_11]: It like, it like lures us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So think about that interconnectedness
that Selena is talking about with our
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so we're physically right
communicating.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these plants are, producing these
terpenes to communicate with us for what
[SPEAKER_10]: we need talking to us, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's their, that's one of their ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our body creates the same smells that re
that, that bring people in or repel people
[SPEAKER_10]: away from us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we're cultivating these plants,
we're sharing such a, such an intimate
[SPEAKER_10]: connection and communication, not only
from a biological, but a real physical
[SPEAKER_10]: connection that we're having different
groups of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people love smell of a particular
plant, other people hate the smell of a
[SPEAKER_13]: particular plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really individualistic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and real quick, I wanted to,
I wanted to read this, uh, this little
[SPEAKER_11]: story about this, uh, I mean, it's super,
she's super.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so that's, that, that's so interesting
about that interconnection.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate the space to kind of
disclose this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, but so you've got that biological,
uh, integration right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so think about the energetic,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if any of you guys have ever,
uh, heard about Carilion photography.
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anybody ever seen that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have quite a few photographs of,
uh, raw plants and stuff that have been
[SPEAKER_19]: Carilion photographed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you share those please?
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to see those.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, so would I.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, well, sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll open up my 150,000 photo light room
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I know what they are.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're at my house, Marcus,
could you please find mine?
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got five or 10 of them scattered with
my two billion photographs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, you were saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so the, uh, so the Carilion
photography, it's, uh, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: showing like an energetic life force,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That can kind of come off of all objects,
whether it be a stone or whether it be a
[SPEAKER_10]: human, it comes off at different
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have what some, some people may
call, you know, an aura, but it's,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's really an energetic field and plants,
just like I talked about with the 8th day,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's, it's a meeting this ultraviolet
frequency, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's another reason why some
people, you know, uh, and this is what we
[SPEAKER_10]: believe that kind roots, uh, is that,
uh, people share such a beautiful
[SPEAKER_10]: interconnectedness with their plants,
you know, like some people will name their
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's actually transpiring,
what's communicating is that energetic
[SPEAKER_10]: frequency that we're, we're, we're,
we're, we're obtaining not only through
[SPEAKER_10]: our own energetic field, but also through
the biology, through the physics that that
[SPEAKER_10]: plant is connecting with us on a physical
realm, as well as an energetic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's what was so cool about
what Alex said about tuning into like the
[SPEAKER_10]: secret life of plants, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so we got this, uh, uh, much deeper
connection on some of the things that you
[SPEAKER_10]: guys were talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I'd just bring that.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may real quick, sorry, I dropped off
when I was reading that, but, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: so the, so this, uh, the Kaimari,
so Kaimari is the dear spirit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the dear spirit Kaimari is considered
to be the guide between this world and the
[SPEAKER_11]: sky worlds or spirit realms.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kaimari guided the gods and goddesses to
earth, but when they arrived, they had all
[SPEAKER_11]: forgotten who they were.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is believed that the peyote buttons
hidden in the desert are Kaimari's tracks
[SPEAKER_11]: left behind to guide us to the spirit
realm and help us remember who we are and
[SPEAKER_11]: where we come from.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, yeah, like with terpenes
and the way that they lure us and kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: this plant and how it empowers us and
awakens and shifts our desire to eat
[SPEAKER_11]: cleaner and take care of our bodies and
almost become an evangelist of its word.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think they're all,
all these wisdom plants are kind of doing
[SPEAKER_11]: that, you know, in such an interesting
way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's wonderful because cannabis is
such a catalyst, you know, all of a
[SPEAKER_16]: sudden, so many people are paying
attention to the plant world because they
[SPEAKER_16]: love, you know, weed so much.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the weed is just luring people in to
realize that, wow, all plants have
[SPEAKER_16]: incredible spirits.
[SPEAKER_16]: All plants is a gateway drug for us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is such a wonderful ambassador
right now, especially in this time,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, with all of the persecution that
it has endured to get us forward to this
[SPEAKER_16]: place and all of the people, you know,
like, I think back on so many people who
[SPEAKER_16]: have been part of the black market before
we were able to have these discussions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Out in the open, you know, we're more
willing to continue working with the
[SPEAKER_16]: plant, even though they knew that it was a
possibility that their children could be
[SPEAKER_16]: taken away.
[SPEAKER_16]: They still felt an incredible call to this
plant, knowing that it's such a medicinal
[SPEAKER_16]: value to all of us on the planet,
that it was worth fighting for the plants
[SPEAKER_20]: growing us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I like to think about it as like a
mutually beneficial relationship,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, so a lot of people are,
you know, they use the term I use,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's really about the way that I see
it anyways, especially when I pair it with
[SPEAKER_12]: my own spiritual practices when working
with this medicine, is I actually invite
[SPEAKER_12]: it to have an experience through me as I'm
having an experience through her.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're actually having this shared
experience where we're growing and we're
[SPEAKER_12]: evolving and we're learning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know, I know it sounds kind of
like weird, but it reminds me of that M.
[SPEAKER_12]: Night Shyamalan movie where the plant
plants they were putting out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were affecting people's
biochemistry, their cognition and kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: we've watched that again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So imagine we're having this, this
relationship and we're, we're re-engaging
[SPEAKER_12]: in this conversation with this beautiful
sacred spirit plant medicine teacher.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is re-awakening the divine feminine
in the world and within each of us and
[SPEAKER_11]: hoping to fucking rebalance out the
duality and the suppression that has,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the repression so deeply that has
existed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I imagine that like this plant,
like on like a, on a conscious level
[SPEAKER_12]: really like opens up the mind,
like really, so you can start to explore
[SPEAKER_12]: these concepts in ways that aren't so
limiting.
[SPEAKER_12]: They, they allow us to challenge our
belief systems in a safe space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found that, you know, energetically
because she is, I mean, she's wise,
[SPEAKER_12]: she's gentle, but she's also fierce.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when we respect her and when we,
when we participate with her in this
[SPEAKER_12]: journey, there's so much healing and
learning and growth and self actualization
[SPEAKER_12]: that can, that can happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, that's happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I imagine that even, you know,
the most unconscious people, the people
[SPEAKER_12]: that are trying to profiteer off of this
plant, she's also working her magic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've also found that the people that
continue to exploit her, they do,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, I believe that, you know,
intentions reveal themselves.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why it's the funnest thing in
the world to combine the garden magic with
[SPEAKER_20]: the plant magic medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like, look at how many people are
beginning to garden again, just because
[SPEAKER_12]: they're discovering growing cannabis
first, you know, it shows you how to feed
[SPEAKER_12]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it empowers you so much because it
shows you when you're doing well,
[SPEAKER_11]: it shows itself to be so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really, yeah, like lights off your
like green thumb, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it really is kind of in a bit of a
way, like the gateway medicine to like
[SPEAKER_11]: spiritual kind of internalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it brings you back to the other
plants, you know, and like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: what else?
[SPEAKER_11]: What other plants?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh shit, you know, boom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wachuma, Ayahuasca, and so amazing how,
you know, so many of these plants are
[SPEAKER_11]: these, you know, female spirit medicine
teachers, you know, and there's also
[SPEAKER_12]: masculine, you know, medicine teachers as
well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: San Pedro, Arboga.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to ask you guys, have you guys
heard of the spirit plant medicine
[SPEAKER_12]: conference that happens at UBC every year?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have speakers that come from all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's indigenous leaders.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are workshops, amazing
conversations, a really small,
[SPEAKER_12]: intimate group of beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris Killam is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I met Martin Lee there last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a really beautiful community,
but really the whole point of it is to
[SPEAKER_12]: have these discussions around how we can
continue to empower the re-emergence of
[SPEAKER_12]: these plants and how we can have these
experiences with them and utilize them to
[SPEAKER_12]: our best benefit as we're evolving as a
conscious humanity.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maintaining the integrity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because as soon as we go into exploitation
and that's that kind of comes full circle
[SPEAKER_12]: around where my question was with the bat
guano, you know, how is it affecting the
[SPEAKER_12]: communities locally?
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have people that are going off to
have ayahuasca journeys with shamans that
[SPEAKER_12]: have a certificate on the wall where they
put in 200 hours or something and are now
[SPEAKER_12]: guiding people on a journey, I don't think
that's... I hate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think it's... Going to the
bartending school and having a
[SPEAKER_11]: certificate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and like to me and my experience and
personally, I've not done ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not had an experience with her yet
because I want to meet the right person
[SPEAKER_12]: and the right community in order to have
that journey.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not just like, oh great,
I'm on a list and now I'm going to
[SPEAKER_12]: drinking some tea and drinking some brew.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really about the experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for me, I'm looking as an experience
to grow and evolve.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that there's an integration
portion around that and it's not just a
[SPEAKER_12]: one-time deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: So really looking at these spirit plants
with respect and honor and reverence and
[SPEAKER_12]: humbleness, I think really, it really
allows us to go deeper on that journey and
[SPEAKER_12]: to be the receivers, the students of their
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, this is a beautiful piece of
banisteriopsis cappii.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry, be cappii.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask, do any of you meditate with
your plants?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's like totally off the wall,
but does anyone ever just take the time to
[SPEAKER_12]: sit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, tell me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm not used to having such a
beautiful community of people that are so
[SPEAKER_12]: open all the time.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's been around for hundreds of
years really, and we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_20]: keep that stream of flow of consciousness
happening.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been the weirdo.
[SPEAKER_12]: I pray with my plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hold their little hands.
[SPEAKER_12]: I talk to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a ceremony and a whole thing
around.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are not weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't think I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're weird.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam's holding his plants right until they
go into the chipper to be prepared for dry
[SPEAKER_19]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to hear about your meditation
experience though.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are nodding.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please share.
[SPEAKER_11]: My what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm about to do a plant meditation right
now with this beautiful Brazilian medicine
[SPEAKER_11]: called hape.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a plant preparation from Brazil
that's of many different types of plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: certain ashes of plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to a Brazilian apothecary in the
Amazon, they'll have 20, 30 different
[SPEAKER_11]: types of hape, different plants,
different combinations of plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: different ashes, different amounts of
ashes.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the main plants in it is sacred
tobacco, tobacco rustica or other type of
[SPEAKER_11]: ceremonial tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very commonly used as a medicine
adjunct during ayahuasca ceremony.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody has this dose range threshold
where anything after the dose threshold
[SPEAKER_11]: tolerance is a really deep spiritual purge
where you're just laying face ground in
[SPEAKER_11]: the dirt and just putting your hands in
the dirt and just throwing up deep into
[SPEAKER_11]: the ground and just praying and thanking
the world and thanking the earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anything before that, which is the
more meditative use of it, you set your
[SPEAKER_11]: prayers and intentions and you give thanks
to the plants and the medicines.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so important to give thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You take this and you take it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's this really beautiful medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is Yanomamo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost lighter because it has a lot
more ash in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a lot more ash in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically put it in this tool called a
Kiripe.
[SPEAKER_11]: You snap that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you go.
[SPEAKER_19]: You blow it in.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a pina.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pina?
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was called a pina.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Yanomamo people used to blow up their
noses through those long tubes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be called that in Yanomamo.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the self applicator, which is the
Kiripe, and then there's the one that you
[SPEAKER_11]: blow into somebody else's nose,
which is the Tepe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Traditionally, indigenously, for thousands
of years, this medicine, as well as Yopo,
[SPEAKER_11]: has been used in this fashion to basically
launch into your nasal cavity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you let it sit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It opens up all these receptors in your
scalp.
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes you cry, like your tear ducts
open.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazingly cleansing and clearing of
your nasal cavity, any type of nasal
[SPEAKER_11]: decongestion.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just smashes through any type of
seasonal sinus allergy stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you're hungover, it's a really,
really beautiful plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever you do it in small amounts,
it completely focuses you in and returns
[SPEAKER_11]: you to your energetic body.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope to share this with you all
individually next time I see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the meditations ... Thank you for
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was such a beautiful flow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the meditations that I've been
doing lately is really important to my
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I'm coming from a place of
compassion, from a place of nurturing,
[SPEAKER_10]: and really wanting to take care of them,
is when I mix the biology.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I usually do is I create a vortex of
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: As I'm mixing our biology into water,
I mix it into a vortex, kind of like
[SPEAKER_10]: biodynamically, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really potentizing it, but I'm
creating that facilitation of energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I do somewhat of a meditation.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really try and channel within my own
energetic field to kind of just attach or
[SPEAKER_10]: be an open sky of awareness to the shadows
that are in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really focus on gratitude and offering
energies and abundance.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really try and channel gratitude and
more of an offering.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be giving this amendment to
my plants and offering it to them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I come from an energetic place of offering
these amendments, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be fertilizer or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, that just seems to put such a good
level of connection to my plants,
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as just the idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I even do that before I eat them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I take in my plants, I kind of put
some gratitude and offering some
[SPEAKER_10]: compassion energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to just be the right thing to do
with my plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: That passes on the energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: It passes on the medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that that sort of comes full
circle to what we were talking about
[SPEAKER_16]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our consciousness as growers.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you get medicine from somebody that's
a little bit shady with their medicine,
[SPEAKER_16]: then you feel that.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can feel that energy.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can feel that medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that that's an important part of
if we're going to be giving this cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: plant a voice, then it should be a voice
of the power and the potency of this
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine to help awaken us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Intentional horticulture.
[SPEAKER_16]: Intentional and of health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of the growers out there are the
shamans of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are the ones who have a voice for this
plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it should be taken lightly.
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like if your flowers are going to
affect somebody's day, if they're going to
[SPEAKER_16]: affect somebody's lifetime in any way,
then that intention needs to be put out
[SPEAKER_16]: into those flowers so that you know that
you're going to be healing people and
[SPEAKER_16]: you're going to be giving people a wealth
of good feelings rather than of any
[SPEAKER_16]: negativity.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of energy or of the environment on and on.
[SPEAKER_11]: A proper initiation into this work with
this medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the work I do at SC Labs is
around education and helping to empower
[SPEAKER_11]: blood tenders that are serving this
medicine to people, especially the
[SPEAKER_11]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the deepest importances that I
think that there is that people so
[SPEAKER_11]: disrespect and take lightly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a sacred thing that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a veteran of the Navy and I do a lot
of work with vets and post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_11]: stress.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the deepest things that is
close to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so gnarly is for vets with
post-traumatic stress or anybody with
[SPEAKER_11]: post-traumatic stress or any type of high
anxiety prone or mental conditions,
[SPEAKER_11]: psychiatric conditions that have not used
cannabis before, if they smoke a 29% THC-A
[SPEAKER_11]: strain with high turpentine in it like
Jack or train rack or sage or something
[SPEAKER_11]: like that, that could very much set them
away from ever using cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so trippy, this guy Morpheus,
I don't know if you guys remember that
[SPEAKER_11]: name, Morpheus, he's this dude,
Michael Baucus.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's one of Mark Lewis's partners who work
with Phytex and do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Baucus put it best I ever heard it
described because it described my personal
[SPEAKER_11]: experience when I first got out of the
Navy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had used cannabis before, but when I got
out of the Navy and got my discharge
[SPEAKER_11]: papers, my buddy pulled out a bowl and
loaded it up and I took a huge hit off of
[SPEAKER_11]: it and I coughed my brains out and my eyes
got bloodshot and veins just digging out
[SPEAKER_11]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got so awkwardly and uncomfortably high
that the next 20 years plus times that I
[SPEAKER_11]: smoked, I almost never did it again
because each time it just got worse and
[SPEAKER_11]: worse and I had to go hide it in my bed
and sleep it off.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, man, maybe cannabis isn't for
me anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: I shared it and had such empathy and
compassion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through this process, I've developed such
empathy and compassion for everybody that
[SPEAKER_11]: hasn't yet discovered their relationship
with this plant because so many people,
[SPEAKER_11]: so many really amazing people close to us
and our families, they're like,
[SPEAKER_11]: oh, I don't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: The weed these days is so strong,
but it's actually because there's this
[SPEAKER_11]: thing called cannabis post-traumatic
stress.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens to people that are first time
users, especially anxiety prone
[SPEAKER_11]: post-traumatic stress type people,
but then it also happens to people that
[SPEAKER_11]: take a break in between use and start back
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it also happens sometimes to a subset
of people where they're just steady users
[SPEAKER_11]: of cannabis and one day it shifts.
[SPEAKER_11]: What it is is you get this overstimulation
of your CB1 receptor from high THC that
[SPEAKER_11]: creates this neural snapshot of this
experience that tends to create this
[SPEAKER_11]: neuroplastic memory of cannabis being
associatively negative or anxiety
[SPEAKER_11]: creating.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then each time you do it, it goes deeper
and deeper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you take small amounts,
it can reinforce this neuroplastic memory
[SPEAKER_11]: of cannabis creating anxiety and being
bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever I speak with bud tenders,
because you go to these advanced high
[SPEAKER_11]: times and everything else where it's just
like free dabs, free dabs, free dabs,
[SPEAKER_11]: and everybody's just blasting people that
have never even smoked cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not funny either.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like dosing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like puddling somebody with a handful
of acid.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost sociomaniacal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try to imprint the sacred importance of
helping to frame the experience properly
[SPEAKER_11]: by using high CBD, low THC where you're
microdosing THC and you're going through
[SPEAKER_11]: the ritual of grinding up bud and rolling
it up and putting your prayer into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you take the smoke and you go and do
things that are associatively pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is you dose low and titrate slow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Over time, as you're coming in communion
with the plant, you can slowly titrate up
[SPEAKER_11]: your THC to where you can help to
essentially provide the most harm
[SPEAKER_11]: reductive strategy for somebody,
especially anxiety prone people like Bets.
[SPEAKER_11]: and everybody else into this relationship
where after they become acclimated to the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant and can handle and withstand the
psychoactive and conscious expanding
[SPEAKER_11]: feelings and let go of the control and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Over time, when you build the THC dose,
THC then always trends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking in terms of like Bets with
post-traumatic stress, it tends to become
[SPEAKER_11]: the primary healing component to the
trauma in the long-term basis.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see that a lot with old Vietnam war
vets and Korean war vets and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: THC is what is their trauma healing daily
med.
[SPEAKER_11]: For a lot of the Iraq and Afghanistan war
vets that are new to cannabis and just
[SPEAKER_11]: getting out, CBD is the ultimate thing to
get them to become acclimated to this
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do feel like this is a rite of
passage, this initiation into the work of
[SPEAKER_11]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a sacred thing that we have to
empower people to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: The last part of the whole thing I'm
saying is when I do these trainings,
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to really mind-fuck people about how
important this is.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have this person who could be one
of the 22 vets a day that kill himself
[SPEAKER_11]: from your post-traumatic stress or one of
the 22 to 25 vets that die a day from
[SPEAKER_11]: prescription pill overdoses, it's like for
that person to one day have an insight
[SPEAKER_11]: that maybe he'll try cannabis and then him
to go to dispensary and stand in front of
[SPEAKER_11]: this 18-year-old kid who's like,
take this your Jack Herrera THC strain,
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like if you set that person off of
the path from its cannabis and reinforce
[SPEAKER_11]: this negative thing because of the way you
served it improperly, that's on your
[SPEAKER_11]: karma, dude, because that person might go
off.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might have been destined that that
person was to be empowered by cannabis to
[SPEAKER_11]: heal their self and to find healing and to
clean their karma, but you, because you're
[SPEAKER_11]: fucking negligent serving of this plant
medicine, ignorance, you might have set
[SPEAKER_11]: that person from ever doing it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you serve it with your dirty hand
after you did the money thing,
[SPEAKER_12]: putting your hand in the jar and then
weighing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's such disrespect.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, consider where that person's
coming from.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going to be best for them?
[SPEAKER_12]: Ask them what kind of effect they're
looking for instead of perpetuating that
[SPEAKER_12]: onto them and bringing it back full
circle.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you empower the nose,
you know, and it goes back to what Sam was
[SPEAKER_11]: saying with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like we're all so different in what
smell resonates with us and what doesn't,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, because, you know, it's not
about you suggestively selling or pushing
[SPEAKER_11]: some placebo effect on somebody and them
never being able to find just what works,
[SPEAKER_11]: but more to empower people's experience
and their nose is the nose nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on here, hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is one of the reasons why I
take real issue with the term all uses,
[SPEAKER_05]: the additional use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's absolutely ways to harm if we're
not treating it responsibly, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of this talk that you're talking
about is about looking for an effect and
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're training bud tenders or we're
working with people, we have to realize if
[SPEAKER_05]: we're dealing with neurological regulatory
issues, PTSD, epilepsy, migraine,
[SPEAKER_05]: other types of issues, a lot of times how
we deal with those endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiencies has nothing to do with having
or maintaining an effect that you would
[SPEAKER_05]: feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about supplementing different
cannabinoids in the body to modulate the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid systems inability to
regulate these neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you can regulate homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on now, hold on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's rarely done with, with smoking
period, because what you're doing when you
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke is you're shotgunning large amounts
of cannabinoids into the body and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: very difficult to regulate dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we're trying to correct
neurotransmitter regulatory issues and
[SPEAKER_05]: PTSD falls into some of those categories
and the ability to, to help correct some
[SPEAKER_05]: of that damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about sustaining levels in
the body of certain cannabinoids that the
[SPEAKER_05]: body can then supplement for a lack of
endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really important when we're
talking about what we're given advice and
[SPEAKER_05]: what we're trying to treat that we are
able to differentiate those two,
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's a lot of people who go in
for help with disorders that a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: times we've learned enough now that even
suggesting smoking is the application to
[SPEAKER_05]: treat them isn't always the best approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of people who have used
smoking approaches to have success with
[SPEAKER_05]: some serious medical conditions,
but we've learned more in the last 10
[SPEAKER_05]: years than we've learned in the last 75.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those things that we've
learned is that although that can work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you enjoy smoking cannabis for its
effects on the body, it might still be
[SPEAKER_05]: better to differentiate the treatment of
the condition you're working with,
[SPEAKER_05]: with the enjoyment of smoking and bringing
in cannabis so that we feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, because if we start
to treat with systematic doses for the
[SPEAKER_05]: PTSD or the seizure disorder or the
fibromyalgia, so that we're keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: sustained levels of certain cannabinoids
that are appropriate for correcting the
[SPEAKER_05]: problems of the presynaptic nervous
system, you can still smoke after work and
[SPEAKER_05]: have that be two separate things,
but have much better efficacy with,
[SPEAKER_05]: with treating those conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of what's being said here is
good information, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's even more in depth than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of blood tenders unintentionally
do recommend at times some things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: misleading or I wouldn't say dangerous
because cannabis itself is such a benign
[SPEAKER_05]: safe thing to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: The worst case scenario is you have a bad
experience, but where it can be dangerous
[SPEAKER_05]: is if we don't understand some of the
science of how cannabis medicine works,
[SPEAKER_05]: then people with critical illness come in,
they try what we have or what the blood
[SPEAKER_05]: tenders have to offer, and they assume
that that's, when it doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_05]: they assume that was all that could have
worked for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It shouldn't have to be that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and, and I've seen it a lot and,
you know, unfortunately in the industry
[SPEAKER_12]: where just misinformation or you're not
informed or you recommend one type of
[SPEAKER_12]: medicine, but haven't done the extensive
research behind that recommendation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that person thinks, well, I took the
Phoenix tears and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's that where it could be
something so much more robust or the
[SPEAKER_12]: application could be wrong for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's such a misnomer that if you're
smoking weed, you're going to cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, and if I may jump in there
too, you know, to, you know, rebuting this
[SPEAKER_11]: in a tiny bit of a way, you know,
I mean, I think from like a harm reduction
[SPEAKER_11]: strategy for most patients, smoking or
vaporizing is probably the most ideal
[SPEAKER_11]: route to become acclimated to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, also, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just kind of become, you know,
100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just mean, I just mean, you know,
for people be coming to terms with the
[SPEAKER_11]: psychoactive effects, because the thing is
the problem, the biggest problem,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I would say one of the biggest
problems right now that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: setting patients off or getting people not
to keep using cannabis or using in the
[SPEAKER_11]: right way is because of the inconsistency
in dosage and the harm and danger,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, almost from a public safety
standpoint of eating edibles, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: like most, most emergency visits regarding
cannabis happened because of ingested,
[SPEAKER_11]: infused cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and whenever, because, because,
you know, this such a wide ranging kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: effect that we experienced, because like,
you know, for one, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're all so different.
[SPEAKER_11]: How is your metabolism fast or slow?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have an active or sedentary
lifestyle?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you eating it on a full or empty
stomach?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's because these things are
going to substantially contribute to
[SPEAKER_11]: whether or not your body processes,
11 hydroxy up to five times the
[SPEAKER_11]: psychoactivity of THC or like one to one
or less.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some people don't even really
get effects from edibles in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's these are all these
different physiological kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: interactions with the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, and so, and just saying that,
and because I mean, yeah, in the future,
[SPEAKER_11]: when there's a reliable, consistent,
you know, standardized, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: microdose thing that patients can,
you know, look to, to slowly, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: to dose low and titrate slow, you know,
they can kind of get towards the
[SPEAKER_11]: experience that they're looking for the
relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is in the basis of THC and its effects on
getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's a very small fraction
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm saying the psychoactive effects,
which is the biggest thing that sets most
[SPEAKER_11]: people off from developing any type of
relationship with cannabis, even for the
[SPEAKER_11]: non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a huge thing in the sense that people
are like, well, you know, I was going to
[SPEAKER_19]: do that, but I was scared.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to get high.
[SPEAKER_19]: So now I'm just getting surgery.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, yeah, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, so therefore THC a isn't used or
CBDA or CBG or CBGA, which all turn out to
[SPEAKER_11]: be the most anti-inflammatory Cox one Cox
two inhibiting compounds in cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: terrified of getting high smoking is not
always, it's not, I don't think it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just don't think it's the best
way to go about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I finish what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so when you smoke, you get these large
doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hear what you're saying from
your particular angle, but I want to just
[SPEAKER_05]: broaden it out to the bigger picture of
cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you smoke, you're getting large doses
of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're saying is that you're going
to acclimate to THC more quickly that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're probably right, but acclimating
the THC is a small, one small angle of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of times when you're acclimating
the THC, what you're doing is building
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're trying to deal with
conditions that are endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiency based tolerance can be your
enemy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to start down-regulating
CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to start having the body
thinking it's over producing an andamide
[SPEAKER_05]: or two AG.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you, what endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome can you mention that
[SPEAKER_11]: down-regulation negatively affects?
[SPEAKER_05]: What, epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if your goal is to have the CB1
receptors function in a way that properly
[SPEAKER_05]: titrates and regulates neurotransmitter
function, when the body starts shutting
[SPEAKER_05]: down the CB1 receptors, it can impact
treatment negatively.
[SPEAKER_11]: From a pure scientific standpoint,
I understand that, but from an application
[SPEAKER_11]: standpoint, I mean, I've been serving on
the board of directors of WAM,
[SPEAKER_11]: the Women's and Men's Alliance for Medical
Marijuana, which has been serving the poor
[SPEAKER_11]: and the terminally ill in the last 25,
30 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, and the experience and work that
Valerie and Mike Corral have done and the
[SPEAKER_11]: anecdotal kind of recipient of information
and awareness that they've gained is,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, THC is by far one of the
most important ones to bring into a
[SPEAKER_11]: well-balanced cannabinoid blend kind of
therapy for most conditions and most
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid deficiency conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, you know, it's like,
I mean, I fully feel and understand what
[SPEAKER_11]: you're saying, but I mean, I don't think
like in the WAM's experience with the
[SPEAKER_11]: thousands of patients that they've worked
with over the last couple of decades has
[SPEAKER_11]: ever suggested or showed that,
you know, kind of THC is negative in the,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the therapeutic treatment of
cannabis towards these different
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's like, I mean, I mean,
there's obviously conditions that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, WAM and Valerie haven't worked
with cannabis on, but you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, anything that you described,
you know, I mean, I mean, Valerie has
[SPEAKER_11]: epilepsy and THC has been, you know,
so I mean, I know Valerie well,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of things have changed in the last
40 years, you know, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where we have to continue to update our
advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to continue to, you know,
we have two peer reviewed papers coming
[SPEAKER_05]: out about every other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have two peer reviewed scientific
reviewed papers, and some of those are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to support what we've thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those are going to cause us to
maybe have to rethink or adjust what we
[SPEAKER_05]: are advising people to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one of the biggest risks we
have is oversimplifying cannabis and its
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic approaches as it's this or
it's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on what walks through the door,
what they are trying to treat,
[SPEAKER_05]: and what part of our central nervous
system or regulatory system cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: interacts that impacts that issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to very much provide a wide
variety of what would be considered the
[SPEAKER_05]: best approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I'm saying is that when we
oversimplify it to the best or the worst
[SPEAKER_05]: or safe or not safe without applying the
context of the now what we know in the
[SPEAKER_05]: last five years specifically is the
variety of different interactions cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: has, you know, for example, you see the
THC CBD debate online all the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: but no one rarely points out that both
people are typically arguing correctly,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're not differentiating between
cancer and other endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're arguing for advice for
different treatments without qualifying
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly what they're speaking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are times when what you're saying
is absolutely correct, and I agree with
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a lot of times that we are
learning that it is not, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've talked to Valerie about this,
and there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to just add something.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just coming back to the part of the
conversation around integrity and making
[SPEAKER_12]: sure that we are producing the best
medicines, especially when we talk about
[SPEAKER_12]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing that really like grinds my gears
is when I see people cutting corners,
[SPEAKER_12]: just growing purely for profit,
not thinking about the end run of the
[SPEAKER_12]: person who's actually receiving the
medicine and how that could potentially
[SPEAKER_12]: affect that person's recovery or their
experience in the first place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had experiences where before I
worked, I shouldn't say worked,
[SPEAKER_12]: before I created the dispenser that I
created, I worked in other places where
[SPEAKER_12]: we've had dirty medicine, Phoenix tears
being created from really subpar
[SPEAKER_12]: materials, thinking that you can just use
a solvent to get rid of the systemic
[SPEAKER_12]: issues like mold or spider mites and
thinking that that's acceptable to then
[SPEAKER_12]: give to someone who is desperate looking
for a solution to heal their cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And oftentimes the medical patients that
we deal with are people that are in those
[SPEAKER_12]: desperate places.
[SPEAKER_12]: So having that also be present when you're
thinking about working with individuals,
[SPEAKER_12]: that are coming into your dispenser or
that you're providing access to medicines
[SPEAKER_12]: for.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also the person who's growing the
medicine, if they're a grumpy asshole
[SPEAKER_12]: who's like constantly a rage-a-holic,
I can't imagine that that medicine is
[SPEAKER_12]: actually going to be beneficial for the
person in the end run.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's consider having some healthy
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're having a shitty day,
don't come to my grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you need to go and de-stress somewhere
and come back grounded, fabulous,
[SPEAKER_12]: but don't come in effect.
[SPEAKER_12]: My plants, the beautiful, gorgeous
cannabis goddesses don't deserve that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Neither do the people that you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_12]: Neither does the person that's going to be
receiving the medicine at the end of the
[SPEAKER_12]: day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I personally believe that everything
has an energy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything we do can imprint.
[SPEAKER_12]: So imagine having a beautiful medicine
that's grown with love and respect and
[SPEAKER_12]: reverence and having this beautiful
communication with the plants and then
[SPEAKER_12]: making medicine and in that medicine
making process, having like, you were
[SPEAKER_12]: sharing Peter, that's so beautiful with
the vortex that you create for the energy
[SPEAKER_12]: and having that as an intention.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in the process of sharing that
medicine with somebody, actually having a
[SPEAKER_12]: conscientious conversation with them,
exploring what they're hoping to achieve
[SPEAKER_12]: and helping to support that exploration
with research, with a conversation and
[SPEAKER_12]: continuing that process of encouraging
them to tune into their body and really
[SPEAKER_12]: have a relationship with the plant that
they're ingesting in the first place.
[SPEAKER_12]: So start to finish.
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally believe that we all have a
role to play and I think that there's
[SPEAKER_12]: growth everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that's kind of my two cents on
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, and just as a general,
you know, cause I wasn't just trying to be
[SPEAKER_11]: straight contrarian on all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I just think again, you know,
it's the biggest thing that we can do is
[SPEAKER_11]: help people in the most harm reductive way
to begin using cannabis so that they could
[SPEAKER_11]: stop using the daily non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs that they turn to
[SPEAKER_11]: or the other medications that are doing
such long term harm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, so I do agree, obviously
for sure that, you know, any cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: should be taken in a very kind of
specific, you know, kind of low kind of,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, less is more almost approach,
you know, but, but, you know, just in
[SPEAKER_11]: working with THC, you know, my,
you know, my whole point just is with,
[SPEAKER_11]: with just like vaporizing the essential
oil extraction off a plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is such a controlled way that you can,
you know, one puff is enough, like those
[SPEAKER_11]: low titrate slow kind of thing where,
you know, cause the effects come on within
[SPEAKER_11]: five to 15 minutes peak at, you know,
one to two hours and that two to four
[SPEAKER_11]: hours, which is so different in,
you know, being able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of control and, you know,
kind of develop, you know, step into then
[SPEAKER_11]: say, you know, just ingesting some,
you know, and a certain unknown kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: dose edible and having such variance in
your own, you know, kind of metabolism or,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you know, potential,
you know, with, with how THC is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: metabolize your body and affect you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just, it's worth this point now
where what we've learned enough now to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to tailor the direction we push
people in a chance that has a higher
[SPEAKER_05]: chance of success, you know, which is
exciting, you know, it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a new day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be working with cannabis and to
be working with it is a, a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_05]: supplement for people who up until,
you know, right now, had really no
[SPEAKER_05]: options, you know, except for some pretty
harmful pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what we had turned into a
singular type of cannabis plant that was
[SPEAKER_05]: been bred to be high THC, low and other
cannabinoids, which also plays into why
[SPEAKER_05]: people have a lot of those negative
effects is the loss of.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're at a point now where not only
are we, I mean, just, what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Wade haven't heard much from Mr.
Laughter down there, but Wade could chime
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was just 2004, 2005,
where we were just getting lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_05]: find CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're having access, not just
access to a variety of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: but scientific data every day coming out
to help back up and help refine our
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment techniques.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we, I think us as who are,
you know, position ourselves as,
[SPEAKER_05]: as leaders or advisors or educators in the
community, I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility that comes along with that
to be on the cutting edge of some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of those things and correct
as needed as this mission comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so I was just trying to point
out some of the, the angles of what we
[SPEAKER_05]: learned that everything we're saying may
be true with exceptions of where we've
[SPEAKER_05]: learned that it might not be now,
because we're learning about all these
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties of different approaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just encourage everyone who's
training, but tenders, especially to be
[SPEAKER_05]: really up to speed as best we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it is difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: With, with what we're learning about those
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we have the potential to help and we
have potential to steer people the wrong,
[SPEAKER_05]: the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I, I just wanted to add one thing in
regards to training, but tenders and just
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of supporting them in the process.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause a lot of the times people,
you know, they think, okay, working at
[SPEAKER_12]: dispensary is cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get to like play with weed all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of people don't consider that
you're also hearing these pretty horrific
[SPEAKER_12]: stories from people who have really gone
through some hurt, you know, some scary
[SPEAKER_12]: things in the medical system with their
health, even the energy behind getting a
[SPEAKER_12]: diagnosis and all the psychological stuff
that someone is going through in the
[SPEAKER_12]: healing process, being a person that's
behind the counter and receiving that
[SPEAKER_12]: information without having someone that
you can properly debrief with or
[SPEAKER_12]: understands how to handle those
situations.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oftentimes we're dealing with people with,
you know, some mental health issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're not aware of what those
issues are or how to handle those in a
[SPEAKER_12]: proper way, that can be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not having, um, even the, even proper
medical training, having your first aid is
[SPEAKER_12]: so important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important for our bud tenders
to have permission to say, we don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: what you need here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times there's, there's this
pressure to sell what we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I've tell a story because
it's one, but I could tell you a hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: different stories, but, um, you know,
I don't want to bring down the whole 150th
[SPEAKER_05]: episode with, with some of the seriousness
of cannabis and medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's important to be reminded that,
you know, I go to funerals of children who
[SPEAKER_05]: were given bad advice and parents didn't
realize that they had other options.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so when we go, when I hear
parents come to me crying because they
[SPEAKER_05]: spent their last $600 for their child
with, who's having 150 seizures a day and
[SPEAKER_05]: they were sold chocolate bars,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Six chocolate bars, as opposed to really
understanding the seriousness of some of
[SPEAKER_05]: those and what might've been needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's consequences to that, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think having bud tenders who have a
permission to say a couple of things,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's okay to say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay to say, and it's okay to say,
we might not have what you need,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, maybe giving them some
resources where people can go look at more
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think some of those things are
really important is we, we've adopted and
[SPEAKER_05]: taken the word medicine with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think appropriately, because it
absolutely can be one of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: amazingly powerful medicines I've ever
seen in my experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But boy, a lot of responsibility comes
with that word as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure that our confidence
isn't outpacing our competence.
[SPEAKER_03]: We train our bud tenders at BPG a week
before they even hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to understand actually what
they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to understand, even if they come
with an understanding of genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, they have to understand how to
deescalate situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do they properly handle, how to
properly listen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, supportive listening, but as well as
empowering them through education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very fortunate that we have a
large selection of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not upselling as much as we have
a diverse variety of flowers and
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates and edibles because we stock
them and look for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I've got 20 to one ratios of
CBD to THC, 15 to ones, 10 to ones,
[SPEAKER_03]: one to ones, five to ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to have the full spectrum
because even though I may have this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular cancer and you may have that
same exact one, what works for me won't
[SPEAKER_03]: work for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to also make those people not
only understand that this may not even
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very difficult thing to
actually have to communicate to people is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you are, and that's the frustration
when I have 50 different flowers to choose
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You now have this particular cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to weed through the wheat
from the chaff to now find this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that may actually work for you or
what may not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the things that I think that
we do disjustice is also giving false
[SPEAKER_03]: hope, which is unfair to the patient and
it is unfair to the bud tender because we
[SPEAKER_03]: put them in those pressure areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the front line.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the, again, the tip of the arrow,
so to say, because they're receiving that
[SPEAKER_03]: information so that they can best process
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I firmly and have been
entrenched for years now in teaching our
[SPEAKER_03]: people how to handle those situations even
before they actually hit the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: register, before they even behind the
counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they shadow that person behind
the counter for another week before they
[SPEAKER_03]: even start speaking and handling and
dealing with transactions so they can get
[SPEAKER_03]: a feel, they can absorb it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a great deal of training that
each one of us have to do in our own
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities because of the one
misinformation, the lack of information,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's also our responsibility to step
up as educators and as purveyors of this
[SPEAKER_03]: information to have the science to back it
up, which is why we're pioneers to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I couldn't take looking in
somebody's face who has HIV and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is completely fine for you to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't say that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for almost 10 years now, I can say
with confidence, yes, this is safe,
[SPEAKER_03]: affordable medicine that you can actually
have access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a long series of steps to get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took a while to get that full
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have them read.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the good information,
the can of Bibles, the big book of Buds so
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can just even understand some of
the genetics that are out there because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking over a thousand plus
different genetics that are out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly changing due to names
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So science has brought us back to a
standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science has brought us back from
understanding that it goes beyond just
[SPEAKER_03]: this high number of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different ratios out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank each and every one of you for
helping people understand and bring that
[SPEAKER_03]: education forward every single day so that
you can challenge not just ourselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those patients to understand their own
disabilities so that they can also heal
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask where would you recommend that
BUD Tenders get their education?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because within our organization,
we purchased a program through what is it
[SPEAKER_12]: now?
[SPEAKER_12]: TMCI, the Medical Cannabis Institute out
of California.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an accredited course.
[SPEAKER_12]: But where else can BUD Tenders get quality
information?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how can we as organizations support
our BUD Tenders?
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my one question.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other piece is what are you guys doing
to support your BUD Tenders after they
[SPEAKER_12]: start burning out?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because realistically, caregiver burnout
is real.
[SPEAKER_12]: Compassion fatigue burnout is real,
which means that you are in a
[SPEAKER_12]: compassionate position.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're hearing these stories every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're interacting with these sick people.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're trying to do the best you can,
but you're also human.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a connection with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And slowly what can happen is your morale
can erode.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your emotional stability and mental
stability can begin to erode.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when we have people calling in
sick, not being able to perform on the job
[SPEAKER_12]: like they normally would, acting out,
having nervous breakdowns while they're at
[SPEAKER_12]: work because they can't handle the stress
and the pressure and the emotional
[SPEAKER_12]: component of supporting these individuals.
[SPEAKER_12]: So twofold, where do you guys get the
training for your BUD Tenders?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how are you supporting them in those
types of positions?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also have to add that in our
organization, we also teach something
[SPEAKER_12]: called compassion fatigue burnout
prevention.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every month we do something to help
support our staff.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have an open door policy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where debriefing is encouraged on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Real quick, just chime in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think O'Shaughnessy's, Project CBD,
Society of Cannabis Clinicians,
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing resources, continuing education
type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We created our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to speak to what it does, it's all
about creating proper job descriptions and
[SPEAKER_03]: strong hiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to find people from the beginning
and it literally starts there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally we used to hire people who were
activists because we needed people who had
[SPEAKER_03]: fire who were gonna deal with the feds
coming in and busting us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So originally we taught a lot of social
justice to everybody, how to listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: if the cops come, how not to speak,
be silent, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shifted in 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we became more professional by going
out after the cold memo came out and we
[SPEAKER_03]: started to hire professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we created our own system internally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I taught and used to teach at Oksidam
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a great vanilla start to
things, but unfortunately the realities of
[SPEAKER_03]: bud tending and dealing with patients
one-on-one every single day is something
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to teach in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to understand, I see between
500 to 1,000 patients a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see and deal with quite a few
diversity across the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have the diversity of flowers
and cannabis and edibles and things that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that education is hands-on,
we have been completely supportive and
[SPEAKER_03]: education is something we're always
furthering our own people because we also
[SPEAKER_03]: promote from within.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll find we also hire for specific
positions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to hire originally when I started
BPG, we used to hire somebody who worked
[SPEAKER_03]: in the front and they could also work in
the back and they could also work in the
[SPEAKER_03]: way room and they could also work upstairs
in the money counting, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, or breaking down bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we found out is by hiring people
for those mass different situations,
[SPEAKER_03]: people tended to ghost in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like working behind the bud
tenders, so they would do bad there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then they would excel weighing in the
bud, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we changed everything out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We created actual hiring departments for
each department where everybody had their
[SPEAKER_03]: own manager and the manager does the
hiring for that department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a bud tender, they're
actually hiring and we actually hire
[SPEAKER_03]: through Craigslist now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can find a large diverse
cornucopia of people and narrow down those
[SPEAKER_03]: results to people who we find are good
communicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they have retail experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is helpful if they're patients and have
pre-existing information or knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding cannabis, but that all is thrown
out the window because we educate them
[SPEAKER_03]: completely on how to communicate,
how to deescalate, how to handle every
[SPEAKER_03]: type of situation that comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, we used to have a smoking
lounge out front.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to deal with people passing out
from coming from, we would have people
[SPEAKER_03]: literally come from surgery and come and
Medicaid and they would get up and pass
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we taught people as soon as they
bounce, we call 911.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 911 has its own set of circumstances
that come with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the medicine is put away.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those realities that you come with
that the fire department is coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to clear the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make everybody outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please put out your joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have the police and the
fire department come through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please realize that that's about to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the fire department and everybody
comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We escort them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gained the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They assess the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's all different protocol we
have had to assess along the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: because again, we didn't start off with
any rules, but these are things that we
[SPEAKER_03]: had to deal with to acclimate so that when
the fire department came, they were
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they originally came to us,
they were very sarcastic, very dickish,
[SPEAKER_03]: no bullshit, because they're like,
what are these people fucking sitting here
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking pot and getting high and passing
out?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they find out that these are patients
and they have contraindications and that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have contraindication forms so that
people can fill those out at the front
[SPEAKER_03]: desk so that if they have some sort of
adverse reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have 5150s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had people who decide to get off
their meds and go crazy and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: attack people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to put myself in between a
patient and another patient while one was
[SPEAKER_03]: swinging a broken bong that with the glass
shards flying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had guns pulled on me in all kinds of
situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had to learn how to deescalate
situations because patients can be very
[SPEAKER_03]: all over the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that happens, we call mental
services in Berkeley and Berkeley sends
[SPEAKER_03]: out a response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it requires restraints,
et cetera, and a moving rubber room,
[SPEAKER_03]: they bring that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has happened, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had to deal with every single
situation and educate our own staff on how
[SPEAKER_03]: to handle these types of situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I'm coming up on 18 years,
so I've seen a whole bunch of craziness
[SPEAKER_03]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we're still learning
from every single experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're learning to handle some of the most
insane things you would never think you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a city council person who came
in and his wife actually ingested too much
[SPEAKER_03]: of an edible and had a contraindication
that she had to actually go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when she showed up and he and her
actually made us aware of the situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: we presented them with the form and they
were blown away that we had thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, this is serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a bad understanding or a bad
situation with cannabis, we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand it so that we can acclimate and
understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not the only issue,
you're the one that's come up in our
[SPEAKER_03]: reality, and we need to prepare for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's happened once,
it's 21 going to happen again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw a great shift happen as well
when the government forced us out of our
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a new location.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too small to have smoking in front.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we then phased out those types of
training because we no longer had to deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with fire departments showing up for
somebody passing out or those types of
[SPEAKER_03]: situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's also a readjustment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on your situation, depending on
your locality, depending on your
[SPEAKER_03]: municipality, we also do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give things to the poor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had clothing exchange and things
like that so that we have to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: the realities of dealing with our
homeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also deal with a lot of patients who
have been kicked to the curb because they
[SPEAKER_03]: have AIDS and they have no other support
mechanism, no family, no anything else
[SPEAKER_03]: except to come and to see and to talk to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we also have to open up in our
compassion and realize when somebody is
[SPEAKER_03]: humbling themselves, you have to be there,
be there in that moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We teach them to adjust themselves,
to be in that moment with that patient,
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that empathy, to show that
compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we don't, someone else will
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing I learned after being
kicked out of the VA multiple times is
[SPEAKER_03]: that if I don't create the compassion and
the love that I want to experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: no one else is going to give it to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our responsibility.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why there's such an inherent
service in what we're doing and what
[SPEAKER_11]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you so much for all that you've
learned along the way to do it with the
[SPEAKER_11]: best integrity you can and that you've
learned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, it's such a powerful
thing that we're doing and helping to
[SPEAKER_11]: participate in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, with that comes such profound
responsibility and service that we can
[SPEAKER_11]: overlook if we take a different approach
or don't take the seriousness,
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selena, I would like to learn more about
your debriefing for de-stressing because
[SPEAKER_03]: we are so high-paced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that could be
beneficial, something that I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily offer currently to my
budtenders that I would love to learn more
[SPEAKER_03]: about that so that I could maybe implement
some of that to help decompress some of
[SPEAKER_03]: their stresses that they deal with on an
everyday basis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be honored.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the quick and dirty version of it is
basically what we're doing is we are
[SPEAKER_12]: acknowledging the truth, which is this
idea of going to work and leaving your
[SPEAKER_12]: baggage at the door and just turning it
off isn't necessarily realistic for a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And instead of having that approach,
we really take the approach of
[SPEAKER_12]: self-actualization.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here to grow and learn together.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're a community.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really encourage a community that's
supportive in that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we do specifically within
the group is we will have a sacred
[SPEAKER_12]: container where we've agreed that
everything that's shared in the group is
[SPEAKER_12]: private and confidential.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we do is we go around and we
share the things.
[SPEAKER_12]: We usually take about an hour to do this,
by the way, and our staff is about six.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a little bit faster for us,
I'm sure, than for yours.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can also do smaller trainings for
little groups, which could also be really
[SPEAKER_12]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what we do then is we go around the
group and we acknowledge the things that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're holding onto and the things that are
keeping us from being present in this
[SPEAKER_12]: moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, like, for example,
oh, God, there's so many examples.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, for example, maybe like for me
anyways, like I'm a living caregiver for
[SPEAKER_12]: my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_12]: So depending on where her health is at is
as much as I can be present.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I'm thinking about, you know,
her going to the doctor or her having her
[SPEAKER_12]: hip surgery or whatever, I'm not going to
be necessarily as present as I could be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, maybe we had a patient that
just passed away that I'd been working
[SPEAKER_12]: with directly and helping guiding a
process for knowing that maybe they're
[SPEAKER_12]: palliative, but finally getting to that
stage where they've released.
[SPEAKER_12]: And having that grief process,
something that's very real, very healthy,
[SPEAKER_12]: and having a supportive group that I can
share that with.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we do is we're not like
dwelling and it's not sharing to give
[SPEAKER_12]: advice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sitting there being like,
well, if you do this, then blah,
[SPEAKER_12]: blah, blah, maybe you'll feel better.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really just allowing someone to have
that full experience where they can share
[SPEAKER_12]: authentically without judgment,
without input, other than a thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we do is we shift that
energy towards gratitude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do that in a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it's an art therapy thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it's just an acknowledgement of
the things that we're grateful for.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, like the first thing that
I'm always grateful for is our community.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, thank you guys for showing up
and being here so we can do this work
[SPEAKER_12]: without someone else being present to this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: The healing couldn't necessarily happen in
such a profound way.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we shift the energy to gratitude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we usually end off with is
what I call our one thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So part of the prevention of compassion,
fatigue, burnout, I think the most
[SPEAKER_12]: important thing is self-care.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's taking care of yourself first.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's having the sleep.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's eating the good food.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's resting when you need to.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's having healthy boundaries and saying,
no, I can't go out tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to just take some time and be
alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or no, I can't put in that extra two hours
of work today.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, or acknowledging, you know,
if we are going through something that
[SPEAKER_12]: we're allowed to have space.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we do is we encourage healthy
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_12]: And self-care.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the one thing is what is your one thing
you're going to do for you today that's
[SPEAKER_12]: just for you that's going to fill your
cup?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because when our cup is overflowing,
not half full, not almost full,
[SPEAKER_12]: but when our cup is overflowing,
I believe that's when we actually can give
[SPEAKER_12]: something back.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how are you going to fill your cup so
you can continue to do the work?
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be as simple as I'm going to go
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of our directors said he was going to
go dab out because he was pretty tired the
[SPEAKER_12]: other day and put in a lot of work and was
in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was in a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was his one thing is he was going
to have a really beautiful dab sesh and
[SPEAKER_12]: have a good sleep.
[SPEAKER_12]: For myself, I had a couple of beautiful
gluten-free brownies the other night so I
[SPEAKER_12]: could have a good rest.
[SPEAKER_12]: But just having one of those acknowledging
moments where it could be something as
[SPEAKER_12]: simple as I'm going to go outside in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to eat something fresh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go outside and I'm going to
breathe in some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to look at this plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be in nature.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to take that nap.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to listen to that podcast I've
been waiting to do, whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's the one thing for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of caregivers get caught up in,
well, then I'm going to do all these
[SPEAKER_12]: things for this person that I'm caring
for.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's literally just the one thing for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for us in our organization,
that's how we've structured it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we teach.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very easy to replicate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also encourage that every
organization integrate it within their own
[SPEAKER_12]: culture.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's language.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's ways that everybody operates
within their own organization that's a
[SPEAKER_12]: little bit different, which is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found long term, that's really
what's helped us keep staff on board.
[SPEAKER_12]: If people are starting to burn out,
we acknowledge it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't tell them that they need to suck
it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think instead, it's acknowledging that
someone's burning out and seeing that
[SPEAKER_12]: those behaviors or whatever is that,
and being able to help support that person
[SPEAKER_12]: in refilling their cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a lot of good points.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked for 16 years before I quit to be
a caregiver full time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just say thank you for that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it takes a very I know,
but you obviously rose to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now we're working with, I hadn't
taken a break here on Hash Church because
[SPEAKER_05]: we had a family come in who has a daughter
with cerebral palsy and is having hundreds
[SPEAKER_05]: of seizures and we're getting them set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's gone from caregiving for one child
to, you know, quite a few, quite a few
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before that, I worked for 16 years in
pediatric mental health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we worked with kids with bipolar
disorders, schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't diagnose schizophrenia pre 18,
but when you work with enough of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you see those sort of things developing
and you do see it in kids at times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are kids who would have lash outs
where they would, you know, break your
[SPEAKER_05]: nose or attack you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're as a caregiver trying to get
through those sort of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that we found just
works the best and it really has to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with everything is work is work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's why they pay us to be
there if it was just awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody be lining up to do it and we get
paid to treat the people who are coming in
[SPEAKER_05]: through the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of times it's about teaching your
employees who are sometimes just kids
[SPEAKER_05]: coming through and introducing the
concepts of just how to regulate and
[SPEAKER_05]: manage stress in their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get a lot, a lot of what you're
doing is exactly that, but disassociating
[SPEAKER_05]: it from work because a lot of times once
you're at work, it's not the time where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to be able to modulate and
have a choice over how much stress comes
[SPEAKER_05]: at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be prepared when you get
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are we dealing with stress at home?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, taking time for yourself
and actually making a plan to take time to
[SPEAKER_05]: do things that will alleviate stress,
which is unique for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes people need to just shut
everything down and hang out in their
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes people are hanging out in their
house or dwelling about work starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: get Monday all weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's completely unproductive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time they get the work on
Monday, they're emotionally drained
[SPEAKER_05]: because they've been dwelling on it for
days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are great classes and courses
out there on just basic stress management
[SPEAKER_05]: skills to add into your employee training
that can help quite a bit with those
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like that's what you're doing,
but I think it's, it all comes down to
[SPEAKER_05]: disassociating work with being the cause
of the problem and making it what is in
[SPEAKER_05]: reality, just our lives are always full of
stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are different causes of stress,
but if we don't have a plan on how we can
[SPEAKER_05]: manage those, then we're not going to
sustain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we work with families who are 24
hour caregivers for 10, 15, 18 years at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time, no days off, uh, three in the
morning, five in the morning, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the, you know, intense, intense,
uh, way of living, you know, how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: not burn out?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is why we have over an 86%
divorce rate in families with kids with
[SPEAKER_05]: rare disease, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that stress ends up causing people
to attack each other and families fall
[SPEAKER_05]: apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's other, even more horrible
stories of people who've broken down
[SPEAKER_05]: emotionally that we don't need to get into
here necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we're talking about is how can we
help people prevent that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's definitely, and then again,
I'm just repeating some of what was
[SPEAKER_05]: already said here, uh, by Selena,
but it's, it's really teach people that it
[SPEAKER_05]: is not selfish to put yourself first and
take the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just add really quick for women,
especially that is a really hard,
[SPEAKER_12]: hard thing to get over because a lot of
women's value has been put in what we do
[SPEAKER_12]: for others.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a mother, I'm a caregiver,
I'm whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's constantly giving.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to say self first and selfish.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been taught in our language that
it's a negative, but it's not,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's putting yourself first.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can give, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sick people are caregiving out of the
equation, even just being a parent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that we burn out, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people think, well, if I'm,
if I'm doing something for myself,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being selfish.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in reality, it's more selfish to wear
yourself out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad that you're a poor parent or a
poor caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just kind of introducing as an
employer, that paradigm shift that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: actually helping the other people by
setting time aside where you have someone
[SPEAKER_05]: else being with them and taking care of
those things and spending some time on
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself for whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really, and sometimes when that
light bulb clicks that, Oh, if I give,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's just say if I'm awake 24 hours in
the day, as opposed to being a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_05]: caregiver, if I'm a 22 hour caregiver and
I have two hours just for myself for what
[SPEAKER_05]: I need, I'm a hundred percent better at my
job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those other 22 hours, another time during
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of just shift that paradigm to
relieve the guilt that some people
[SPEAKER_05]: associate on themselves when they start
doing things for themselves or telling
[SPEAKER_05]: people they're busy and can't,
you know, I can't focus on what you need
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to do it for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the guilt that costs people to not do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That stress builds up over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can't deal anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: So imagine we can be, we can be the person
on the frontline budtender to say to that
[SPEAKER_12]: mother or that father or that grandparent,
it's okay to take that two hours for
[SPEAKER_12]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's okay to give up the guilt.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually better to take that time
than to continue to push through to the
[SPEAKER_12]: point where you're so burnt out that you
can't give anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like, like imagine you could be the
person on the frontline to, to support
[SPEAKER_12]: that other caregiver.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the other thing that we haven't
really got into, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure you guys know most of the times
that we're dealing with, especially
[SPEAKER_12]: complex health issues, there's usually a
caregiver that's a liaison between the
[SPEAKER_12]: dispensary or the access point and that
individual.
[SPEAKER_12]: So being able to support them too,
you know, we have a patient that we're,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're working with right now whose
husband, you know, she's young,
[SPEAKER_12]: beautiful, vibrant, and is experiencing
some really awful Lyme disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_12]: And her partner has been fully supportive
for so several years.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can imagine how friends fall away
because it's not always a great story to
[SPEAKER_12]: tell.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can imagine how those core support
systems begin to erode and being able to
[SPEAKER_12]: be that person on the other end of the
phone call and say, you know what,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's okay that you're having a shitty day.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds like it's really overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you going to do for yourself
today?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've, we've also had,
you know, caregivers who then don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and you know, you can have those
types of, you know, issues as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the, we shut down, we had hospice
for a while because we had patients that
[SPEAKER_03]: died and we had their relatives come to us
and tell us, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of that, we started a hospice
service for those that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at that stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the burnout was so hard and heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once people passed, it was nearly
impossible to staff further because people
[SPEAKER_03]: get so emotionally attached to this
person, this child, this grandparent or
[SPEAKER_03]: adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go out of their way and they don't
take care of themselves because they feel
[SPEAKER_03]: that absolute need because this person is
so in need and they're at such that end of
[SPEAKER_03]: life situation that I had to shut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was frustrating to my own soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully I have friends of mine that
are working on in the future to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: nursing home, a cannabis nursing home so
that people can transition out because we
[SPEAKER_03]: need that end of life service because the
last, the thing that hurt my heart was
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering if that person on their deathbed
was wondering if they could have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: their cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fucking crushed my soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the kind of shit that will
keep you up at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by, you know, going out there and
providing it, we tried, but it's such a
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary need that people want to
transition out of life and they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of institutions refuse to let
them blackball them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kicked out of institutions,
they're kicked out of federal housing,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is still, you know, something that
needs to be considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I great respect for, you know,
Caladrius and what you guys are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're taking care of the youth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also need to think of transition to
those people as we all die.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to do it in a facility where
I have access to my medicine as well
[SPEAKER_03]: without fear of being kicked out of the
facility that I'm in or being made to feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like a second class citizen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something we need to start looking
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to start investing in this
type of situation so that people can have
[SPEAKER_03]: that dignity and have that respect so that
they don't have to have and live and die
[SPEAKER_03]: with that fear.
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that regard, you know,
I have such, you know, one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_11]: why Valerie Corral is such a deep hero,
heroine and inspiration for me in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the soul, you know, for this plant
community also in such a big way is from
[SPEAKER_11]: the end of life work that she's kind of
really taken on as a life calling,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, in the hospice work.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a foundation, Raha Kuto,
the Design for Dying project, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the sacred space that is held for
helping, you know, to both, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: die while and accept, come into acceptance
with death and the dying process,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also help to empower it in ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, it's such a deep,
deep, deep service to be in service to the
[SPEAKER_11]: dying.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, I feel like everybody deserves the
right to die with dignity and to die as
[SPEAKER_12]: comfortably as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like we're at this point now
where yes, opiate use is is a big drug
[SPEAKER_12]: that they're using for people that are,
you know, trying to die comfortably,
[SPEAKER_12]: which I understand, but there's a lot of
side effects to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, constipation is one of the main
things, which is very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagine if we had and I love the idea of
actually having hospice work alongside or
[SPEAKER_12]: having, you know, like a cannabis friendly
hospice house, which in our area we
[SPEAKER_12]: actually do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't name the hospice house,
but there are some.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it really comes down to the
attitudes of the organization,
[SPEAKER_12]: having the conversation with the
directors, making sure that the staff is
[SPEAKER_12]: informed and educated, that there's a
quality source of product and that that
[SPEAKER_12]: product is appropriate for that
individual.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it could absolutely make the
biggest difference in the lives of those
[SPEAKER_12]: individuals that are transitioning out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I had mentioned a couple of
episodes ago, like cannabis and opium were
[SPEAKER_12]: used in antiquity to help people
transition comfortably and with dignity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now I'm seeing this this reclamation
happening, which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's soon enough or fast
enough, but I'm excited and I know that
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a there's hope.
[SPEAKER_12]: So continuing to be that bridge,
advocating for people that are on the
[SPEAKER_12]: deathbed, if that's something that they're
interested in, having those positive
[SPEAKER_12]: experiences that don't scare them away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Microdosing, making sure that the medicine
is clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that is so important.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why, you know, I'm so adamant
about challenging and taking on the
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibitionists and naysayers of the risks
of cannabis, when in reality, there's very
[SPEAKER_05]: little to no evidence to back up a lot of
the claims of risk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in on the flip side of that,
you have a huge amount of risk and
[SPEAKER_05]: suffering to those who could benefit from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why, you know, it's exciting
to see more people now who are starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to articulate properly the
humanitarian issue that cannabis access
[SPEAKER_05]: truly is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a reason that I post
hundreds of videos of my son's seizures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not because I enjoy watching them and
editing them is a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe firmly that if people are
going to hold on to ideologies that cause
[SPEAKER_05]: immediate harm and death to some of the
most vulnerable in our society,
[SPEAKER_05]: they shouldn't be spared the consequences.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, with the collaboration we're
working with primarily is we're working
[SPEAKER_05]: with the we start with triage,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start with those who won't
live to be adults if we don't intervene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're already working with models for
other at risk communities.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the 24 suicides a day in our
veterans community is absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have, you know, care homes and
facilities that are just a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: nightmare in some of these places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are sick and dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there's all aspects where
we have enough activists now where we can
[SPEAKER_05]: start to really pick these communities up
and uplift them and now have the science
[SPEAKER_05]: and data and anecdotal and, you know,
peer reviewed scientific data to help show
[SPEAKER_05]: that this isn't just a, hey, it would be
cool if we could do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a humanitarian issue and it needs
to be treated that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people who want to prohibit need
to be able to back up why they want to
[SPEAKER_05]: cause and allow these people to suffer
with some sort of evidence, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: some sort of proof that their stance is
valid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're at a shifting point now where
there's just no ground for them to stand
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, this is why we advocate so
strongly for use in cannabis in children,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: All we care about is protecting the
children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is why I jumped to the
opportunity to debate and educate and
[SPEAKER_05]: let's talk about harm to children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what the risks are of cannabis
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes all the way through veterans
and adults and seniors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully by the time we are in that
position, we won't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_05]: that so much because I want to be in the
home with ET in there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pass the ball, bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll enjoy some brownies in the corner and
it'll be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some great combo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's serious, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back to how we deal with that as
people who are working with others,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's not easy, but it's a
paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that once you make it,
and I know I've spoken to Valerie about
[SPEAKER_05]: this now because, right, what she's doing
with people on their deathbeds is
[SPEAKER_05]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she's helped hundreds transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way you do that when you talk to
these people is the same with,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm working with a couple of
kids right now who are very young,
[SPEAKER_05]: two and three.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have serious forms of cancer and the
prognosis isn't good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you go into those conditions
repeatedly, your paradigm starts to shift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from it being horror and stress and
tragedy, you start to see beauty and love
[SPEAKER_05]: and life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you start to feel the beauty in easing
someone's pain and easing someone's
[SPEAKER_05]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing this transition is just
something that we're all going to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through and we're lucky enough to have the
opportunity to make that transition
[SPEAKER_05]: comfortable and safe and not full of fear
and terror.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you start to see that beauty and
you can, you know, that's an extreme
[SPEAKER_05]: example of what we can start to work with
people who are just budtending or working
[SPEAKER_05]: with sick people for the first time is
that, yes, what they're going through is
[SPEAKER_05]: tragic, but our opportunity to help is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our ability to interact and improve
their quality of life is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking at each of those interactions
is a blessing and not a kick in the
[SPEAKER_05]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a really big impact on your
long-term sustainability to work with
[SPEAKER_05]: these people, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that takes some growing up and some
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think those of us who've worked with
patients for a long time, it naturally has
[SPEAKER_05]: to happen or you just don't last.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, truly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give thanks for us.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give thanks, everyone, for today.

of course, another time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, everyone, for coming in and

if they want to get connected with
[SPEAKER_19]: everyone on the panel, I'll try to connect
emails, websites, links on the Hash Church
[SPEAKER_19]: Facebook group, as well as putting up the
papers that were mentioned, Ethan Russo's
[SPEAKER_19]: paper, as well as, oh, I think I put up a
couple of them, the Terpene paper from the
[SPEAKER_19]: Netherlands that Peter spoke about.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of that is in the Hash Church group.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're not part of it, ask to be a
member and we'll accept you.
[SPEAKER_19]: And thanks, everyone, for making Hash
Church what it is.

convo, I also sent a link to a really,
[SPEAKER_11]: really beautiful medicine music album in
tribute to the water protectors around the
[SPEAKER_11]: world.
