[SPEAKER_12]: button.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, so there's a few things I'm going to
have to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to have to turn the volume down
real quick on this new one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do a quick copy and paste over to this old
one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get them all organized into the chat,
and then we'll start this episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for your patience, everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if I can fit that in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: All alone today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually there's a few people that have
come into the room by now, but that's okay
[SPEAKER_12]: because we certainly know that I can talk
and talk and talk if need be.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will say, welcome everybody to
HashChurch 3.0 episode 23.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see how we do here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Johnny B's texting me, which is perfectly
on time.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just wait for the friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did send out the link yesterday fairly
late, so I don't exactly know who is going
[SPEAKER_12]: to be involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like things are a little,
okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, Magma Seeds, Hermano,
Jason Pass, Boulder, The Underhill.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, everyone was in the wrong room.
[SPEAKER_12]: For whatever reason, I'm not quite sure
how to set it up, so when I create the
[SPEAKER_12]: YouTube live video, that it goes live with
the actual Zoom video.
[SPEAKER_12]: It creates a new YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_12]: But welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to put these on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably have.
[SPEAKER_12]: See if I can't get these on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is everyone here, Wade, or is it just me?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go real quick here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're good, Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had my speaker set up as my microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was going to say I couldn't hear
you, but I can hear you great now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time at the Patients Out of
Time conference this past week,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Colton Turner was one of the
presenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Colton?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Thursday through Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday was on regulations and obstacles
to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday was the latest research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pretty amazing papers were presented,
and then Saturday was the clinicians,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the case presentations was done
by Colton about himself.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great, especially at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had this Q&A thing for the faculty
that presented, and you got all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguished clinicians, many of whom I
know, on the Zoom call, and then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: Colton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really far out, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he'll probably be in that crew one
of these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark, it was really weird when I just
joined.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was this automated recording that
came on saying that this is being
[SPEAKER_08]: recorded.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that too, Wade?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the reason that is is because
usually, yeah, usually you guys have been
[SPEAKER_11]: showing up lately, and then I go live on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: And go recording.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I went live, and I started recording
earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's a legal message to let you
know that, hey, if you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_11]: recorded, don't come into the chat room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the last little window before you go
live says, do you consent to be recorded
[SPEAKER_08]: or something like that?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the big time, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's like, it can be intimidating
for people like Sam, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's why he's not here yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do your cordage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even thought of that.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still farting around with my,
I just want to make sure that I sound
[SPEAKER_12]: better.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all bummed out.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying it's grainy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you're better.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just changed my microphone from
these ones to my actual microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that should be better.
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be quite as bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully the connection comes in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually trying out a new internet
service today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just set up my Starlink yesterday on the
roof there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in beta.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do have another internet to back it
up in case I have problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for now, this is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And no, this is not a recording.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is live.
[SPEAKER_12]: Live with Dr. Mark and with Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here in Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_12]: I set the link out really late last night
as I've been putting my son to bed for the
[SPEAKER_12]: last month.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just trying to give my wife a little bit
of a break of every single night,
[SPEAKER_12]: having to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes when you work all day,
your wife is like, oh, I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: You worked all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, so did you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You also worked all day with kids,
which is even harder than working all day
[SPEAKER_12]: at a job.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for the last 23 days, I've been putting
my son to bed and I generally fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sleep with him at around nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't stay awake when I put him to bed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, if it was a little bit of a
decade after like four in the morning,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we definitely get up pretty early.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been up for hours right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not quite four, but probably a little bit
just a little bit after six a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once the birds start singing,
especially here in the springtime,
[SPEAKER_08]: it becomes difficult because it's just
it's such a great thing to hear birds in
[SPEAKER_08]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know with with with some people
who sleep with their windows open,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just it's so loud that there's no way
he could back.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: We both both in the morning and at dusk.
[SPEAKER_12]: The birds are so loud here at dusk.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're flying around from tree to tree
and really right smack in in a in a
[SPEAKER_12]: forest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a no shortage of incredible birds.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, my son found a bird yesterday.
[SPEAKER_12]: A little baby had fallen out of his nest
in one of our hedges.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he.
[SPEAKER_12]: Found him, saved him, helped birds aren't
real.
[SPEAKER_08]: The birds aren't real.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard I've heard of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some kind of alien robots that fly
around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this one really feels.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks real, though.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you, I know they're not real
and all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to be laughed at or what not.
[SPEAKER_12]: But where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: How did we get into that?
[SPEAKER_12]: How did it?
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand all these wild conspiracies.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when did we like who who was like
birds aren't real?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, where did that one come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not an ornithologist for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_12]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just we got double Josh there for a
quick second.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Double Josh Rutherford, nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we got Josh Rutherford and then we
got Dragonfly Earth Medicines.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I thought there's the other one
coming, too.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we got three Josh's.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are the Josh party minorities
here in the in the in the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Couple of live living soil guys in the
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing really, really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farm's looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about ready to get away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a week of rain and all the
plants now that we're in a waxing moon
[SPEAKER_03]: phase are there's enough heat at night and
enough warmth during the day that the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are kind of doing their Fibonacci
doubling process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're getting a lot of growth right now
and it's a lot of fun to watch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I you know, John brought me these monster
plants, just just a couple of them,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, two or three of them the other
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've only been on my desk for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm saying I'm thinking they've grown
about a foot to a foot and a half.
[SPEAKER_12]: These bushes, they were just big round
bushes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they've got these, you know,
these pieces, these giant just coming all
[SPEAKER_12]: off the top.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's I haven't grown in so long.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm so I envy what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love growing and I love getting my
fingers dirty.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love the whole concept and idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just personally have not had a lot of
time to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So good old Johnny B shows up with some
plants and I'm back in the game.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like this the nervousness of
wanting the plants to be healthy and happy
[SPEAKER_12]: and give them everything they need while
just being like, oh, my God, I got to give
[SPEAKER_12]: these plants attention and love and focus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even three monsters.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm I really have to make time for it
because they, you know, they drink 15 to
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 gallons of water every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thirsty.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like your son.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have needs.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have needs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And their needs must come before my needs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you fall asleep with them,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was on my roof yesterday and I was happy
to see them poking up above the second
[SPEAKER_12]: roof.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see them.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they've got to be over 10 feet
tall right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So only Johnny B would just bring me three
10 foot tall plants in the back of his
[SPEAKER_12]: truck.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm in the meantime, I'm like,
please tell me you didn't put those into
[SPEAKER_12]: the truck yourself, because he's he's so
tall.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got a disc thing going on right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got some pretty major pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was in and out of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just the last thing I want John to
do is destroy himself through kindness.
[SPEAKER_12]: So luckily, he got his neighbors,
Mike and Hedy, to put the plants in the in
[SPEAKER_12]: the back of the truck.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got my 17 year old son, he Tosh,
as we call him, to to lift out the to lift
[SPEAKER_12]: out these plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Johnny B style.
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't wait for them to get like dry.
[SPEAKER_12]: He he moved them like fully, fully like 80
plus pounds per per plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's what's great about having a 17
year old son.
[SPEAKER_12]: For any of you whose son has not reached
that age yet, man, you can't you can't
[SPEAKER_12]: imagine how amazing it is when your son
just can lift and carry everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: No wonder people back in the day on farms
just put their kids to work.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's funny that we got all into
this thing like, oh, they're making kids
[SPEAKER_12]: make shoes and it's like child labor.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, have you ever grown up on a
farm?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because child labor is how that shit
operates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases in Ontario, and I've
heard the story many times, there's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, women who have 20 kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've heard that Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, 20 and 23 children on the farm
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just it's a true mind blower.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your crew, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely say Sky's 24 now and he's
a complete and total force of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we we joke around about being strong,
because we're really into being strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we have this inner Sasquatch
strength that you can like tap into when
[SPEAKER_03]: you really need to go farther than your
actual strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: We we
[SPEAKER_03]: knew amazing and and I'll hit with this
with Sierra on the farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and and Kendall and we have this amazing,
you know, early 20 we have amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, small crew that really is
amazing the work they can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's it's amazingly valuable.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't doubt that whatsoever that Sky is
a force to be reckoned with 24 years old
[SPEAKER_12]: now, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, that's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_12]: My daughter just turned 20 and my son will
turn 18 in September and my other son will
[SPEAKER_12]: turn seven in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just feel really blessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel really blessed to have have
them around and have them be so charged up
[SPEAKER_03]: about our lifestyle and everything that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's obviously they're
calling in life as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I just wanted to bring up on
the show today, which is not about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but it is about environments is
I'd love to bring a attention to the Ferry
[SPEAKER_03]: Creek watershed and the forestry that's
going on over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only two percent, you know,
old growth left in British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_03]: virgin old growth forest left at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on occupied lands, First Nations
lands, Ferry Creek watershed outside of
[SPEAKER_03]: Port Renfro on Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: The local government here in NBC is the
NDP, and they are raising the cutting of
[SPEAKER_03]: by 43 percent of old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's only two point three percent
old growth even left in B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're they're they're basically out
to attack and and murder the rest of our
[SPEAKER_03]: intact environment in America,
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most all of the old growth is already in
protected forests.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really no no
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not already in national parks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's tree sitters, the first tree
sitters of people that are sitting in
[SPEAKER_03]: trees for over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's activist people sitting in
trees trying to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loggers are laughing at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stealing their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're they're they're taking down their
camps.
[SPEAKER_03]: The RCMP are basically private mercenaries
for this for this land occupation and for
[SPEAKER_03]: this type of big business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're out cutting fifteen hundred year
old trees right next to people sitting in
[SPEAKER_03]: trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking chainsaws to I mean,
I don't know if anyone's ever smelt a
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow cedar, but a yellow cedar doesn't
actually doesn't grow in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't grow in California or
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Alaska and British Columbia
thing that the smell, the incense like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that the odor that there's something
totally otherworldly about the yellow
[SPEAKER_03]: cedar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just really want to activate people
to make phone calls to John Horgan's
[SPEAKER_03]: office and to Katrine Conroy and to the BC
RCMP and to all other people that they
[SPEAKER_03]: find in their own network.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Teal Jones group was doing the
cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and let the people know that we're not
OK with losing our last intact
[SPEAKER_03]: environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once these trees are logged, they'll never
be replaced.
[SPEAKER_03]: These environments will never be replaced.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 14 and 18 feet across,
which are really, really big for seniors
[SPEAKER_03]: where Craig is down in the in the Redwoods
and over in the Sierra Nevadas with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequoias.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's trees up here that rival those
redwoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 300 foot tall cedars in this
forest that's being ready to to get cut,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are among the tallest trees in the
world like the redwoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all I can think about right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel extremely passionate as well as my
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now in British Columbia,
wood prices are through the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everywhere you go in the forest right
now, you're hearing chainsaws and trees
[SPEAKER_03]: falling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a genocide on cedar trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cedar trees are so valuable right now
that private landowners are just raking
[SPEAKER_03]: down their land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Private logging companies are raking down
their land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's and raw log exports is another
thing for people to be aware of raw log
[SPEAKER_03]: exports.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something like two hundred and
thirty cubic three two hundred and thirty
[SPEAKER_03]: million cubic feet of raw log exports a
year coming out of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about massive ships with
just raw logs thrown on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So am I talking about no logging?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that there is a place for
logging and and sustainable harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I and I know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand living in wooden houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're talking about is logging an
intact environment that will never be
[SPEAKER_03]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you when you talk about beautiful,
when you talk about British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's beautiful British Columbia or
supernatural British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the government is sanctioning the
destruction of our environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not OK with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just really want to encourage people
to step up and to call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at our story and make phone calls if
you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feel like you have time to make
those phone calls to let the people know
[SPEAKER_03]: that our voices have been heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for letting me say that
it's really important to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate Hashchurch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of our activism is in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of our activism is in psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another part of our activism is in
saving our lands, because without our
[SPEAKER_03]: lands, there is no health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just one more time, the RCMP are
targeting indigenous people on their
[SPEAKER_03]: lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's the work it's everything that
you read in your history books happening
[SPEAKER_03]: right now in the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not history.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's present day occupation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for sharing that, Josh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely pretty fucked up to be thinking
about these trees just that take hundreds
[SPEAKER_12]: of years to be produced, to grow into the
magnificent beings that they are.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then to just have like chainsaws,
you know, the just I'm a I'm a I've lived
[SPEAKER_12]: on my property for 11 years and I've never
cut a tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in a neighborhood where people are
obsessed with cutting trees because they
[SPEAKER_12]: want to have a view.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like trees in my view.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if these people, when they're
done with getting rid of all the trees in
[SPEAKER_12]: their view, if we'll also drain the ocean
so we can see the bottom better.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it does seem a little bit mental in my
neighborhood today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm happy to say I only noticed this a
couple Sundays ago, and it's really not
[SPEAKER_12]: probably that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: But every Sunday, I hear chainsaws in my
neighborhood every single Sunday.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess, you know, some lady got onto
the Lions Bay board, and she passed a
[SPEAKER_12]: little ordinance.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's Sundays are quiet Sundays.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't go like leaf blow and turn on
your you can't turn on your chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_12]: The noise was the least of my worry it was
and for any of you that have ever watched
[SPEAKER_12]: my videos, and I have over 1000 of them on
YouTube, you'll remember random chainsaw
[SPEAKER_12]: guy that I used to always mention because
any time I went out onto my deck to make a
[SPEAKER_12]: video, any time of day or night,
some motherfucker would have a chainsaw
[SPEAKER_12]: going like two seconds, I turn the camera
on, I'd be like, Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was kind of perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just you know, some of these native
women like these elders that are getting
[SPEAKER_03]: arrested right now, like have our were
were they've had to deal with laws where
[SPEAKER_03]: only no more than four indigenous people
could gather together.
[SPEAKER_03]: What these native elders have lived
through laws where they could not gather.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're talking about you can't be more
than four native people at once or you're
[SPEAKER_03]: against the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: What has and also residential schools,
you know, where they're taken out of their
[SPEAKER_03]: lands, and to made speak English and to
disconnect them from the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the people getting arrested
today and yesterday for protecting the
[SPEAKER_03]: last remaining old growth in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should welcome Colin and Craig from
Alpenglow into the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just showed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing really well, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for thanks for having us and thanks
for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh, it's always important to,
you know, voice as much as we can to all
[SPEAKER_04]: communities so they can you know,
join and be a larger voice together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see you, Craig.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always a big fan of your work out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being on with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Josh, for rolling that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been following along in the stories
and doing a small share of reposting and
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to bring some awareness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is so real and it happens here in
our our community as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of you that have driven the 101
through the Humboldt Mendoz state line,
[SPEAKER_09]: like we're battling Caltrans there because
they want to widen the road so trucks
[SPEAKER_09]: could go bigger trucks and could travel
through there and faster.
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now it's like we call it the
redwood curtain because they have to a
[SPEAKER_09]: certain length of semi needs to unhook and
get put on by a little tractor semi to
[SPEAKER_09]: pull it through there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also slows everyone down to 40
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like it's almost like going to
church for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we go 65 forever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's like just slow down and
appreciate what we have.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Josh, you brought up a lot of
valid points.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you're seeing I live in a wooden
house and these fur beams in my house came
[SPEAKER_09]: from my land and I cut those down.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our land personally was pretty
hammered by the loggers and grew up all at
[SPEAKER_09]: one time.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple seed trees left here or
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are taking the chainsaws out and
doing a bunch of management because what's
[SPEAKER_09]: grown back has grown back as Mother Nature
didn't really plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in time, it would correct itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's choking out some of the smaller
species and are falling.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have this dead and dying thing
happening and bringing back the carbon
[SPEAKER_09]: sequestered carbon back into its own
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the fire danger we have right
now, we can't wait for Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have to step in and do some of
our own management practices just in our
[SPEAKER_09]: little footprint here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are doing we're chipping it and
we're we're using that to build soil and
[SPEAKER_09]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think those of you that are
listening that are hearing the talk about
[SPEAKER_09]: trees, I think you really have to have
critical thinking and I so much of that
[SPEAKER_09]: critical thinking has gone out the window
these days.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's with Corona and all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks have just thrown the critical
thinking out and it's it's platforms like
[SPEAKER_09]: this that help us bring these minds
together and and share our thoughts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Marcus, time and time again
for holding space for all this community
[SPEAKER_09]: and everyone here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate you for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate the kind words.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice to start it off with some
realness this morning, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: like I personally absolutely love visiting
old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have cedar forest, a standing cedar
forest that's just up the road,
[SPEAKER_12]: just up past Whistler.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have an ancient cedar forest and
they're pretty big trees, 20 to 25 feet in
[SPEAKER_12]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're impressive.
[SPEAKER_12]: They take your breath away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, Tofino, Mears Island,
some really beautiful trees out that way
[SPEAKER_12]: as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just such a shame to to to see
them be cut down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even for people that were here,
you know, back in the day when logging was
[SPEAKER_12]: happening in the fifties and the sixties,
it was really just one tree that would hit
[SPEAKER_12]: the that would hit the truck at a time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you see these logging trucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, like one tree for multiple trucks
even.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice little treats, Sharon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I hope Brian shows up from best
friend farms because he's been doing these
[SPEAKER_12]: incredible like cookies and like donuts
and like just kind of like they look
[SPEAKER_12]: really like a treat that you would eat.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I meant to mention it last week,
but we got sucked so far down the rabbit
[SPEAKER_12]: hole of sensory science that by the time I
went to go see if he was in the room,
[SPEAKER_12]: he had bounced.
[SPEAKER_12]: He had some problems with his with his
Internet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully he comes back in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm about to puff a little dab of some 120
micron strawberry banana shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is definitely what dreams are made of
right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me tell you, if this right here,
this is literally how we could stop these
[SPEAKER_12]: motherfuckers from cutting down trees,
because I'm telling you, a couple of
[SPEAKER_12]: heroic dabs of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's just no way that those people
are going to decide that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: this is in my best interest.
[SPEAKER_12]: And wow, as humans, we get caught up like
you could you could just feel the
[SPEAKER_12]: polarity, the tension between a logger and
an activist.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can you can just the way we just have
these different mentalities.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't help but feel that the
compelling of speech is getting us into a
[SPEAKER_12]: very dangerous position here in life as we
start to compel speech.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are certain things we can talk about
and there are certain things we cannot
[SPEAKER_12]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we talk about those things,
we will ostracized, we will be ridiculed
[SPEAKER_12]: and we will be punished.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not necessarily talking about any
one particular thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, you know, for a long time,
this Jordan Peterson guy was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: listen, this isn't about these issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about compelling speech and
controlling speech.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are now getting into a level of
compelling of compelled speech that maybe
[SPEAKER_12]: we've never seen before in the history of
our species.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope one day that it doesn't become,
you know, insane to talk about saving
[SPEAKER_12]: trees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope one day that they don't decide to
ostracize us and make us look like
[SPEAKER_12]: conspiracy freaks because we think that
trees produce oxygen and that we want some
[SPEAKER_12]: of them to be alive because I see a lot of
things getting cast into that sort of
[SPEAKER_12]: well, we can just disregard that because
we have this argument against that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, we've compelled speech.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're not really allowed to talk
about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, freaks me out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, I'm going to have a
little dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus, I, I kind of resemble that remark
that you just made about if we had a few
[SPEAKER_09]: more light depths of strawberry banana,
just planted one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys can see it up
there on my big flat.
[SPEAKER_09]: We planted it into native soils.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been starting to utilize this
technique of trenching with a trencher,
[SPEAKER_09]: making just a little cut because we have,
where we have clay and shale, it is so
[SPEAKER_09]: compacted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's ridiculous from some of these
logging sites.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've tried this technique where I'm
trenching down and then putting the wood
[SPEAKER_09]: chip and inoculated straw and building
soils that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then putting, putting a little bit of
locally sourced nursery stock soil just
[SPEAKER_09]: around the plant itself so it can go out
and give it itself a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, it's coming along nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I'm excited to see how this one
comes out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first time I've done it as a
light depth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done it as full term.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you have more time for those roots
to get established and tap into the
[SPEAKER_09]: biology.
[SPEAKER_09]: Light depth is an interesting one to do in
native soils.
[SPEAKER_09]: As some of you know, it takes just an
extra minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to be a little more patient,
but once it kicks in, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does your trench drain water or does it
hold water when you make it, Craig?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Josh, you've been here and down at our
Huckleberry flat place, the lower place
[SPEAKER_09]: that we actually sold, that was more of a
shale finger of the, of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there it actually functioned really
nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where we went a bit deeper and
we put a lot of wood chip in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_09]: that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be a sponge and capture the
water before it just drained down through
[SPEAKER_09]: the shale.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this one, I had a problem, even with a
trencher getting through the, a hard pan
[SPEAKER_09]: clay, like it was just like bouncing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this one, I really feel it's going to
hold water and we are being super.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the opposite now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of trying to create a sponge at
the bottom and hold water that was passing
[SPEAKER_09]: through, this one will be using just
minute water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a bunch of this wood chip that
we've recently made, we've put in the
[SPEAKER_09]: pathways and, and along the edges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually part of the technique is
prepping the flat, before we even operate
[SPEAKER_09]: the trencher.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes if we have the time,
we would put down a loose fill straw,
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of the Ruth Stout method.
[SPEAKER_09]: So loose fill straw and then two inches or
so of raw manure, let that sit over the
[SPEAKER_09]: winter, then trench.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're bringing the native over
it, like a lasagna layer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm not one for using
mechanized tools, but sometimes when
[SPEAKER_09]: you're on the mountain, you don't have a
choice and you bring them in one time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're good, but the tailings of
the trencher are really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really nice structure to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it, it, it makes it a really nice
lasagna layer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now up here, we didn't have the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did the, we did the straw wood chips
and then we let the chickens out on it for
[SPEAKER_09]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the chickens went through and got all
the hay seeds out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: inoculated with their, with their manure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we trench.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when we bring that native soil on
top, it keeps that clay tailing from
[SPEAKER_09]: becoming anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's also really important with the,
the manures as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we have that on top, and then we
will come through and probably put a
[SPEAKER_09]: really light layer of wood chip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I also picked up some spawn
blocks from Mushroom Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be inoculating that, the pathways
first.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then with a pathway being like that
thick with a wood chip, we will inoculate
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll come in with some compost
tea and just dump it and dump it and dump
[SPEAKER_09]: it and let that be the biology spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on there, you can spread that on your
aisles, you know, little seed of some
[SPEAKER_03]: biology from different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the year, your aisle is creating
the indigenous microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_03]: because when you use rice to create
indigenous microorganisms, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a lot of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the green molds that come on it
are heavy and trichoderma and no one's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually testing the species on the rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you use more locally sourced raw
materials to build your indigenous
[SPEAKER_03]: microorganisms, then you're going to get
more diverse biology from your region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because rice doesn't grow in your region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how is biology going to have the
intelligence to propagate itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Only certain things will propagate itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really by using wild grasses and leaves
and your indigenous soils coming up,
[SPEAKER_03]: manures, mushroom blocks, these are all
things that grow in their region and have
[SPEAKER_03]: a more complex carbohydrate, a more
complex carbon for biodiversity,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really love that, you know,
you're taking on the aisle tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a word, but maybe it is
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the aisles, there's so much
earth that can come from there for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love you, Melanie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your passion and,
you know, and your completion of your
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite an accomplishment and it feels
amazing to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing just to want to keep
going too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really neat to see what
the future holds for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to my husband for the
support.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, the two beautiful girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one thing that Melanie is going
to be going on and teaching is public
[SPEAKER_09]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of us realize what an important
tool that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we can have these regenerative
tools.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have these political views.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have this activism, but without
being able to speak and deliver it
[SPEAKER_09]: properly and accurately, we'd be lost.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I sure appreciate her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more so just
[SPEAKER_00]: to find what's inside of ourselves and be
able to express that authentically in our
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me expressing myself the way that
Melanie does is different than the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would or that Josh would.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just encouraging people to trust who
they are and trust that they can express
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in a way that is like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Original thought is lacking these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why it's important to turn off
your electronics every once in a while and
[SPEAKER_03]: go experience yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go experience your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go experience your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go touch your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go be in tune with intuition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because intuition and feelings,
it's learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a muscle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you have to teach
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people that are remote viewers or
people that are intuitives, they work on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's work on using our voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's work on our original thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's authentic to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to be part of a group,
too, because community is part of our
[SPEAKER_03]: importance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But bringing original thought to it is
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B's in the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Johnny B in the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say what Josh was just saying is
to spend time with the sublime.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the sublime is humbling.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you will all be a little bit,
the way I put it the other day to a
[SPEAKER_12]: friend, is you know what, we'll be a lot
less dicks if we're just, we'll be a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: nicer if we can just share time with this
humility.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is to stare the sublime in the
face.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go jump off a mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go snowboard down a mountain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go spend time in a garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go out in the middle of the ocean and feel
how insignificant you are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because yeah, it's okay to be humbled.
[SPEAKER_12]: The world could use more of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing hemp right now from Daryl
Hudson and in planta and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the Vavilove.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does everyone know who Nikolai Vavilove
is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, in the 1920s, Nikolai Vavilove
traveled the world collecting cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and also other seeds and created the
Vavilove Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he was one of the foremost genetic
seed collectors of the world at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over the course of the years,
he became ostracized by the community and
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually jailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually starved to death in
jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the Vavilove Institute still exists
and has lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you know, that combined with the
historical hemp of China, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp in a different way right now because
yeah, high CBD is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an obvious medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But food and fiber coming out of hemp is
gonna be what saves us from the forest
[SPEAKER_03]: industry or potentially Bill Gates,
you know, whole meat thing or whatever to
[SPEAKER_03]: save the earth and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these seeds are the largest seeds
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they grow up to 18 feet tall and have
giant stalks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can outproduce the forest
industry and cellulose and fiber by I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know the number four to five times,
you know, that way outproduced timber
[SPEAKER_03]: sales when it comes to biomass and when it
comes to say, pellet fuel or kept creates
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are putting our best foot forward to
continue these genetics outside of CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of medicinal and continuing the
work of food and fiber hemp, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is part of what makes
cannabis the master plant that it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't become a master plant
in evolution without having, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this plan offers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel really blessed right now to be
able to stand in the presence of thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of years and hundreds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think every cannabis plant is a thousand
year old, you know, multi-generational
[SPEAKER_03]: creation, whether it's a hybrid or from an
ancient stock, but being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: reinvigorate that ancient stock is pretty
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna go grab the seeds real quick
so you can see the size of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did do a post of them and some people
saw them, but.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what that plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like Sam showed me the biggest and
the smallest seeds I've ever seen in my
[SPEAKER_12]: life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he did it like all within the same,
like 30 seconds span of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the smallest ones, I got from Casimir
and the biggest ones from Yunnan,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I did work with Valois for five,
six years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had access to every seed they had.
[SPEAKER_12]: But did they have access to every seed you
had?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have access to seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, let me get this in my hand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are these the walnut seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I get a scale?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest I've ever had were 12 to one
gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that Sam has a reference point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just think of that for one second,
okay?
[SPEAKER_12]: He's going to weigh these monster seeds
and Sam says to him, oh, the biggest ones
[SPEAKER_12]: I ever had were 12 to one gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who fucking knows that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much my seeds weigh
particularly, but I know how many fit on a
[SPEAKER_09]: teaspoon of my legacy genetic.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know I can take a teaspoon and that's
about 100.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like a lid.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an Alpenglow lid.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: A spoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait to see how much these seeds
weigh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see how many he gets.
[SPEAKER_12]: In a gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: The ones Sam put in my hand literally were
like small walnuts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember laughing when I first saw them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those were not the most insane seeds
Sam ever put in my hand because the most
[SPEAKER_12]: insane seeds he ever put in my hand were
like from some burial from like 2000 plus
[SPEAKER_12]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was like, check these out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was kind of like, what are these?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they look really old.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the 110th anniversary of the
Valvolap Institute.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: How old were those seeds that you had from
like the burial?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, those are I think 1700 years old,
almost 2000 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those seeds were the seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the only cannabis thing I ever
held in my hand that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hair stood up on the back of my neck
when I realized what they were.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, you know, Sam just throws
them at me like they're nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Valvolap Institute folks took me over
to the Hermitage Museum where the seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: were from the, it was from the Roshinko
burial tomb where Roshinko is the one who
[SPEAKER_06]: dug it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they found these, you know,
1700, 2000 year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they gave me eight of them that they
found in a little leather pouch buried
[SPEAKER_06]: under the ground with all kinds of other
cool treasures from the Scythians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try and germinate them,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got them growing right now in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were completely dried out and,
you know, there was no oil in them at all
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were beneath though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they were okay when they dug them up
because it was, the whole tomb was buried
[SPEAKER_06]: in ice for all this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what happened was they started the
museum for 20, 30 years before they gave
[SPEAKER_06]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were almost 2000 years old,
so.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see these seeds, Josh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you weighing those seeds over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we just realized Josh still lives
in a day of paranoia and his scale is out
[SPEAKER_09]: in an olive barrel, like in the back 40.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to go dig it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be back within the hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triple beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: If these hills could talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Mark, what's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the test go with the, I believe
you were telling me you had THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or CBDV.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what novel cannabinoid
you got a new line on that you're trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: What company was that and what
cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it was a company that was selling
THCV isolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the company is called Snapdragons.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're at a CBD and they're out of
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were on the Adam Dunn show and
Adam or Adam's guy called me up and had me
[SPEAKER_08]: come on the show real quickly a couple of
Fridays ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just happened to be on and
they're like, Hey, we got THCV isolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Ooh, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: See what that's like.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I ordered some.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it, it, it, it is pretty pure,
but it's totally Delta eight configured,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, it's not Delta nine THCV it's,
it's Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it makes me think that they're just
converting it from, from CBDV.
[SPEAKER_08]: So CBDV like CBD makes an isolate and you
could convert that isolate over to the THC
[SPEAKER_08]: form.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you start with CBDV make THCV.
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously, yeah, this is like what
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out in the marketplace now.
[SPEAKER_08]: People have a lot of access to like large
amounts of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe not a large amounts Marcus,
but they're able to make isolate from,
[SPEAKER_08]: from distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, I mean, where else does it come
from?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the other thing is that I don't
know if you guys are on future 4,200,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's this fella.
[SPEAKER_08]: I entrap there who's actually testing a
lot of Delta eight products and finding a
[SPEAKER_08]: whole soup of really nasty chemicals in
there, not only the starting materials and
[SPEAKER_08]: what happens when they, so what they do is
they, they take CBD and they treat it with
[SPEAKER_08]: acid and that converts it over to THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it also unzips the molecule.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and rips the, the terpene portion of
CBD off the ring and makes this compound
[SPEAKER_08]: called a Livotal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll know a Livotalic acid is the
precursor to all the cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a Livotal is not something that you
want to be consuming.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and so this guy is out buying samples
of,
[SPEAKER_08]: if they're less pure, you'd think that,
you know, they would just throw that away.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they end up in things like gummies
where, you know, yeah, the consumer is
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be tasting the gummy,
but they're not knowing that the crap
[SPEAKER_08]: that's in there is only like about 50 or
60% pure, meaning that there's 40% other
[SPEAKER_08]: crap in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's finding things like phthalates in
one sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually found dioxins and dioxins is a
really toxic class of molecules.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to make dioxins, my gosh, they must
have just a toxic soup of, of stuff in
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these folks are just hemp processors.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not, they're not chemists like me.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't understand that what they're
making is they're making a chemical
[SPEAKER_08]: mixture and then thinking that it's okay
to put into and safe to put in the
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's clearly not their focus.
[SPEAKER_12]: Their focus is to find an exploit in the
system and to be able to make money where
[SPEAKER_12]: they thought they previously couldn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been the, it's been the name of
the game since the beginning of hemp being
[SPEAKER_08]: grown in the U S because it could be done
clean and pure that there's ways that of
[SPEAKER_12]: course, of course, but that's not your,
when that's not your focus, when your
[SPEAKER_12]: focus is just to find the exploit to make
money, these are the repercussions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see that they banned it in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the reasons why they
banned it in Colorado is because the Delta
[SPEAKER_08]: nine lobby is so strong in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly the Colorado is one of the
leading States of, you know, regulating
[SPEAKER_08]: the industry here in the U S but I guess
the real disappointing thing is that like,
[SPEAKER_08]: when you go to these Delta eight markets,
they're in all the cannabis unfriendly
[SPEAKER_08]: States like Mississippi and Tennessee and
Alabama.
[SPEAKER_08]: And none of those States have cannabis
programs because they sell Delta eight
[SPEAKER_08]: cartridges down at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why do they need cannabis?
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Marcus, when you look at the
guy who's on future 4,200, if the watchers
[SPEAKER_08]: or the hash church people need to know
there's a guy named iron trap.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the guy you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's a couple of threads in there that
talks about him analyzing commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's actually looking for producers to
say, Hey, if you guys think you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: clean product, send it to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll test it for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell you what's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess some people, again,
that's where the interaction goes bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll tell them you got all this crap in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You better change.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're just like, fuck you,
you know, and that's where it ends.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so listen, you should invite him on to
hash church.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you get a chance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, the way 40 200 works,
no one really knows who the guy is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I can tell you, come on, like Sam
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He, he, he's kind of like Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sam, you probably know this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says he's been working in phone number
and address.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he's been working in cannabinoid
science for 30 or 40 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you look at the content of his
posts, you realize this guy is,
[SPEAKER_08]: is no joke, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Colin, he is no joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of haters on 40 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a very interesting forum,
but, um, science is like the art community
[SPEAKER_04]: though.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of haters, you know,
but the weight of unknown, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's called future 40 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a website and you can go there and
look and just look at, like, I think the
[SPEAKER_08]: thread that I'm thinking of is something
like there's a safe compliant way to make
[SPEAKER_08]: Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think most of this chatter happened
back in March.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, there was a lot of edicts
that came out about Delta eight,
[SPEAKER_08]: including this ban in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows if again, him going out and
testing some of these products that are in
[SPEAKER_08]: this unregulated marketplace help the FDA
and DEA actually sort it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what are we going to do here?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I think very clearly it
seems like there's like about more than
[SPEAKER_08]: what two dozen states not that have banned
Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of my next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, all right, so because of this
chemistry and this toxicologist that's
[SPEAKER_04]: really, you know, looking into this,
the, you know, do you believe that's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of, uh, you know, the reasoning behind
the, the, the regulation of Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you believe that this is going to
continue?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you believe it should continue
more?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he's, he's really getting down on,
on producers that don't have in-house
[SPEAKER_08]: analytics to basically put some type of
quality control mechanism on what they're
making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hammer.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could use a hammer to knock in a
little pack, or you could use a big
[SPEAKER_08]: fricking sledgehammer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think a lot of these people are using
a big fricking sledgehammer and they're
[SPEAKER_08]: busting the molecule apart back into a
livitol and some other degradation
[SPEAKER_08]: species.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think parasymin comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a few other things,
but it's interesting because again,
[SPEAKER_08]: he's just looking for stuff that's in the
marketplace and, and all the producers are
[SPEAKER_08]: like scared of this guy because he's got
the sophistication and the analytical
[SPEAKER_08]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sam, I bet you a dollar to a donut
that you know who this dude is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's totally anonymous in this forum,
but, um, he's been in cannabinoid science
[SPEAKER_08]: for a real long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you that everything that he
posts, I read it almost, it took me about
[SPEAKER_08]: two days worth of reading just to get
through March 21st of that single post.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anybody who sends me 9.95,
nine euros and 95 cents, I'll send you his
[SPEAKER_06]: address, his phone number, social security
number, his bank account number.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the other thing that made him quite
unpopular is he said that he's putting a
[SPEAKER_08]: binder together and you're going to send
it to the DEA and the feds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that just instant hot
button, you know, the lot of people,
[SPEAKER_08]: this guy's a douche.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a snitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he could find things that are wrong
with the substances being sold to
[SPEAKER_06]: consumers, a whistle needs to be blown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's, he's the guy that's doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he says he's doing it because a his
friends are being poisoned.
[SPEAKER_08]: People like, yeah, he knows are being
bringing things to him and saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, can you look at this?
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks at it and says, there's poison in
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing is he claims that
there's a safe and efficient process to
[SPEAKER_08]: make this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you need internal analytics to,
to tell the quality of your products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, Marcus, I ask you all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus will show a nice piece of hash like
that hash meteor he showed last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll say, Hey, what's the,
what's the cannabinoid numbers on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you know what it is you're making?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can't test what it is you're
making.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it calls for in-house
analytics, but it also calls for a higher
[SPEAKER_08]: level of competency than just a bunch of
cowboys down South making this stuff in
[SPEAKER_08]: their fricking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also too, Mark, to be honest, I think one
of the main impetus behind banning it in
[SPEAKER_06]: many States is the fact that it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, what fucking, what textbook did
you read?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go read Paul Malberg, go read the people
who actually figured out cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_08]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It ends at Delta eight THC.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't go to Delta eight, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people
on record who say that Delta eight is,
[SPEAKER_08]: is found in trace amounts in the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I laugh at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I wanted to cut to Josh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to cut to Josh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I saw he, he had 13 seeds to a gram,
but then he went off camera and he found
[SPEAKER_12]: some bigger ones and came back as a 12 per
gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those from Yunnan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, it's a combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination of the Babylon and the
Chinese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is from, you know, which has
the most biodiesel, the most biodiversity
[SPEAKER_03]: in all of China.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been everywhere around the world
looking at Canada seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm with the biggest I found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: 102.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd have to ask about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you'd have to ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now my small seeds were 800 plus to the
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that tropical?
[SPEAKER_05]: I collected it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, those seeds, I think are the answer
to saving the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe, you know, so that's what I'm
excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's for saving the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big ones are the small ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm saying is the big ones are
because in this case, and maybe the small
[SPEAKER_03]: ones make giant trees too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that these particular seeds
are very large and they also produce some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the largest hemp plants ever,
you know, that you'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not a big flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fiber and food seed thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe that's going to be saving the
forest industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when you walk in an old growth
forest, you're walking on four to five
[SPEAKER_03]: feet of trees that have been down for a
thousand years.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no manmade forest that'll ever,
ever make it to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially in a fire zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you wanted to create a nice
forest and a fire zone, you would have to
[SPEAKER_03]: cut the trees down, which I don't agree
with, but you'd have to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'd have to buck them up and then
you'd have to cut them, slice them in
[SPEAKER_03]: half, and then put them on the forest
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise you're just stealing soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when you walk in an old growth
forest, the purpose of the trees growing
[SPEAKER_03]: really close to themselves is so they
fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to speed up that process
and you have to fall them, put them on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground and not take them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise you'll never, there'll never be
another large forest there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only so much dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only so many needles that can
fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you walk in a thousand year old
forest, you're walking on four to five
[SPEAKER_03]: feet of moss and humus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what makes us a humus being,
you know, we're humus being.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're humus beings when we're from the
earth, when we believe in natural
[SPEAKER_03]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes us carbon based
microbial humus beings.
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes that really happen,
Josh?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fungi, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the wood decay fungi that decay.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's stuff called white rot and brown
rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it hits white rot, it leaves
brown behind and when it hits brown rot,
[SPEAKER_08]: it leaves the white behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, those fungi have figured out
ways to completely mineralize the content
[SPEAKER_08]: of the rotten wood.
[SPEAKER_08]: It starts with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bacteria lead the way, but then fungi come
in after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all those rotten trees that you find
are, yeah, just the tops of what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: That layer of humus that goes back for
centuries of fallen wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fungi is here to save humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I go to Oregon, Washington or
California, it's very difficult to find
[SPEAKER_03]: polypores.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to find polypores
because there's no trees rotting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's managed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no branch to rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've robbed the forest of fungi and
you've robbed the humanity of the fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazingly so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes those dead and dying forests,
those nasty fire forests are what saves
[SPEAKER_03]: our life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be that they want to cut down the
old growth forest because when someone
[SPEAKER_03]: walks into an old growth forest,
their life is changed forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, oh my God, what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, the resonance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, owls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey ravens, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen life like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're losing the diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very important that we put
branches on the ground and let them rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes greenery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes greenery.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the branches away, you lose the
greenery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen forests green in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way it's possible is mulch love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to over mulch the system and
that's three branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's mulch love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Josh.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing I want to add to what he was
talking about, when we're cutting our
[SPEAKER_09]: firewood for the season, we'll leave
behind a little stack as an offering back
[SPEAKER_09]: along the roadways or along wherever in
the forest we were cutting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then now when we do our walks back
through the forest, that's busting turkey
[SPEAKER_09]: tails and all sorts of mushrooms on either
end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And lizards are coming out of the middle
and we'll sometimes roll it back as just a
[SPEAKER_09]: little view into the earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you see all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was talking earlier about selling
off part of our farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we sold this amazing, amazing humus
beings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was walking the road and he said,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, leave one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you stack the next ones on it,
you can keep that cycle going and then
[SPEAKER_09]: harvest some for hoogle beds or whatever
you might do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just know what you're saying,
Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, another really good idea is like,
if a person lives near forests,
[SPEAKER_03]: the unbelievable amount of slash that they
burn in the clear cuts is it's mind
[SPEAKER_03]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much material left over,
so much raw material left over by the
[SPEAKER_03]: loggers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all they're going to do is put it in
the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, like if you have a truck and a
trailer, like an incredible amount of raw
[SPEAKER_03]: materials can be gathered out of clear
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should do it because you're not
stealing future soil from the clear cut,
[SPEAKER_03]: because all they're going to do is stack
it up and burn it, which is just mind
[SPEAKER_03]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they try and replant a forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's so frustrating, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you know, like you said,
Craig, there's this balance, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we're taking some, we're leaving
some, but the mindset of I think we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to read wild environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to rewild our cannabis
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to rewild our genealogy to
have viruses because without viruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: our immune system cannot evolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: By stopping ourselves from getting sick,
we're stopping our body, another muscle,
[SPEAKER_03]: the immune system from working properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh, before we do any of this,
to be honest, we need to lower the world
[SPEAKER_06]: population because the world cannot
support the amount of people we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had one tenth of the amount of
people we have, maybe the world could be
[SPEAKER_06]: okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a sustainable way, we got too many
and it's only going to be more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we live in a scarcity environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, based off the style of life that
we live as 8 billion people on the planet,
[SPEAKER_03]: based off that style, based off what's
been handed to us, we live in scarcity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can live in abundance if everyone
participated in the concept that we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to better ourselves and make more
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: If everyone grew a little bit in their
yard, on their roof, on their terrace,
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere, something, it's possible for us
to live in abundance even with 8 billion
[SPEAKER_03]: people on the earth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we have an abundance of scarcity and
it is driving the market, literally.
[SPEAKER_09]: They make us feel a shortage and then it
just drives and drives and drives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without regenerative agriculture and
regenerative soils, you can talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: soil science all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about sensory stuff,
but 95% of the beers out there are coated
[SPEAKER_03]: in glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most of the wine is so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got all the sensory down,
but the base of the sensory is tarnished.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's toxic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really like the first thing is how do
we put health back into the system?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we put health back in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can talk about sensory.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're analyzing sensory while we're
getting poisoned by glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_03]: then it's just not a system that's
recognizable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a broken system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I constantly will continuously promote
regenerative lifestyle and soils and
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative style cultivation and
polyculture and permaculture because I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be one of those people that
survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear from Max Monrose about the
other type of terpenes he discovered?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the other trichomes, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I only sent my message late last night,
so I didn't hear back from him.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, he did say that he was going to
come back and share that with us as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was something else, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said he grafted hops and cannabis
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he didn't graft it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He bred it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He crossed it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was quite skeptical, but if somebody did
it, I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you're the doubting Thomas,
and that's why you got to touch the
[SPEAKER_12]: incorporeal body of Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm very interested also if he
thinks he has a different kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very interested.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there have been quite a few posts,
and even Ed Rosenthal picked up on this
[SPEAKER_12]: recently.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a guy who posts, and I don't know
if they're just mutants, but he posted a
[SPEAKER_12]: picture of a trichome the other day that
had six little heads on top of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could remember his name because
he's posting all sorts of very,
[SPEAKER_12]: very high level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that in a variety?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just know that it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be a one of, it could be a
mutant, it could be a variety.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't know enough about it,
but it's definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could find one to share,
but the only one person I know really is
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed that posted it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoever's running his account post.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is it right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like opium poppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it up and say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it up and say something so your
screen is, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So six heads, although those heads,
all six of them look smaller than the head
[SPEAKER_12]: that would normally be on a stock of that
size.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice anthocyanin, sort of coursing through
the center there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me shout this guy out.
[SPEAKER_12]: His name is Zoom underscore gardens.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go check him out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll punch it into the chat too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's zooms underscore gardens.
[SPEAKER_12]: Doing some great work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to see best friend in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of love to you out in Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got to take off family and get some
stuff done preparing for the rain that's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming this week and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Joshua, Craig, Ray and Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin, Mark, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many blessings to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming in brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep growing those seeds bigger and
bigger, Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see, or wait, that's Josh with
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been watering all morning,
so I thought I'd just pop on and I always
[SPEAKER_15]: think I can hop on with a joint and a
coffee and water and talk.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is just not possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to talk with people here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I finally finished my watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow my Instagram at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw how
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I lost the whole top 12, six to 12
inches and had a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_15]: Big mistake.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just so impressed with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Big thanks to Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used a lot of the lush roots and the
Gaia green to kind of help push through
[SPEAKER_15]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just really impressed,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at these tops.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have a beautiful yield.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at all these tops.
[SPEAKER_15]: I messed up my depth this morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was I just put this depth on a couple of
weeks ago and I was kind of working on
[SPEAKER_15]: timing it and I broke my sheer pin,
so I got to run to the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_15]: You get a new sheer pin, so that's why
I've got my depth on half of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is one I selected out of 800 this
summer.
[SPEAKER_15]: The Blackwap Gold.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at these tops.
[SPEAKER_15]: My little fuck up is going to give me a
nice yield.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_12]: That plant looks like straight up like a
fucking canopy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at this big one back here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you see that big girl?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll walk over on one of these planks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I see her back there in the shade.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, in the shade, this big black vine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm this is six feet right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's seven, eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just started flower about three days
ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's going to get way up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You use light meters to figure out what
kind of light your plants are getting
[SPEAKER_12]: there, because Johnny B came over here the
other day with this like utterly
[SPEAKER_12]: ridiculous multi thousand dollar light
meter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe he can tell us a little bit about
that later.
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you use anything like that,
Josh?
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't afford one, but kind of the way in
the greenhouse is we build the light
[SPEAKER_15]: system to be a supplement, not to be a
full on.
[SPEAKER_15]: His lights on, there's a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm only putting in about 20 percent of
what the plants need.
[SPEAKER_15]: Twenty, thirty percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I had the depth on, I wouldn't be able
to grow a good crop with just these
[SPEAKER_15]: lights.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you in D.C.?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just below.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm on the border in Blaine,
Birch Bay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, maybe I can meet you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could just pass the meter across.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, toss it over.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting on the corner and you can pick it
up and leave the next day.
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's the Congo, though, from up
there, the Roberts Creek.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing the shade and I'm looking at I've
been doing this around my own yard by
[SPEAKER_14]: putting plants and solo cups at different
parts of different spectrums underneath
[SPEAKER_14]: the different trees and looking at
different reds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: With this right now, just the head in two
minutes before 20 cave redo.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have a four twenty cooperate beside
me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm kind of like, but we'll just keep
going here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was just on the light kick.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm putting on this depth and I built
this greenhouse oriented east to west,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Not north to south, because, you know,
my my version of regenerative is that I
[SPEAKER_15]: grow year round and I only support people
within 100 miles of me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that that's kind of how I I've
quantified this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I built this whole system to be a year
round greenhouse and to produce in the
[SPEAKER_15]: cold part of the year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had another another local flower guy
come over and he's like, what's up with
[SPEAKER_15]: that big tube?
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can look up here, I have a big I
call it the light, the dawn of life.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a big 36 inch tube that just
distributes the air from the top of the
[SPEAKER_15]: greenhouse into the whole system.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I and I just like, no,
man, I'm not it's never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been running this dog for five years
and I start talking to him real
[SPEAKER_15]: confidently about the understory and where
plant cannabis is in succession and how
[SPEAKER_15]: it's kind of an understory plant and the
diffusion.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I start talking about rattling all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to describe it better,
I have two layers of poly here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you blow them up, it creates a
light diffusion and it reduces the
[SPEAKER_15]: brightness in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it also spreads it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see it on the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go, you know, if I walk from one
greenhouse with double layer poly into
[SPEAKER_15]: another one with a single layer poly,
you can totally go in and then outside,
[SPEAKER_15]: you can totally see the sharp light.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see how it affects the foliage.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've also kind of fucked around with
putting some plants in the edge of my
[SPEAKER_15]: forest and kind of watched in stages and
watched the ones that maybe were a little
[SPEAKER_15]: bit farther back, how they did.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm fully convinced that the plants do
like a little bit less light, a little bit
[SPEAKER_15]: more diffused light.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then I got this depth on here and it's
create some serious shadows.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so now I'm like, oh man, what have I
done?
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of just say a lot just to bring up
the topic about lighting and diffusion.
[SPEAKER_15]: And since you were talking about it,
I don't know what anybody else has dug in
[SPEAKER_15]: there and working in the diffused and less
bright world.
[SPEAKER_15]: And indoors, it's a much different idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're kind of just trying to hit a
specific target and maintain that for an
[SPEAKER_15]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had some, I had some results with
some indoor back of the room changes with
[SPEAKER_10]: a strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: My gas mask, excuse me, actually seemed to
have done better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of even mossier, stinkier,
even a little bigger on the flowers in the
[SPEAKER_05]: back end of the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the light depths even being able to
drop the tarp.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a hot time during planting,
you can drop down half way and kind of use
[SPEAKER_10]: it for your own like shade, transitional
shading at the peak heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's because it's been kind of hot in
Maine even the last week over 80.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll ask the the farmers here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys think or suspect that there's
anything to do with climate change that
[SPEAKER_13]: has impacted the atmosphere which has
caused lighting to be different for us
[SPEAKER_13]: growing cannabis now in this time period
versus what the cannabis plant might have
[SPEAKER_13]: been typically used to working with on
Earth prior to humanity doing what we've
[SPEAKER_13]: done up until this point?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, quickly, the first thing that came
on my head was the fires.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two weeks in August with no sun,
when you're making flowers into September,
[SPEAKER_15]: that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a real crucial transition time and
the West Coast folks feel that pretty
[SPEAKER_15]: hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing I was thinking on the back
end was almost a positive effect.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look at it from a really humanistic
perspective, they were able to cultivate
[SPEAKER_15]: in places where we weren't able to
cultivate before.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really big interesting question on
my mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had the hard goal of it here on my
farm in large part with my neighbors and
[SPEAKER_15]: neighbor conflicts that have made it
really miserable.
[SPEAKER_15]: For many of times, I've been wanting to
give up and dreamt about moving away to
[SPEAKER_15]: another place and thought, where would I
do it?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I start kind of looking into what
the future looks like in different places.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, goddamn, I'm in one of the
best spots to really be going forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, just kind of the thoughts
that I have when I'm thinking about how
[SPEAKER_15]: these things are going to be in the future
and water is a big fear for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I'm in an abundant water
place, I think that the whole thing is
[SPEAKER_15]: going to be a real big issue going forward
with what companies are getting into
[SPEAKER_15]: charging and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I cut someone else off.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let whoever else was going to hop in.
[SPEAKER_10]: All good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just kind of agreeing with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm definitely seeing some changes and I'm
seeing hotter sun back into Maine here
[SPEAKER_10]: than I thought I would see coming from the
West Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got a big open up property here,
so I'm full spread of sun rise to sunset
[SPEAKER_10]: mostly here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But seeing bigger yields and the earth
seems drier this year here, really dry
[SPEAKER_10]: compared.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fire dry like the West Coast,
but it's kicking up dust.
[SPEAKER_10]: My ponds are dropping like a foot and a
half already and it's been a hot May.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the big things I've seen that's
kind of like driving the dogs nuts,
[SPEAKER_10]: driving us nuts are the bugs have kicked
up, the black flies, early mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, the dragonflies came in about a
month earlier because, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the change in climate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if that's just a two year
blip that we're seeing, but here as an
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor farmer in Maine, it's definitely
hotter, drier kind of drought conditions
[SPEAKER_10]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm seeing a kick up of bugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That seem to bring in the insect
environment pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they haven't been plaguing us,
but there's definitely waves of bugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gotten a bunch of the corn borers in
the last few years that seem to have come
[SPEAKER_10]: in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, anyway, that's what I'm
seeing some stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would lean in and offer this
thought to your question, Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the cannabis plant itself is
going to have any trouble with what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the environment because it's dealt with
all kinds of crazy shit and is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the effect on humans and the
cannabis industry, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity for folks to work with
this plant, create product and live a life
[SPEAKER_01]: that we all enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really different
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that Josh and Kelly with the
dragonfly earth medicine concepts around
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative practices certainly point to
one of many different things that we as
[SPEAKER_01]: humans are going to have to do in order to
preserve something like the life we
[SPEAKER_01]: currently enjoy going forward over the
next few generations of humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have grandchildren and I think this is
the real issue of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a fervent cannabis advocate for
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still am, but I really think what we're
doing to the environment that we live in,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we all share as humans is the real
question of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so circling all the way back to your
question, Max, yeah, I think it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a real issue going forward,
not just for cannabis, but for growing
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing food is going to be an issue
for us going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis plant will be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm concerned about the air quality too,
you know, for growing just to tag onto
[SPEAKER_15]: that food thought, you know, that the
quality of the air that we're going to
[SPEAKER_15]: produce, you know, to grow healthy food,
we're going to have to possibly grow in
[SPEAKER_15]: greenhouses, filter the air, and have
clean air, you know, places to grow our
[SPEAKER_15]: healthy food and our medicines is a fear
that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just throw one last thing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some of the farmers that are
in this group here, as well as listening
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Hash Church broadcast, may have
come to recognize that it's actually more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a challenge to grow food than it is to
grow cannabis, especially if you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been my experience at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just talk about germinating seeds of food
crops as compared to germinating cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Celery and other seeds take two years to
produce a crop of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's you know, it's more work for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, here's one, another one I got
from Russia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's master breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are known all over the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Master breeder.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what everyone calls themselves at
LPs now.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've turned that into a bad,
a bad word.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, master growers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes I think it should be master
baiters, but that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess here's another good question on
the lighting perspective for a room of
[SPEAKER_13]: intelligent growers is I've heard some
people say before that there are varieties
[SPEAKER_13]: that have spent so much time growing
indoors that they are indoor varieties,
[SPEAKER_13]: meaning transferring them outdoors,
they either don't do as well or can't
[SPEAKER_13]: handle the intensity of the outdoor
environment because they've more or less
[SPEAKER_13]: evolved over a 10 year period to be in the
environment of an indoor space.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys think there's any amount of
truth to that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think that there are some plants
that after spending too much time indoors
[SPEAKER_13]: has a change in the plant's life and cycle
that's noticeable when you were to put it
[SPEAKER_13]: outside?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not from a single year of selection,
but if you grew a big crop and selected
[SPEAKER_06]: the most leaning towards indoor
performance and you did that for 10
[SPEAKER_06]: generations in a row, then you would have
made one small step in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of see it, Craig.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I resonate with what Sam was saying
and I've witnessed it when I've been given
[SPEAKER_09]: some indoor seeds specifically from that
side of things and
[SPEAKER_09]: be more airy or more bushy than my liking
and the plants, cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_09]: specifically I feel is a really quick
learner.
[SPEAKER_09]: One season of breeding, the next year,
boom, the structure has changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can support itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what Sam was saying, we do that a
couple of years in a row and the
[SPEAKER_09]: phenotypic knowledge starts being passed
down and it learns so quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a really good thing to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I witnessed it probably five years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what the cultivar was,
but folks that would even tour my garden
[SPEAKER_09]: would go, what is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It smells amazing, but it didn't have the
structure to stand where it was in the
[SPEAKER_09]: garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: It needed to be inside and it took one
season to unlearn that or to learn the new
[SPEAKER_09]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, what is the new type of trichome?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have photos of the hop hybrid with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have photos of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't prepare them because I didn't
know that that's what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I could see if I could quickly
open a few files.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also don't know how much I should share
before my new book comes out.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the new trichome?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give it its name?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can tell you what I want to name
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently I have the opportunity to
name it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm not going to do is I'm not going
to name it after myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I thought would be appropriate from a
naming perspective, though, was something
[SPEAKER_13]: in alignment that Mushulam, where he came
up with anandamide, the Sanskrit word for
[SPEAKER_13]: bliss, which also has Hebrew translation
and iterations and has some biblical
[SPEAKER_13]: essence and nature in some senses.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am Jewish and I also study the esoteric
world.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Kabbalah, Torah, all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so with that thought process,
I asked, what would the seventh be or mean
[SPEAKER_13]: in a Hebrew word or essence?
[SPEAKER_13]: And in a meaningful way, because this
would be the seventh type of trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: found.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two types of non glandular
trichomes, unicellular and systolytic.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have bulbous simple and bulbous
complex.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have sessile and you have capitate
stocked.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's six.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this would be the seven.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this from a name perspective in
Hebrew, there's the name in Hebrew that
[SPEAKER_13]: means seven and seven from a miracle
perspective is Nessia.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this trichome is also capitate
stocked.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a very long stock and it has a
head.
[SPEAKER_13]: But instead of a mushroom shaped head,
it's an upside down teardrop shaped head.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of those trichomes, they're a
teardrop shaped head.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's got a really interesting roundness
to it with kind of like a point in a dew
[SPEAKER_13]: drop that comes off of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the stock itself is a third of
the width of a capitate stocked trichome.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are these really thin,
long stocks with these dew drop shaped
[SPEAKER_13]: heads off the end of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I would name it capitate stocked
Nessia, the seventh, the seventh trichome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, it's a miracle that no one else
has scientifically put a white paper on
[SPEAKER_13]: this yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Max, did you find it in all varieties
of cannabis or just particular lean
[SPEAKER_06]: towards a particular wide leaf,
skinny leaf, equatorial, northern?
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure of the origin of the
geography of the plants at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can confirm that I found them in both
hemp types and marijuana types.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can show you a picture if you want.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll find a picture of one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll show it to you right now since I'm
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing is, they are very, very,
very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just rarely see them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if you have Instagram and follow
these incredible artists that do
[SPEAKER_13]: incredible trichome photography,
you see hundreds, if not thousands of
[SPEAKER_13]: microscopic shots of trichomes on a weekly
or monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at least I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you look at these trichomes and
very, very up close, these images are just
[SPEAKER_13]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always hunting for these special
trichomes that pop up rarely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I do find one and then I have an
opportunity to acquire the flower and I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: able to really look at it myself,
you do find those other trichomes within
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's extremely exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then apart from that, I have found
multiple new types of trichomes,
[SPEAKER_13]: some of which are trichomes that are
non-glandular that are four to five times
[SPEAKER_13]: longer than most of the other trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So these very long curlicue trichomes that
are, they're just kind of outrageous.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I've also found trichomes where
the glandular head is in the center of the
[SPEAKER_13]: stock.
[SPEAKER_13]: So instead of the head being on the end of
the stock, there's a stock, then there's a
[SPEAKER_13]: glandular trichomes Max is finding are
actually novel trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like who's the judge over here when it
comes to this kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be a good question to ask.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you know the work of Paul Mulberg,
he's a scientist that has done cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid, and trichome research for the
United States federal government for over
[SPEAKER_13]: 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: And his younger lab techs and lab
assistants, one of which is,
[SPEAKER_13]: and so bringing them in a live plant with
these trichomes will give them the
[SPEAKER_13]: opportunity to dissect the trichomes
microscopically for their anatomy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you have to actually pull the
anatomy out of the trichomes and lay them
[SPEAKER_13]: these microscopic glands out almost like
you're doing a, it's not a biop.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you take apart a dead body.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love how like, whenever I'm like this
close to like looking like I know what I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: talking about, Mark always steps in and
he's like, let me help you out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well yeah, Max, we've talked about Paul
Mulberg before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I actually, Sam, don't you know
Dr. Kim?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I've met Dr. Kim.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Dr. Mulberg.
[SPEAKER_06]: I financed their lab for five years of
work with cannabis with Carl Hilling.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your comments are just right on the
center.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the wonderful research that he
did and the legacy that like through Dr.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kim and I'm sorry for cutting you off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we stand on the shoulders of giants,
including Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, where we are today and what
we can do with the plant and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_08]: science in general are really due to a
handful of individuals that walk the face
[SPEAKER_08]: of the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them who graces our panel today,
but others like Paul Mulberg and Raphael
[SPEAKER_08]: Mishum and Roger Adams and those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always think of those Brits who first
made distillate back in the 1890s and
[SPEAKER_08]: called it, yeah, no, this was way before
Adams.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was Easterfield, Spivey and Wood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wood, Spivey and Easterfield, the first
people to ice isolate THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, man, I mean, we stand on the
shoulders of all these people,
[SPEAKER_08]: Max, and it's just like when you read and
through open access, you could read most
[SPEAKER_08]: of Mulberg's research.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, there's a website that actually
has a list of all Paul Mulberg's papers
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's like 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just going to ask, Bubble Man,
if you can grace me with the ability to
[SPEAKER_13]: share my screen, I can show some of these
trichomes I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is showing your screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not my screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose photos are those?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Zoom Gardens and I'll share them
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_12]: He has the most incredible, insane mutant
macro photographs of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So while Max was talking about this,
I was going, I mean, that last one I just
[SPEAKER_12]: showed was like a trichome that literally
had stalk all inside the stalk,
[SPEAKER_12]: but there also trichomes growing off the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just figured it suited the
conversation, but I will figure out going
[SPEAKER_12]: in right now and gracing you with the
ability to share the screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why it sets it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So only the host can share, but you should
be good to go now, Max.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is in my book, Interpening.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you look on the upper right-hand
screen, this was the first time I actually
[SPEAKER_13]: ever saw the seventh trichome type was
when I was sifting through trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: photography from my buddy, Shweil.
[SPEAKER_13]: He used to live in Denver and I was
actually at his house just going through
[SPEAKER_13]: his pictures because I was going to
purchase some for my company, for our
[SPEAKER_13]: website and for stuff like my book.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it wasn't until after I actually
bought this photograph from him and I
[SPEAKER_13]: brought it home and I was looking at it
again and I saw the, it was really the
[SPEAKER_13]: stalk that stood out to me more than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can't see the, it's little unicorn
horn that kind of pulls off the end as
[SPEAKER_13]: well on this photo, but this was the first
image that I ever had of these.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have many more images of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we used to, we were the contract for
Dope magazine when we judged all of their
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis competitions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, my team of seven sifting
through hundreds of types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: microscopically at competitions for years
on end in multiple different states,
[SPEAKER_13]: we found one of these while we were
judging.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was cool to have a team of us guys
who know this stuff real well all be able
[SPEAKER_13]: to look through a microscope and turn a
flower around and continue to see this one
[SPEAKER_13]: rare trichome that very rarely sticks its
head out show up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we could all definitely see it with
our own eyes and verify that it was there,
[SPEAKER_13]: take pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this is genetically or
environmentally controlled?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any idea of why it has a
different shape?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the waxy cuticle emitted different or
you understand what I'm getting at?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the area that I need a lot of
help with, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm not a scientist at this level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it would be interesting Max,
if you could find a particular clone or
[SPEAKER_06]: variety where most of the trichomes were
this bulbous type or I forget the name you
[SPEAKER_06]: gave it, but I'll just call it,
not round, not oval, but tear shaped
[SPEAKER_06]: upside down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think to me, science is- That would show
it was genetically controlled.
[SPEAKER_13]: Science to me is a community effort.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my role in this has been to be the one
to observe it and spend five years trying
[SPEAKER_13]: to find it and getting my hands on the
genetic that consistently produces the
[SPEAKER_13]: trichome and then growing it out,
bringing that to a scientist, a team of
[SPEAKER_13]: scientists at a university, and then
letting them officially officiate the fact
[SPEAKER_13]: that this is a new novel trichome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then from there, when I have a genetic
and I've got the clones, I've got the
[SPEAKER_13]: mothers and I've got a white paper and
this is something novel and important,
[SPEAKER_13]: I would definitely be willing to give this
plant to someone who would be able to do
[SPEAKER_13]: the type of research that you were just
mentioning, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the head shape is important,
but it's the stem that is really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really unique, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and the cannabinoid content,
I mean, let's face it, if these things are
[SPEAKER_08]: being grown for cannabinoid content,
what is the impact on cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_08]: and yield from these?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when I see the more bulbous
trichome, I always think conventionally
[SPEAKER_08]: like, and from reading Malberg's work,
where they actually micro catheterized
[SPEAKER_08]: these things to actually suck the juice
out of these trichomes, I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: that the more bulbous the trichome,
the more oil that's there, the higher the
[SPEAKER_08]: yield would be, the more mature the
cannabis profile would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Mark, does it have a different
number of cells inside the resin head that
[SPEAKER_06]: are emitting the cannabinoids and
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm quite curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are we referring to the lower left-hand
side?
[SPEAKER_08]: The one where it just looks like it has a
head that's shriveled up?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Upper right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the upper right hand, the top side.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, in this photograph,
the trichome that's centered is the middle
[SPEAKER_13]: trichome, which is a beautiful image of
what I would consider a perfect capitate
[SPEAKER_13]: stock trichome if we were judging
trichomes further.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you go to the farthest trichome of
the very right, the stock of the teardrop.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see now.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Zoom speaker panel was covering that,
Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see it now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome to the party, Mark.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it comes to a point at the very end.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stem is a quarter the thickness of
the big fat stems of the other trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wouldn't you worry that that would make
these trichomes brittle and OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'd be a real drag if you tried to
make cash and the trichomes stems were
[SPEAKER_06]: brittle and that resin fell off really
easy when you wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Real bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what I was hearing,
and I've heard this now twice in like as
[SPEAKER_08]: many weeks, Sam, is that these high CBG
varieties, especially the white,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a variety called the white that's
a very high variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And CBG, it's it's grown here in North
America.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like anywhere between 13 to 18
percent CBG, hardly any THC at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said that's what they said.
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue with that is that harvesting and
getting the material to the lab is very,
[SPEAKER_08]: very crucial because the trichomes are so
brittle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a lot of loss in just handling
plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mark, this is some CBG right here
that I'm holding up if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some some sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What percentage CBG is for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's on the flower was, I think,
12 to 15 percent, depending on the batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the hash came in around or the
sift, I should say, coming came around
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, anywhere from 60 to 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 percent CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised it was green.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was waiting, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, Sam, this is a sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite nice, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the effects from CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting, very uplifting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the turf profile and those isolates
are pretty I mean, it's it's nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a good product, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just depends on what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for a more hempy
profile, then it's right up your alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for a drug cultivar,
really terpy, you know, it's not really
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know the background on the white,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came in from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those guys brought those those genetics in
from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it happen like two years over a
period of like two years, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had this variety over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, then the next thing I know,
those guys all formed LLCs in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the next year, I guess my question is,
where did the Swiss get it from the
[SPEAKER_06]: Italians and the Italians?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know where they got it from,
from the Ukrainians.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to add something in real quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: The picture he has up there now,
I have seen I have pictures of these for
[SPEAKER_12]: sure, Max, that I can go through and send
you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always thought it was a systolic hair
that because I'd seen trichomes break off
[SPEAKER_12]: and land on other components that weren't
necessarily growing there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So have I, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So have I seen what you've seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: But heads can fly around and be stuck on
things that didn't produce them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I always thought of this as like.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, it is such a like it's too
long of a hair.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too straight.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just too different.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have photos like this for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: From like 2008 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: But another head or it's sticking to a
stock, so therefore the head is sticking
[SPEAKER_13]: on the side of the stock.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm 100.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, you're talking to someone
who's who geeks out on trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, that's why peer-reviewed science is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you when you allow others to
examine it and try to poke holes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it stands, you've got it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want people to look into this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want university scientists to say I want
them to be the ones to say this is
[SPEAKER_13]: scientifically real and novel because I'm
the passionate, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: enthusiast, interpreter expert.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just the one who says I think this is
novel and I'll bring this to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that that's what I've but it's also
taken me five years to find the variety
[SPEAKER_13]: and confirm that it is what it is and then
get seed from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's it's it's been you could write a
novel on how crazy this has been.
[SPEAKER_13]: These trichomes here, you know,
there's.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also really interesting how mushroom
like trichomes appear.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's really interesting is the
fruiting body of LSD is also extremely
[SPEAKER_13]: phallic and mushroom like.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys have ever seen
the fruiting body of your fungus that
[SPEAKER_06]: produces clavitis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have that tattooed to my kneecap,
but it looks just so mushroomy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, you see this cluster of
mushroomy mushroom looking trichomes here
[SPEAKER_13]: and it appears like that almost maybe that
brittle factor where you said the trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: heads might have fallen off those two
trichomes right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's either this has a very tiny head with
a point coming out of it and the one
[SPEAKER_13]: behind it looks like its head fell off.
[SPEAKER_13]: But these are the trichomes that have a
stem that is a third the width of a
[SPEAKER_13]: typical capitate stocked trichome width.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see the capitate stock trichome
down to the lower right right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, this is that bizarre bulbous
shaped head, which is not your classic
[SPEAKER_13]: capitate stocked shaped head.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the rest of the trichome
continuing off from that head.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not a mutation, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also don't think that's a trichome
that broke off and fell somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do believe that between this
image and the other images that you have,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're seeing varieties of this type of
trichome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my first question, Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not an expert on plant trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know a couple though, but
[SPEAKER_08]: factor or some other anomaly that's
producing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's one variety that when I
found it had this trichome on it,
[SPEAKER_13]: we said, okay, it's this variety.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I secured some of that variety that
was grown in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_13]: I secured some that was grown in the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I secured some that was grown up North and
I'm growing it right now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so different environments in different
geographies are seemingly to produce the
[SPEAKER_13]: same trichome based off of the genetic
that it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I don't think it's an environmental
stress factor that's causing these
[SPEAKER_13]: trichomes to abruptly change their shape.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a type of cannabis plant
that is growing a new type of trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: that is a needle in a haystack.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I've been dedicated to
securing the genetic, growing it out,
[SPEAKER_13]: making a relationship with university
scientists to confirm that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to be clear, the cannabis that you're
finding these different trichomes,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not exclusively those that you're
finding those intermingled with regular
[SPEAKER_08]: looking trichomes and trichomes that we've
always seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are just sort of like a minor
type of trichome that you're finding the
[SPEAKER_08]: more you're looking at these close-up
images of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we know if they've been there all along
Sam?
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe Max's discovery here is just-
Anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I'd like to say is that if you
can find a variety where the majority of
[SPEAKER_06]: the trichomes are of this phenotype or
genotype, whatever they are, then it's
[SPEAKER_06]: probably genetically controlled.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can find one out of a thousand or
one out of a million and you can only find
[SPEAKER_06]: it on some plants and not other plants,
then yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the environment should be looked at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know if it could be
environmental.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's real, we want to know and we
want to track down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's genetically controlled,
you can create a variety that all of the
[SPEAKER_06]: resin heads are like that, or 99% of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you tried to breed with any of it and
make those observations?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know it's early and it would
take a ton of- What you need to do to sell
[SPEAKER_06]: it to find individuals that have more,
a higher incidence.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's some jar rot trichomes for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this was the white.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking for when you, one of you,
yeah, this is the white, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the white produces just the most
bizarre trichomes that there are.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are capitate starch trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are these the high CBG varieties,
Max?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they call the plant the white.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the white.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it the white.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a different kind of white than ripe
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: When they emanate fullness, when their
glandular heads are full of chemistry and
[SPEAKER_13]: they're at a ripening point, prior to
degradation, it's different.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that type of white is almost this
creamy white, this mother of pearl white.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what this high CBG variety produces is
trichomes that are glowing bright white.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's just say that there's like,
you know, in the paint store, there's a
[SPEAKER_13]: difference between like eggshell white and
bright white that is almost like a fence
[SPEAKER_13]: of it's blinding.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's a difference in
brightness.
[SPEAKER_13]: This high CBG grows these trichomes that
are glowing bright white.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of the glandular heads are white.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the stalks of the heads are white,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what makes this variety
striking.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really, it's striking.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so how does that work?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_13]: How come the why is the white producing
trichomes that are just this unique?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you stop the cannabinoid
biosynthetic pathway at not its endpoint,
[SPEAKER_08]: at its penultimate endpoint, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if the physiological
carrier
[SPEAKER_08]: and not making THCA or CBDA or the other
miners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the chemical profile on
these?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you rub this white resin from a fresh
plant that looks like that, and is it just
[SPEAKER_06]: as sticky as a normal THC high plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: From an aroma perspective?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, rub your fingers on the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it as sticky and oily as a THC plant?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So unfortunately, I have not had the
pleasure to grow this plant out myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can answer the question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Sam.
Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just trying to get to a reason
that makes logical sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_08]: I took one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a couple tops off of plants that a
farmer Amish farmer had down in Maryland
[SPEAKER_08]: down the road to get back to my lab,
did alcohol extraction and got like a 90
[SPEAKER_05]: pure CBG.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had about one or two percent THC,
so there's a lot of timing that needs to
[SPEAKER_08]: go into harvesting if you're harvesting
for CBG.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mark, maybe you can talk about this as
well, but this variety, the.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go to the grocery store and buy a
watermelon that is just natural and it
[SPEAKER_13]: comes packed full of seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you can buy a genetically
modified watermelon that is just seedless
[SPEAKER_13]: or grapes that are seedless or apples that
are seedless.
[SPEAKER_13]: This variety, I think if you go online and
possibly buy Oregon seed, you can buy this
[SPEAKER_13]: plant and grow a field of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you wanted to grow a field of it
again, I guess if you I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_13]: clone it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just found it really interesting
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The stuff in a variety of different ways
and every time I've come in contact with
[SPEAKER_13]: it, just to answer Sam's question from my
perspective, is the plant was
[SPEAKER_13]: extraordinarily dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_13]: It had no aroma profile whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It had no stickiness whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very dry texture and smell,
aroma experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it almost was disappointing,
like it didn't have a lot to offer other
[SPEAKER_13]: than the fact that it looked nutty with
its crazy white trichomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's pretty crazy to find a plant with
this much biomass with that amount of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabigerol that late in the flowering
cycle, because I'm pretty sure we all know
[SPEAKER_13]: that CBG is the mother cannabinoid that
starts building the others and that that
[SPEAKER_13]: process happens really early on in flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why you don't typically find a
lot of CBG when you harvest your plant at
[SPEAKER_13]: the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that this plant is being
harvested at the end of its cycle and the
[SPEAKER_13]: damn thing is packed full of CBG,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: But from us, like marijuana lovers,
it's not a ooey gooey sticky funky,
[SPEAKER_13]: skunky herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not at least what I came in
contact with.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was sifting through pounds of
this stuff, looking for a seed
[SPEAKER_13]: desperately.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just not even the remnants of a
seed, not even a hollow bract casing that
[SPEAKER_13]: would hold the seed, no seed whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a seedless variety from the
producers who produce it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I'm sure you can find this
variety that does produce seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying in the marketplace,
currently in the largest amount,
[SPEAKER_13]: this is a seedless variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Max, could you show us the
Pinkelberry photo?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you know who I got these from?
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, certified dank.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think I'm going to use one of
these in my new book.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can squeeze it in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is the one.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just posted this on the Trichome
Institute Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just always in awe when you see
style stigma that is just that striking.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just when you talk about weed porn,
that is just unreal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually growing the Pinkelberry by
coffee, Kai's coffee this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a collaboration those guys did.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're super excited to have it here in
Southern Humboldt and see how it looks and
[SPEAKER_09]: does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen Afghan plants that would produce
those colors of hairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: For D-Wiz, the first ones I saw was in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll never forget the first time I
photographed pink.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hairs under the macro.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just I mean, even just one or two
of them were so striking and so incredible
[SPEAKER_12]: that I remember giggling once I shot that
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Coyote Blue does that as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every once in a while, you can dry it,
cure it and revisit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can still see some of that color
that doesn't always happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very special, special thing when
you go revisit it and you see the color
[SPEAKER_09]: variations.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Craig, does that coffee that you're
working with, does it have a distinct and
[SPEAKER_13]: noticeable coffee aroma to it or is it
just called coffee?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was actually just texting with
Kaya himself just now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so it's out of Afghani stock that he
made and it definitely has a.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've only had it a couple of times,
so I'm going off memory, but it's almost
[SPEAKER_15]: reminiscent of Gorilla Glue, but
different, you know, where Gorilla Glue to
[SPEAKER_15]: me is more chocolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at Justin Calvino's place in
Mendocino and he was showing me this
[SPEAKER_13]: coffee and I was just doing backflips.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was over the moon excited because coffee
is my second favorite drug and I love
[SPEAKER_13]: coffee and cannabis together.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have mugs that have coffee and cannabis
together.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they just they just love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in cannabis is just.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, what other thing in the world
smells like blueberry or cat piss smells
[SPEAKER_13]: like skunk or like lemonade punch smells
like tangerines or dog shit smells exactly
[SPEAKER_13]: like coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this plant can mimic the identical
aroma profiles of beverages, food and
[SPEAKER_13]: fecal matter like like a pro.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just think that like coffee would
be like, oh, this guy is stoned and just
[SPEAKER_13]: imagines this.
[SPEAKER_13]: This smells like coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, no, smell it.
[SPEAKER_13]: This smells like coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: This cannabis plant smells like coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got so excited and Calvino was like,
yeah, I just rescued this one little clone
[SPEAKER_13]: and it like looked like sad and sickly on
the side.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's like, there's no more of this
anywhere left.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, this is the last of the coffee.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was terrified that we were going to lose
this like amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've always wanted to do a pairing at
a with a coffee cup first.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys know that like a
wine sommelier, sommelier, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: interpeneur, interpening, you know,
you're a beer Cicerone.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a cheese monger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you guys haven't seen the.
[SPEAKER_13]: The experts, which is actually shown in
California, where these crazy Californians
[SPEAKER_13]: are growing coffee as a vine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's called something like coffee
land to Mecca coffee land Mecca.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you look that up, you will see
these people that are just so enthralled
[SPEAKER_13]: with, with coffee, but I I'm sorry for
that rant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just got excited that you have this
variety, Craig.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would love to, I would love to do a,
do something with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to do a coffee parent with
coffee.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also do it with tea, with cigars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, cheese, just on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And only in Japan, are you considered a
tea master?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think China produces more tea and
some really fancy ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: From a product perspective, I'm sure China
does, but from a hospitality perspective,
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anybody serves tea the way
that a Japanese formal tea party is done.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's a pretty elaborate
ceremony, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to say good day to everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Temperature's getting hot and we've got
lots and lots of nursery stock out there
[SPEAKER_09]: that needs to be up potted and implanted
and cared for.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank everyone today for this
time and space.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck on the farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Never get the farmers for more than a
couple hours if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to work on plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some mycology projects today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to get to and a couple hundred
cacti I need to move.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, are you showing the hops cannabis or
are you saving that till next week?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for getting on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for getting onto that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to hear about that, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: My top three are hops or our beer,
coffee and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you're talking about coffee,
I light up and then I totally spaced on
[SPEAKER_05]: that, but I,
[SPEAKER_13]: okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys, you pull all my, uh,
all these secrets out of me because I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to like, you know, do the science
on these trichomes before other people do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying, I would never, you know,
go on something as big as hash church with
[SPEAKER_13]: as many.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got some of the world's experts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I appreciate when you guys,
uh, confirm that what I think I've
[SPEAKER_13]: discovered, um, might actually be,
uh, something worth, worth sharing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, these are all cannabis and hops,
uh, hybrids.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this, this is a vine that is
producing hop cones and the hop,
[SPEAKER_13]: right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the hop cone will grow downward kind
of like a little, uh, right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little hop.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a hop cone.
[SPEAKER_13]: These hop cones are covered in glandular
trichomes that are producing 17% THC,
[SPEAKER_13]: 8% CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you can grow a wall of these hops
up the side of your house, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: in vine like ways and, and pull the mature
cones off of the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is that based on dried way to plant
material, those percentages?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you repeat that again, Max?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're looking right now, you're
actually looking at microscopic trichomes
[SPEAKER_13]: pictures of this hybrid of humulis and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can, these are the glandular
trichomes that are producing anywhere
[SPEAKER_13]: between, um, uh, I think 12 to 17% THC in
upwards of five to 8% CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the, the cones are, uh, um,
smokable.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a great image of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, you can definitely tell that this is
not anything like a duck foot or any of
[SPEAKER_13]: the other webbed foot varieties because of
the rest of the shape of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_13]: Notice how there's no, uh, ridges in the
leaf, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if this was duck foot, you would see
leaf ridging and look at the trichome
[SPEAKER_13]: matter coming out of this hop plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I mean, that is really, uh,
uh, quite, uh, quite cannabis indicative.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is, uh, the plant, this is a
cannabis hop plant and this one is
[SPEAKER_13]: growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one took on more of the form of the
cannabis plant and less hop line.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is really like a bushy kind of
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but it is not a hundred percent
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one is another great example,
but this one does have the leaf,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, ridging.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why is because,
um, uh, this is not the same genetic as
[SPEAKER_13]: the last one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, what, uh, what I can tell you about
this genetic is this was actually
[SPEAKER_13]: ruderalis that was cross-bred with,
um, the type of hop plant that receives,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, the cannabis genetics as a cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, is he producing corn, corns,
like from what a hop root is or is it
[SPEAKER_06]: producing seeds?
[SPEAKER_13]: It is producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the hop plant and cannabis both
produce seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the terping profile like hasn't
been tested yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it also have rhizomes reproduce that
way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I was referring to by
correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, um, I am not growing this plant and the
gentleman who created the, the,
[SPEAKER_13]: the first variety that actually took and
turned into an F seven, uh, humulus
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is a friend of mine who got ahold
of the genetic in the United States and
[SPEAKER_13]: crossed it with, um, some marijuana types
that he, he was hybridizing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, indoors and his basement.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is a cannabis leaf that took
on the shape of that hop plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was showing you that has the,
uh, duck foot, but without the leaf
[SPEAKER_13]: ridging.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so here you have a cannabis leaf that
actually took on the smooth leaf edge
[SPEAKER_13]: instead of the ridge edging.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and that's carried down from that hop
line and that hop genetic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so.
[SPEAKER_13]: These genetics are, they're brand spanking
new in the world of species.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is a new species.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about a new species.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and then what's interesting is a
little of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Genetic profile can go back into cannabis
and put some of its genome back into more,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, um, you know, cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's what you're seeing here
with other cannabis farmers breeding into
[SPEAKER_13]: the genetic or breeding the genetic into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And really this just produces a thousand
more questions than it does answers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the terpium profile?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the trichomes look like?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think these are passionate farmers and
breeders doing what they do best,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is just growing this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And seeing what they get, but these guys
aren't putting this stuff under
[SPEAKER_13]: microscopes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, nor are they bringing this stuff to
universities to study, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: the genome profile with, uh, in that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I hope to just assist these
passionate breeders, um, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: by, by helping them bring some of the
genetics to universities and other places
[SPEAKER_13]: to produce some white papers on this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because without question, this is new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is brand new stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, in cannabis, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no longer cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's no longer cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're, we're getting into new
territory.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, very trippy dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was, uh, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's an honor, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like this is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it'd be interesting to like dab
those concentrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what would it concentrate from those,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I go right to that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a, yeah, of course you go
right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Citra Kush, Citra Kush, man all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it's got THC and CBD in it,
why wouldn't they get you high?
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's the question.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does get you high.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is like, how cool is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we're now growing like, and you know,
um, I, uh, because I'm writing about this
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff in the new interpreting book,
I did get the breeder of this hop,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, cannabis hybrid on the phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did about this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got the whole backstory, all the
different genetics went down, where it
[SPEAKER_13]: went down, how it happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I'm writing about all of that,
my new book.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, are you going to drop, uh,
his name?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: In locations and all those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got to get the book.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so, uh, um, but he confirmed that the
purpose of this, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like he wasn't trying to produce a new
species of plant, you know, to get on the
[SPEAKER_13]: cover of national geographic.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that could be, uh,
that could, this could be, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: that could be one of those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: His goal was to try to do something
similar, uh, to the ABC genetic,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can it, can you produce a cannabis plant,
um, that produces cannabis incognito so
[SPEAKER_13]: that Becky next door and the sheriff
across the street don't notice that you've
[SPEAKER_13]: got ganja growing in your yard,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of, and that was his goal,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: What could I produce hops that could grow
as a hops plant that just so happened to
[SPEAKER_13]: be cannabinoid rich in a way in which I
could smoke it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So could I just grow a big hop vine on the
side of my house and just not have to deal
[SPEAKER_13]: with plant counts or if it's medical,
is it legal to have a license for it?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to grow a vine up the side
of my house.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it gets me high, well, then you can
come over for my backyard barbecue and try
[SPEAKER_13]: some of my hops vine.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's, uh, I've confirmed that that
was the, do they also function like cops?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, can you make beer from them?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea why you wouldn't be able
to.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I need to get my hands on this
genetic and work with it because I need to
[SPEAKER_13]: explore a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but it there, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, my understanding of it is, you know,
the, uh, um, the plant that produces gin
[SPEAKER_13]: juniper, Jesus, you know, that juniper is
either a tree or a bush.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like when you're out in the mountains
of Colorado, you see juniper bushes,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then you also see juniper trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think half of these hybrids are more
hop like, and they grow more vines that
[SPEAKER_13]: produce cones that have trichomes on them
that are cannabinoid rich.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the others produce bushes that
are more like cannabis plants that grow
[SPEAKER_13]: more bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and so the ones that are more like hop
plants that grow more like vines,
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have to imagine you could brew,
um, as, as Canna brew, which is a name
[SPEAKER_13]: that I federally trademarked in 2009 when
I thought I was going to produce cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: beer instead of starting a cannabis
education company, which sometimes I still
[SPEAKER_13]: wonder which I should have done.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm, uh, I'll be checking out the book
when it comes out and we'll see,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, we'll go deeper into this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure Nick Ziegler would have been very
interested to hear this today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to send them the link later.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I did want to share a couple of,
uh, your shots, best friend farmer,
[SPEAKER_12]: and maybe you could tell us a little bit
about these shots dude, because I've
[SPEAKER_12]: really been enjoying these shots.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, you're making these like dessert,
like shots that you're taking on
[SPEAKER_12]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's, what's, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that one I can look at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a one 20 micron gas mask,
uh, indoor air dried hash, rosin cake on
[SPEAKER_10]: that one with a beehive stamp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just lovely.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one also, I was just like,
yeah, I liked that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of like, I was on this comfort
food kind of tip, you know, where I was
[SPEAKER_10]: even going back to the food that my mom
made growing up with is kind of eerie
[SPEAKER_10]: almost how closely connected and personal
the hash is to me and those types of
[SPEAKER_10]: foods, which I don't really eat anymore,
but I'm gluten free for five years.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd have to go GF, but, um,
that one is actually Colin likes this too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like an apple cider donut.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colin actually, I think was the one that
said it looked like an apple cider donut
[SPEAKER_10]: with a maple glazing on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one is, uh, on the outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Rosin all along the outside.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all just so well done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I, I did that by just personal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I just, I had fun with that one right
there, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like all of these.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did by hand a couple of them on
a Sunday even, and just kind of like
[SPEAKER_10]: escape from all the industry stuff,
which is so involving.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, you know, to kind of go back to
some artistic touch on it, stuff I like to
[SPEAKER_10]: do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just kind of had fun with the smear
and the, yeah, I remember doing it kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: just like drawing almost and just had fun
with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have it with me here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can show you the actual scale size.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Show us the actual scale size,
but also like, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_12]: You got like a rosin splotch along the
bottom and then you got like a bubble
[SPEAKER_12]: donut with some like diamonds and sauce
poured over it or something like what.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so that's a 90 micron air dried whole
plant cured flower indoor bubble hash for
[SPEAKER_10]: the, the actual donut.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's a 90 micron air dried
whole plant, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some air dried, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a lot of the, the tannin richness on
my air dry, but it's just as saucy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll never go stable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just sauce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's all, it's all in line.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a gas mask, all three.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I got a one 20 micron again,
air dried whole plant cured flower crumble
[SPEAKER_10]: on the sea portion.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just like some chunk that we
didn't say it didn't press.
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of the cool thing is with air
dried is we're seeing some different
[SPEAKER_10]: texture and tan and richness differences
that you don't really get when you have
[SPEAKER_10]: just fresh frozen or freeze dried.
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually applying some of the darker
tannin stuff and it's none of it's BS
[SPEAKER_10]: though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all melty.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like, I'd like to melt the whole donut
sometime.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's try to share the video.
[SPEAKER_12]: The size of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The donuts actually pretty small.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulls out a bunch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for my dirty farmer hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely have my dirty farmer hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: All good.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is absolutely awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to do just the last one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my cookie though, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a one ounce right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I haven't, uh, I'm just about to hit
your cookie right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's look at it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like how come you're not my neighbor?
[SPEAKER_14]: I just actually added you to my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about this one before?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whoopie pie.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like some comfort food from home
from mom.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to dig it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tiny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a couple of micros, kind of like
making micro models type thing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like our fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this guy's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have to say, if you talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it'll go on you, but it'll,
it was on me first.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it went on to John.
[SPEAKER_12]: So show that again, but also talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one here, oops, I'm having a hard
time showing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been kind of pressed up in the
parchment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just tried to preserve them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might auction them off at a local
dispensary friends shop, um, for benefit
[SPEAKER_10]: or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make more.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they call them down there,
but that's what we call them up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoopie pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoopie pie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that one is actually gas mask in the
middle for a rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a 120 micron air dried
indoor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then those were some has cap,
which was Sunday is Sunday brunch by great
[SPEAKER_10]: pie on some broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Air dried stuff, you know, kind of wider
broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the cookie.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can show you guys again.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cookie amazed me how much it looks
like an unbaked cookie.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the chocolate chips made out of
chocolate chips or a broad spectrum also
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of like a wider broad spectrum from
trim hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubble hash all air dried and kind of long
air dry on that stuff, maybe even up to
[SPEAKER_10]: like three weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's got the tannin richness to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll just check myself real quick
to make sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so the chips are two grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a quarter gram each and it's gas
mask actually broad spectrum air dried
[SPEAKER_10]: from the trim and the littles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the cookie was a 26 gram gas
mass, 90 micron air dried.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just this bubble hash that on
the gas mass cultivar is one of those that
[SPEAKER_10]: speaks to the real blonde, creamy,
greasy hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one of those special hash plants
and it kind of retains its creaminess and,
[SPEAKER_10]: and greasy feel even later on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It still has the, the cookies still has it
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounded like when you were like
describing what these different things
[SPEAKER_13]: were, I was just laughing because it just
sounded like such.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're an artist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone, someone should do a book on like
hash that looks like desserts and foods.
[SPEAKER_12]: And your pictures could be highlighted in
that because when I saw them last week,
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to kind of go over them,
but then you were having internet problems
[SPEAKER_12]: or whatever you had to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't bring it up soon enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the time I did bring it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The farming didn't take over so much that
I could come in today and actually get the
[SPEAKER_10]: technology right too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I'm very analog.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd love to share, show more of them
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one from way back.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was going to bring that up to
mention that one of the things that
[SPEAKER_10]: motivated me besides the comfort food
connection, art thing and love for hash
[SPEAKER_10]: was that people just kept dropping bombs
for comments on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: When it came to these types of hash things
from the air dried that we were doing that
[SPEAKER_10]: we make.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of just really struck me to
where, why not make these food items
[SPEAKER_10]: specifically in design towards,
you know, looking like that, that food and
[SPEAKER_10]: hash connection.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's definitely something there just
like with the, with the terpene talk that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: some chocolate.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I grabbed up a piece of,
I thought was chocolate was hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I started eating it and I realized
that, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you're saying that, it looked like
the chocolate chips.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, I got a chocolate chip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've almost eaten a few of the pieces.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just look tasty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they are.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could just like break off a little
like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I've heard before on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some bubble cream right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: A recent gas mask again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a concentrate?
[SPEAKER_13]: Connections.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: The connection that just seems to be there
already.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some good classic kind of broad
spectrum stuff right there too,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gentlemen, I've got some, uh, mycology to
attend to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go bake some horse shit in my
oven before the fiance gets home.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's her favorite.

[SPEAKER_12]: Good call.
