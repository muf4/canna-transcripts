[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here with longtime local Vancouver
activist Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really more than just a Vancouver
activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doing a shit ton for cannabis,
that is for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take Vancouver activist, that's
alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: From editing, cannabis culture magazine,
and then getting into the NDP and the
[SPEAKER_00]: political ring, and getting into sensible
VC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of stuff you can Google on Dana
Larson, including a variety of pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: funny yet educational books, which is the
reason we're here talking to him today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen the post I put up on
Instagram a couple of days ago of the Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seuss parody book, Green Buds and Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dana of course is the author of such
parody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually read it to my 8 month old child
the other day, along with the help from my
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 and 11 year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised at how really,
I mean the rhymes are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely Dr. Seuss like,
but it's actually quite educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really giving education in regards
to ailments and the way cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote this a few years ago actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote the poem about 4 or 5 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's floating around on a lot of different
websites now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The art, my friend, he's a very talented
artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The artist definitely helps make it a
beautiful book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm really pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when I'm writing stuff,
it's really hard to get it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this all just kind of came out in a
big blur of a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The art is definitely on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very Seussian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much on point that there could be a
chance we'll be facing some kind of ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see that there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's too ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little worried about the Seuss
estate coming down on us in some way,
[SPEAKER_01]: about the art and stuff, but all the more
reason to get your copies now before they
[SPEAKER_01]: have any legal problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed mine right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for sale all over the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different shops have them from
CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you send some down to Ignite?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't yet, but I'll be bringing some
by there, but if you want for mail order,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get them right now from the
Cannabis Culture Shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail order is the only place I think
that's doing mail order right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: or for me directly, too, if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're $15, $14.95, $5 shipping,
so for 20 bucks, you can get a copy
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered right to your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they send that to?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they get that information?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can send me an email money
transfer just to my email address,
[SPEAKER_01]: dana at danahlarson.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also take PayPal as well if you want to
contact me for PayPal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My PayPal address is actually book at
harrypothead.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's H-A-I-R-Y, Harry as in what I'm
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm on my face, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, harrypothead.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check that out, or you can just
email me and figure out how to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually reprinting the first Harry
Pothead book again in a couple of weeks as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, so that'll be fun to have both of
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is probably your most well-known
pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's been out for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working steadily on the sequel to it,
but it's taken me a long time because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many other projects I got going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Green Buds and Hash is lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad your children are enjoying it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's legitimate,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first when I saw it, I really thought
it was more of a ha-ha thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw it as like, this is an
actual, this is a really important factor
[SPEAKER_00]: of how we can educate children without the
sort of, I mean, I'm watching throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the media how they're going through all
the years of propaganda and brainwashing
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they're now slowly trying to
retract and pull back a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things like this are extremely
helpful to start early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not, you know,
and for kids, I mean, I kind of see this
[SPEAKER_01]: as an adult thing in a way, like,
you know, I mean, an eight-month child is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be amused by anything you're
doing no matter what, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just like the sound of the blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it normalizes it is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to me, it's just a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't see anything wrong with
kids talking about cannabis or being told
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is a good medicine or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think that probably creates a
healthier attitude towards cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing it as this forbidden thing that
you've got to try in secret and maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: in the best context.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just like I think it's probably
better for kids to try alcohol with their
[SPEAKER_01]: parents perhaps for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having a normalized attitude about
cannabis is similar as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is fun for all ages, certainly,
and grownups can enjoy it as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it and laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a little moral there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got, and I've actually got a whole
bunch of other fairy tales and parodies
[SPEAKER_01]: and things that I've written that are
about this length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the Pie-Eyed Piper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually published in Canada's
Culture Magazine quite a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say that one's going
way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of this stuff's been sitting
around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting the artists in line is
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting the money and the talent and
getting them to spend the time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got the Pie-Eyed Piper coming out
in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another one called The Girl Who
Could Turn Hemp Into Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one actually hasn't been
published anywhere publicly at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping to put out a series of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in another year or so, I'm hoping to
have about five or six of these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: books out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a similar format.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other ones aren't Dr. Seuss
parodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just fairy tales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there shouldn't be any lawsuits over
those ones, I'm hoping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully not on this one either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Satire and parody in Canada are allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel we fall under those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I admit, I'm just a little nervous
that the Seuss estate might decide to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: differently or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly, I love Dr. Seuss like
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no disrespect to him or any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully he would enjoy this and
think it's a fun riff on his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to think that if he ever
enjoyed cannabis in his life, that he
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely find enjoyment in this
particular parody of his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's done with class nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good to be here smoking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much going on these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm in the news like on the media is
calling me nonstop for comment and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that are going on pretty much
since 420 from about 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I've had at least four reporters
calling me for stuff and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some days it's really crazy,
but we've had the dispensary thing
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in Vancouver and all the
kerfuffle and change around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria today just voted like an hour
ago, eight to one to follow the Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: model and basically legalized dispensaries
in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was possible that they were going to
maybe... Yeah, we weren't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we had support, but it was an
eight to one vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were looking for, you know,
to get at least five of those nine votes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but eight to one is really solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one vote against wasn't even
really that strongly against.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was more just sort of like,
this is Ottawa's problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't be fixing their problems for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like he wasn't like marijuana is
cancerous or bad and we should,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but so that's very positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the two biggest cities in BC now
basically tell them the Harper government
[SPEAKER_01]: to get lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to regulate cannabis
dispensaries in the province.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that many other smaller cities
and towns in BC and across Canada are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start following that model as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't just say as a mayor
now, well, the law is the law and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to shut them down because that's the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a choice while you do have a
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that makes it a lot more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in Kelowna, I've been talking to
the folks there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were raided in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just reopened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the police came in two days ago and
said, you have 24 hours to shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city inspector actually came in
with the police officers with them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started off being called the Kaya
clinic and then they got raided and shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They reopened as the okay clinic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so they're got a thing going
weeds is also open one there and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: also getting pressured to shut down in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but yeah, but yeah, so this
means, whereas in West Kelowna and Vernon,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got a couple of dispensaries each
and the city councils are more favourable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to see this playing out
city by city and town by town all across
[SPEAKER_01]: the country as these places continue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I gotta give props to our mayor for
disagreeing with Amber Rose and
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreeing with the things that were
said, which was basically that I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: she made a quote and I, was it your quote
that said maybe she, maybe I'm misquoting
[SPEAKER_00]: her or maybe she meant to say this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading someone's words about
it that she said there was no medical
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said that over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said that what she basically said was
that we have to provide cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: patients because the courts have ruled
that patients believe that it helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to provide it because they
believe that it helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But health Canada knows that marijuana is
not an approved medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a valid medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by extension, basically it's all a
hoax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think marijuana is helping you,
you're actually deluded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the health minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the health minister who runs the
medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously you're not going to have a
successful program when the person whose
[SPEAKER_01]: department it is to be in charge of it,
uh, says that she doesn't believe it
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big hoax and you just believe that
helps you, but you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're actually sponsoring a week of
action against Rona Ambrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something anybody in the country
can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, basically we're going to call all of
her office phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And health Canada numbers all day long,
all next week and explain to them why
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is real medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share with them science and facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share with them your personal stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: What their phone ringing off the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, these numbers are listed on Dana's
page as well as a variety of other pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search Facebook for Dana Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's S E N.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to our website, sensiblebc
.ca slash defend, there's all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's linked from our campaigns
link at the top of the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get about six or eight numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five phone numbers actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's her, it's her Edmonton
office, her Ottawa office, the health
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada office, uh, the health Rona Ambrose
is like media contact office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want him to be able to call any
reporters or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's one more number as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically we're going to be flooding
their office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this similar thing last year when
they were telling medical patients to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis with kitty litter and throw
it away on the curb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so we did a one day day of action
last year and it was very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if you're mad, mad about
this stuff, this is your chance to vent
[SPEAKER_01]: and to all vent together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have, if you're upset about the
way things are going, you don't like what
[SPEAKER_01]: the conservatives are saying and you want
to tell somebody off, well, this is your
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to do that, to get that,
get that, uh, uh, energy out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, directed where it belongs to be at the
federal government, at the minister of
[SPEAKER_01]: health and health Canada and the terrible
job they're doing with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, and if you can do it in the most
intellectually and articulate manner that
[SPEAKER_00]: is respectful and not, uh, you know,
you can't be phoning up and, and
[SPEAKER_00]: threatening and being, you know,
don't threaten anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, you're not going to be
talking to Rona Ambrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be talking to staff
members who work at health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they are probably just people who
are there just to do their job and get
[SPEAKER_01]: paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might not even agree with what
their department's philosophy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be clear, but don't be calling
and swearing at them or threatening them
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or anything phoning in bomb threats or
any crazy stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just talk about why, but keep them on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let them hang up on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let them put you off, explain to
them why canvas helps you, why you believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep them on the phone as long as
possible and, uh, and just bring these
[SPEAKER_01]: things forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really want them to hear personal
stories about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want that whole department buzzing all
week and talking to each other about,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy crap, I got another hundred phone
calls today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly people are upset about what's
happening here and we got to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are effective tools for activism
in different cities that you may live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you might not even be from Canada and
you might have, you might be, elsewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are effective tools for,
for moving your activism forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good ways to go about it and
there's not so good ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dana himself here has been going about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, what are you 20 years in now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're over 20 years now,
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself, I'm also over 20 years in,
started as an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get some pins or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 year pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, uh, we're fighting for a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we believe in and not just for our
own, uh, personal, uh, agenda,
[SPEAKER_00]: personal reasons to for profit or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, and it always has been at
least for me, particularly for people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a voice for themselves,
for the people that really, really need
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant or need access to it,
which is why I am a firm supporter of both
[SPEAKER_00]: LPs and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of dispensaries available
to people right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a shadow of a doubt that
dispensaries are saving the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: people from the LP system.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, the LP system
cannot provide enough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not providing edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not providing salves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not providing the creams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not providing extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge hole considering that is the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty giant hole to leave your,
your patients with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, to me, the dispensaries are,
I mean, they're picking up a lot of slack
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, I still believe the LPs
have a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still believe that LPs are important and
I love the idea of standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard any dispensary owners say
they want LPs shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a better system for LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel kind of sorry for them in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too sorry because none of them are
really stepping up or helping and activism
[SPEAKER_01]: in any way, but I've got to, it's got to
be frustrating to have invested all these
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of dollars, be waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, a lot of them, our LP wannabes
haven't got their permits yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've invested a bunch of money and
they're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the ones that have are under a
regulatory scheme run by a minister who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't believe marijuana has any
medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bureaucracy is very hostile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rules are keeping changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very expensive and challenging and
the patients mostly hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of very negative LP comments
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so you, so you've got a lot of
challenges that are trying to run this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of them are people who
are just in it for the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others, I think, are people who love
cannabis and want to help people and are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do the right thing and are
frustrated, you know, by this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those good folks are ones who
haven't got their permits yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually is what I've found.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are my friends are the
ones that they're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few folks from the dispensary
community that have made it into the LP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Philip Lucas is working with Tilray
and he originally was one of the very
[SPEAKER_01]: first dispensaries in Canada back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so there is that, but what we
need ultimately is a better regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one that works differently and one
that, you know, people say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you want to buy all your marijuana from
LPs at your dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, well, if most of my suppliers
could become LPs fairly easily,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they should be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should only be some oversight and
some, some testing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they can fall through the
standards, as long as they make it through
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the standards is what will
separate the, you know, the heads from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the standards need to be something
that's not limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not those only rolling and allow a
dozen people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fair system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A standard is keeping a certain bar high.
[SPEAKER_00]: A standard is testing for microbials and
making sure that the cannabis has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed with chemicals, which we could
involve just like organic testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: farming does is having someone come and
make sure that you're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are standards, not saying,
Hey, only 10 people can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't support that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, my long-term vision for what
legalization really means is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be farmers growing marijuana by the
thousands of hectares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wouldn't be so much in that kind
of model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are still going to be into
their perfectly manicured buds for smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: joints and whatnot, but that kind of stuff
I think would fall by the wayside because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to start off with the
perfect bud to make a perfect extract at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, if you're growing it by the,
by the hectare and you've got thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of resin with, which is rich in the
cannabinoids, you can tweak that and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop it or grow the right strains to
have whatever cannabinoid profile you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not a big fan of some of the
extracts that are made because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: being made in people's homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble hash obviously is very safe and
pure and clean like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only use a water extracted resin for
our MJ creams there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice little, right on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made with pure water extracted marijuana
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the MJ creams, MJCreams.ca.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a number of different kinds and
we're in about 25 stores now and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of research and personal
experience that topical salves and creams
[SPEAKER_01]: that are marijuana infused work really
well for all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been selling these things for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've added a few essential oils to
diversify them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a great ingredient list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase their, increase their potency and
effectiveness medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's some good products I
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been selling them at the
dispensary for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, outdoor cannabis grown by the
hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this growing buds in a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot harder to like grow,
to keep buds safe from mold and mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: things because it's such an organic living
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have an extract that you
can make at any potency, any level of
[SPEAKER_01]: purity with any level of terpenes and
flavonoids grown in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, that I think is the long-term
future of marijuana and what I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can still grow some in their
backyard or they grow tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, and that should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people will still do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be more of a hobbyist kind of
a thing than a big money-making kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's the future in the
long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be a while before we get
from here to there also, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors definitely, fields and fields is
where it's got to be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that put us underground and
inside with lights is prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once prohibition is lifted,
there's really no more reason to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition-based models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be a slow transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that potentially, in Canada I think
here, could potentially be solved by
[SPEAKER_00]: offering a third type of license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let MMAR patients have their licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let LPs have licenses but don't limit
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the standards high and offer a third
type of licensing for all those growers
[SPEAKER_00]: who are currently growing under an MMAR
license but growing to produce cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for others so that they sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them have another type of license
where, okay, if you're growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, you don't need to test for
microbials and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're putting it on an open market
and selling it, then perhaps those
[SPEAKER_00]: standards should be put into place to
protect the end user.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how we do wine on other things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to brew wine in your home and
share it with your friends and family
[SPEAKER_01]: without cost, there's not really much
oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's inspecting your wine or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to sell it in the store,
yeah, I want it to know it's pure and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to contain toxic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to know that if it says organic
on the label, someone's actually checking
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure it's actually produced
organically and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the wine market has got small-scale
niche producers that just do very limited
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got medium producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got really giant companies that make
millions of gallons of wine a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's room for all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Room for everybody who wants to get
involved and who can produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: high-quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be able to participate in the
market if they want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of future we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for sitting down and chatting
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should offer you a lovely boner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit of the D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sift left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little carve there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone wants to see that carb
cap get put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put that carb cap on,
you get like 42 compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you carve your bro's bowl,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you leave him hanging?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a big difference, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can definitely see how it...
Huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the little hole, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what it feels like after a while
when you put the dab in and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: taking your rip without this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts feeling like you're pulling down
this really big straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not own a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not really dab unless somebody comes
over or I'm out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you pump a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do smoke joints, but I put bubble hash
and other stuff in them usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supercharged in that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supercharged in my VBs, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you sitting down with
me, and you guys definitely have a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things to Google in regards
to things that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Order this book, Green Bugs and Hash,
available at the cannabisculture.com
[SPEAKER_01]: store, or for me directly for 20 bucks.
