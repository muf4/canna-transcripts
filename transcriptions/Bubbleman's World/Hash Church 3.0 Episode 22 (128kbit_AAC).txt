[SPEAKER_10]: under this computer as well so now we're
live on YouTube apparently so I'll just
[SPEAKER_10]: wait for it to go pop up and then I'll
share the link with uh with everyone all
[SPEAKER_10]: right there it is we're live welcome
everybody welcome to another episode of
[SPEAKER_10]: Hash Church it's been about a month since
we popped one of these off we are still in
[SPEAKER_10]: Hash Church 3.0 episode 22 I don't know
how many we've done so far but we've got a
[SPEAKER_10]: cool group today with a couple of new
folks that haven't been in the room before
[SPEAKER_10]: so welcome to both Max and and Nick
awesome to have you guys here yeah welcome
[SPEAKER_10]: to uh Skunkman Sam of course and Wade
Laughter a couple of OGs in the house I
[SPEAKER_10]: like it you got the OGs you got some new
folks we gotta keep uh we're all rungs in
[SPEAKER_10]: the ladder after all of the the beautiful
tricone that we love so much Johnny
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking B is in the house how are you
doing Johnny fucking B?
[SPEAKER_10]: there he is Johnny B what's up dude I
don't know man I just I you bring a smile
[SPEAKER_09]: to my face when I see you it's always
great to see everybody this morning hell
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah hey Johnny B I'm moving slowly today
because I uh herniated my disc oh dude
[SPEAKER_09]: yesterday Tuesday mulch huh when did you
do that yeah that's what happens when you
[SPEAKER_09]: actually uh I think it was probably
Tuesday or Wednesday because I ended up in
[SPEAKER_09]: the hospital not live yet ended up in the
hospital on Thursday and Friday and I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: just like how did you get I'm sorry to
hear I went for a walk keep in mind John
[SPEAKER_10]: has broken almost every bone in his body
when he fell 30 feet off the scissor lift
[SPEAKER_10]: that he was working on some years ago
shattered like the side of his body ended
[SPEAKER_10]: up on all the opioids you guys have all
heard the story so it makes sense that
[SPEAKER_10]: John could go for a walk and absolutely
herniate his disc funny enough John
[SPEAKER_10]: yesterday I was on my electric skateboard
with my son in Squamish ripping around and
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a little confident and I went up
this big bank and I was kind of like
[SPEAKER_10]: halfway through I was like what am I doing
I've got my six-year-old son on the board
[SPEAKER_10]: with me well I bailed pretty good too and
uh sprained my wrist so I'm just kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: you know this is what happens when we get
older we get we get a lot more fragile we
[SPEAKER_09]: have to slow down and then you look at her
like when we were kids we're like yeah so
[SPEAKER_09]: you know the idea is to when you go for a
walk don't try and walk for two hours well
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you this Moxley's Mr. Moxley's
salve Mr. Moxley's salves I think you met
[SPEAKER_10]: these guys with me before this is a good
product I gotta say I have like 20 salves
[SPEAKER_10]: at the house here and I was rubbing them
all over my wrist over the course of the
[SPEAKER_10]: last two days including this non-cannabis
one from from sage or sage whatever they
[SPEAKER_09]: call it nice I got this this is the goods
really good to get all these creams and
[SPEAKER_09]: all the stuff they have I actually have
about six or seven in my bathroom so I
[SPEAKER_09]: have one from Jerry James I got MJM creams
I got I got so many different ones Buddha
[SPEAKER_09]: bars all these different creams and bars
and they all have different ingredients so
[SPEAKER_09]: they actually work different ways some got
that eucalyptus smell or they got
[SPEAKER_09]: different fragrances and just those smells
actually right so I love the creams when
[SPEAKER_10]: you need them they're great but Johnny B's
get he's getting into the sensory science
[SPEAKER_10]: of cannabis and that's literally why I
invited our two newest guests today Max
[SPEAKER_10]: Montrose who does the interpeening over in
Colorado and has amazing books and I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna let him do a little introduction on
himself and then afterwards we'll talk to
[SPEAKER_10]: Nick Ziegler who I was lucky enough to get
introduced to via Jeremy Plum and of
[SPEAKER_10]: course when I first met Jeremy I just I
just you know we got right into a whole
[SPEAKER_10]: ton of conversations went extremely deep
down the rabbit hole and he was like man
[SPEAKER_10]: you got to meet my friend Nick you know
he's like the he's like the bubble man of
[SPEAKER_10]: hops I'm telling you you got to meet this
guy I was like oh shit well funny enough I
[SPEAKER_10]: just mentioned Jeremy Plum and who shows
up into the room but Jeremy Plum so
[SPEAKER_10]: perfect timing Jeremy your ears must have
been burning I literally just mentioned
[SPEAKER_10]: you and how you introduced me to Nick and
yeah I guess we really just started but I
[SPEAKER_10]: want to maybe let Max tell us a little bit
about all the things he's been doing for
[SPEAKER_10]: the last few years and introduce himself
to Hash Church I'm sure he's very well
[SPEAKER_10]: known in the cannabis community but some
of the Hash Church people might be it
[SPEAKER_10]: might be new to him so give it a go Max
welcome to Hash Church we're happy to have
[SPEAKER_10]: you what have you been up to tell us we
want to hear about it thank you so much
[SPEAKER_06]: for having me on Hash Church I've wanted
to be on for a long time so it's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: great to be hanging out with all you guys
what's up everybody what's up Hash Church
[SPEAKER_06]: followers if you guys don't know me I'm
Max Montrose I started the Tricom
[SPEAKER_06]: Institute we're a cannabis education
company that likes to do the best job we
[SPEAKER_06]: can to mitigate the misinformation that is
prolific in our industry and teach people
[SPEAKER_06]: things that we know to be real and true
based off of lots of hard work lots of
[SPEAKER_06]: research and we have a different approach
to cannabis in a variety of different ways
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to bore you with all of our
courses and classes online and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: different stuff we do I'll tell you more
about the sensory stuff since this is kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of what that show is is about I started a
program called interpreting and
[SPEAKER_06]: interpreting came out first in 2014 and
the idea of interpreting is a an approach
[SPEAKER_06]: to cannabis from more than an expert level
simply because it's pretty common that
[SPEAKER_06]: when we meet cannabis experts they don't
necessarily even know a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: anatomic features of a cannabis flower how
many different types of trichomes of plant
[SPEAKER_06]: grows or different functions are and so
many other things such as even what's the
[SPEAKER_06]: proper name of those little pistols many
cannabis experts don't know those things
[SPEAKER_06]: but further from an expertise perspective
and more than an expertise from a
[SPEAKER_06]: sommelier perspective how can we
intimately engage with cannabis flower in
[SPEAKER_06]: a way so intelligent that we can actually
gauge where on the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_06]: psychopharmacy between stimulating to
sedative any domesticated hybrid plant
[SPEAKER_06]: type will fall within by just engaging it
with with our with ourselves so no strain
[SPEAKER_06]: name no lab testing what is the quality of
this flower what is the quality of this
[SPEAKER_06]: product and how is this product going to
make you feel psychotropically and how
[SPEAKER_06]: would you know that and so our program
utilizes three different cranial nerves
[SPEAKER_06]: and the one that's kind of the coolest is
our fifth cranial nerve which is the
[SPEAKER_06]: trigeminal nerve which is the largest
aspect of interpreting methodology which
[SPEAKER_06]: is our actual ability to organize how and
where terpenes accumulate in group within
[SPEAKER_06]: the totality of themselves in in the
flower and your ability to actually feel
[SPEAKER_06]: their quantum mechanic vibrations that do
vibrate in certain in particular ways and
[SPEAKER_06]: we actually instruct people how to sense
and feel when cannabis is vibrating in
[SPEAKER_06]: more of a stimulating pattern or more of a
sedative pattern and how to kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: analyze the flower in other ways to kind
of put it on a spectrum of you know what
[SPEAKER_06]: is this what is this hybrid plant what are
we working with so that's just kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: that's just a good way to scratch the
surface of of interpreting and i would
[SPEAKER_06]: love to answer any of your questions and
and dive deep into it if you'd like i love
[SPEAKER_10]: the i love the sensory science aspect of
what you're doing and i i know you know i
[SPEAKER_10]: i dug down it i always found it very
interesting we communicated a little bit i
[SPEAKER_10]: i sent you some pictures early on for one
of your books that you did and i just i
[SPEAKER_10]: love what you're doing man i i think that
um i see more and more people sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: taking this new approach and i you know i
think gonjir is has started a sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: sommelier type course you've got yours
going like the more that we can get of
[SPEAKER_10]: this and the more we can kind of figure
out like what is it going to be called
[SPEAKER_10]: that cannabis sommelier because it's going
to be a different term i think but it's
[SPEAKER_10]: the one we use when we because we're just
at the start of of of this sort of road
[SPEAKER_10]: but i i i literally have to pause take a
quick break and say what's up to my homie
[SPEAKER_10]: rick delisi who just came into the room i
haven't talked i haven't talked to this
[SPEAKER_10]: guy since his father got let out of prison
after jesus christ rick was it 32 years
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah 32 fucking years can you hear me in
the hell bro i can hear you so well man
[SPEAKER_10]: i've been watching you with your father
with his granddaughter with the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: family dude it's been bringing tears to my
eyes i knew you were i knew you were tuned
[SPEAKER_13]: in i knew you were tuned in i felt your
presence and like bro it's just been a
[SPEAKER_13]: fucking whirlwind like me but it's fucking
awesome and um i know you're one of the
[SPEAKER_13]: people that touched a lot do i remember
talk no you did you did so much for it so
[SPEAKER_13]: it was like you brought me not alone but
you and the cannabis community put me a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot in the forefront because of my
father's situation and slowly but surely i
[SPEAKER_13]: got to the people who were necessary to
get my father proper advocation and he was
[SPEAKER_13]: released december 28th this year thank god
and he's in decent health um we're we're
[SPEAKER_13]: struggling to get him up and running as a
certain factor in the industry in some
[SPEAKER_13]: sense kind of get a little sort of
restitution for him but everything seems
[SPEAKER_13]: to be going well and i just got my head up
and i'm super thankful for all the
[SPEAKER_10]: reception and man i mean well i'm down for
some of that bubble bags wants to support
[SPEAKER_10]: his re-entry you you hooked me up on the
sidelines dude and i'll do whatever i can
[SPEAKER_10]: for that i'll never forget you know that
sort of perspective i gave you and it
[SPEAKER_10]: might have been in barcelona or amsterdam
one day when we were talking about our old
[SPEAKER_10]: man and i was telling you how mine died on
the motorcycle accident i said look dude
[SPEAKER_10]: your dad's he's gone but he's not gone
you're gonna get him back and you and i
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't remember i didn't believe it
because it had been so long and i know so
[SPEAKER_13]: many trials and tribulations i was like i
was like yeah that shit's easier said than
[SPEAKER_13]: done but you know i didn't give up and
through the network of a great few people
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah he's he's free and he's now um an
emancipated human holy christ dude you
[SPEAKER_02]: would have gotten out sooner rick except
for that was the problem exactly you know
[SPEAKER_13]: you know the deal absolutely so yeah on
that note i'm gonna have a dab um awesome
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah it's so good to see you dude i wasn't
sure if you were gonna have time or be
[SPEAKER_10]: able to come out and whatnot and i'll be
honest dude like part of me was kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: like i didn't want to um like try to be
one of those people that were gonna be
[SPEAKER_10]: like you know i always just wanted to give
you a place to to sort of share the story
[SPEAKER_13]: but once he got out we don't have to i
wanted to be more receptive but it's also
[SPEAKER_13]: like at a certain point i was so hounded
upon the release it was like i think on
[SPEAKER_13]: the 15th day i just said to my dad like
dude i'm not answering another news
[SPEAKER_13]: company i'm not answering another press
call because they were like getting to the
[SPEAKER_13]: point that they wanted to do like first
they did my 21 year old daughter in a
[SPEAKER_13]: story and then they wanted my 12 year old
i was like no after the 14th day i said
[SPEAKER_13]: like look everybody's got to leave my dad
was like no we got two more barbecues with
[SPEAKER_13]: every i said dad i can't take it anymore
like it's been 14 days of non-stop like
[SPEAKER_13]: but it it's all worth it in good
retrospect it's just like you know i
[SPEAKER_13]: really appreciated just going back this
time and having that two weeks with him
[SPEAKER_13]: alone that was groundbreaking for me dude
i can't believe your what were you 11
[SPEAKER_10]: years old when your dad got pulled yeah so
you're 11 years old he goes to prison he
[SPEAKER_10]: gets out your son is 12 years old my
daughter's 12 years old your daughter yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah i have three daughters i have three
daughters i got a 21 year old a 12 year
[SPEAKER_13]: old and a two-year-old that's right he had
never met he had never met the 12 and the
[SPEAKER_13]: two-year-old but it it's all good they
know each other now and they like each
[SPEAKER_13]: other a lot so it's fucking cool bro it's
like it's weird you know you want to hear
[SPEAKER_13]: the weirdest thing this is what and this
isn't a good thing but it runs through my
[SPEAKER_13]: head kind of shocking the snitch is dead
and my dad's free you know what i mean so
[SPEAKER_13]: and my dad is lightweight healthy and the
snitch is dead so it's like and he died of
[SPEAKER_13]: natural causes we didn't have to do
anything it's just like and i'm not saying
[SPEAKER_13]: i'm glad he's dead that's not what i'm
saying i'm just saying no dude i get you i
[SPEAKER_10]: get you i get you it is well it's played
it's it played out the way it was supposed
[SPEAKER_10]: to i'll be uh hitting the bull with you as
well later on max i want to get into a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit of uh how you guys look at the
different methods of inhaling and not just
[SPEAKER_10]: the different methods but also off the
different you know whether you're inhaling
[SPEAKER_10]: off of say silicone carbide whether you're
inhaling off of quartz whether you're
[SPEAKER_10]: inhaling off of sapphire you know all of
these different surfaces and i don't know
[SPEAKER_10]: how deep you've gone into this max but if
you haven't i suggest hooking you up with
[SPEAKER_10]: brian schroeder from d-mail who seems to
be like all he focuses on is the way the
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes are preserved or destroyed based
on how the surface area holds retains and
[SPEAKER_10]: releases heat and it's a whole other
rabbit hole and i'm sure you've done some
[SPEAKER_10]: experimenting for me i got pretty lucky
with with blue yeah the slurper i mean
[SPEAKER_10]: this is kind of a slurper right here i got
the original they have so much air intake
[SPEAKER_13]: so the oxygen just pushes the vapor
through yeah i got that one too i like
[SPEAKER_13]: that one a lot the blender yeah i got the
blender right here that's what's up that's
[SPEAKER_10]: what's up so i got all the jp gave me this
a long while ago and i've never used this
[SPEAKER_10]: and now i'm having a hard time using it
because someone told me they sold for like
[SPEAKER_10]: 1200 us dollars and i was like 1200 us
dollars for a banger that seems uh that
[SPEAKER_10]: seems fairly extreme ewok glass shipped me
out this one it was a custom 10 milli for
[SPEAKER_10]: my little uh dustin revere here oh dude
it's so the revere of raindrops the first
[SPEAKER_10]: time i smoked this little this little
banger i just was like i'll just hit a
[SPEAKER_10]: normal size dab dude i felt like i was in
grade eight i got so high i not only
[SPEAKER_10]: wanted to run like just wherever i wanted
to run out of my skin it was that intense
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh you guys know i puff a lot my first
slab my first slurpers did the same to me
[SPEAKER_13]: it was like everybody was like have you
ever had a turf so i was like yeah
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever bro i had big dabs come on let's
do it put a normal dab on it was just like
[SPEAKER_13]: oh at the end i was just like holy shit
this is a whole another anyways yeah true
[SPEAKER_13]: innovation thanks for uh welcoming to
welcoming me to hash church did you want
[SPEAKER_06]: me to answer some of these things while
you're loading the bowl and think about
[SPEAKER_06]: hell yeah yes so um i don't want to
disappoint you but uh interpreting in and
[SPEAKER_06]: of itself has not yet moved into hash and
concentrates from an interpreting
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective and the reason for that is the
amount of work that needs to be done and
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're doing from a cannabis and uh
sommelier perspective and so we're
[SPEAKER_06]: currently we're still not done developing
and learning the the flower aspects of uh
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis appellation which is brand new
cannabis is it real or not and who says so
[SPEAKER_06]: and what is cannabis and how would you
work with it in different capacities and
[SPEAKER_06]: then within that what about topicity and
topicity is a term that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry doesn't know yet that's a term
from viniculture where certain wines have
[SPEAKER_06]: tastes that are of typical that typical
unique thing that could only be that one
[SPEAKER_06]: certain thing so the way that durban
poison has a flavor and an aroma that is
[SPEAKER_06]: unlike anything else in the world there's
no fruit there's no flower there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: perfume there's no plant there's nothing
in the world that smells like durban
[SPEAKER_06]: poison and it has and retains that unique
flavor sense so much so that it's a unique
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristic that that's recognizable
well what is what how do you how do you
[SPEAKER_06]: call that what is that that is its
topicity um and so our ability to certify
[SPEAKER_06]: og genetics if if you go to a dispensary
and you're selling jack harer it better
[SPEAKER_06]: damn smell and be in jack harer but how do
you do that with cannabis morphology and
[SPEAKER_06]: how do you do that with a black market
culture that has said hey dude i got jack
[SPEAKER_06]: harer just so that Florida needs that so
bad right and so so this is what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: working on is is actually being able to
certify the topicity of these og genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: and these og varietals to give them the
truth in the marketplace that they deserve
[SPEAKER_06]: and so our our work with just flower alone
is megalithic right and we're also working
[SPEAKER_06]: on apps to to do to basically build what
leaf lee always wishes it was which is an
[SPEAKER_06]: actual application where if you said you
know what i want to look for cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_06]: way where i'm going to shop for a
particular feeling which might not come
[SPEAKER_06]: from a strain name or a lab test and so
our ability to use interpreting
[SPEAKER_06]: methodology and also extremely
sophisticated lab work we're partnered
[SPEAKER_06]: with guys who actually build a cannabis
aroma supercomputer and they're visually
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing in three-dimensional gas
chromatography the full scope of of
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes well over a hundred terpenes
their alcohols and their theols and their
[SPEAKER_06]: polyphenols that contribute to this true
complexity of where aroma is coming from
[SPEAKER_06]: like a lot of people think that the gas
note in cannabis is a terpene and a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people think that that terpene is
terpenally and what we're finding is is
[SPEAKER_06]: that gas is a feel and so how do we work
with feels in in the way that you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: were just saying so you're talking about
using different bangers for the purposes
[SPEAKER_06]: of terpenes and you're talking about going
down rabbit holes it's like all right well
[SPEAKER_06]: here's a whole brand new world called
flavorants and how do we how do we operate
[SPEAKER_06]: with the complexity of the flavors and
aromas characteristics that cannabis truly
[SPEAKER_06]: has to offer and these are things that i'm
still learning about and i'm still
[SPEAKER_06]: exploring so you know that that's kind of
where interpreting is right now but we
[SPEAKER_06]: also believe that interpreting can and
does and deserve to move into the world of
[SPEAKER_06]: concentrates and that's where i would want
help from guys who know concentrates way
[SPEAKER_06]: better than i do because i'm a flower dude
just all day backyard flowers just growing
[SPEAKER_06]: in horseshit behind the house just raw
stinky ganja cooking in the sun that's my
[SPEAKER_02]: jam realize that terpenes were so
important what's that when did i realize
[SPEAKER_06]: that terpenes were so important yes um you
know i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you the
truth about this uh it was when i was
[SPEAKER_06]: buying cannabis as a kid on the black
market before there was dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_06]: when i would smoke certain flowers they
affected me so dramatically in such
[SPEAKER_06]: different ways that i was actually able to
stop taking pain medication for my crooked
[SPEAKER_06]: spine or anxiety medication for for my
anxiety or stop taking adderall as a child
[SPEAKER_06]: just to pay attention in school because
when i started smoking island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: and golden goat i just realized i i can
pay attention because these herbs are
[SPEAKER_06]: stimulants the way that adderall is a
stimulant except when i take adderall i
[SPEAKER_06]: can't eat i can't sleep and i'm an asshole
and that's what meth does to you because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's meth adderall is an amphetamine
salt ritalin is methylphenidate and they
[SPEAKER_06]: give kids meth as scholastic performance
enhancement it is not medicating a
[SPEAKER_06]: debilitating condition all right so i'm
basically taking meth pills as a kid just
[SPEAKER_06]: to do better in school because i'm add and
dyslexic up until the point i smoke golden
[SPEAKER_06]: goat i'm like oh my gosh i can pay
attention when i smoke goat or island
[SPEAKER_06]: sweet skunk but the the side effects are
the opposite i can eat i can sleep and i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: in a good mood and so it changed my
fucking life when i found cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_06]: i could take care of myself and stop
taking these medications but only if i
[SPEAKER_06]: could organize and compartmentalize how
different flower types affect me in the
[SPEAKER_06]: different ways that it does and so as a
naturalist and as a a chronic observer of
[SPEAKER_06]: all things nature and as a dominant super
taster chemically and genetically i
[SPEAKER_06]: actually started paying attention to and
realizing how how and where the terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: were felt in different parts of the face
way before i knew what terpenes were and
[SPEAKER_06]: also way before i knew what the trigeminal
nerve was that there are actually nerve
[SPEAKER_06]: endings between your ophthalmic bulb and
your maxillary gland of the trigeminal
[SPEAKER_06]: nerve that is a sensory perception cranial
nerve so i didn't know any of that stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: until i kept learning and kept going down
the rabbit hole and kept exploring what is
[SPEAKER_06]: this what what do we have here because
we've got something here we can organize
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and the organization works within
the inflorescence of the cola structure
[SPEAKER_06]: it's its shape context plus its smell
context and plus where you're feeling the
[SPEAKER_06]: aroma of the smell in in different parts
of your face those are three cranial
[SPEAKER_06]: nerves that we pull together which is
interpreting we're interpreting the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes of these flower types to gauge
them and put them on these different
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrums i don't know if you guys have
ever seen this but this is a little cheat
[SPEAKER_06]: sheet i made and uh we're actually
switching out the leaves for buds and if
[SPEAKER_06]: you i can open up the book and show you
the book and actually the weed meal is
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of a good example too so um so
instead of saying satiba because it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: what it is is it is narrow leaf marijuana
that's what this is this is a narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana and where you feel the smell
what type of smell what the flower
[SPEAKER_06]: structure looks like that affects your
body in certain ways here's the gauge of
[SPEAKER_06]: an nlm would physically affect you
energetically mentally it's stimulating
[SPEAKER_06]: your focus is productive your mood is
adventurous your risk is paranoia and your
[SPEAKER_06]: activity could be concerts or creative
arts how intoxicated you'll become is
[SPEAKER_06]: dependent on your personal tolerance and
then we go through the spectrum of the
[SPEAKER_06]: five effect types of flower um with this
tool and then simultaneously this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: tool that organizes uh your flower types
in its different effect spectrum similarly
[SPEAKER_06]: and we we tell people that the original
term or industry term is indica to sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: but in reality you're talking about
subspecies and the subspeciation of flower
[SPEAKER_06]: types within the broad to narrow leaf
spectrum within the category of marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: are generally indica subspecies and so
this is really a spectrum between sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: species subspecies afganica indica variety
afganica to sativa species subspecies
[SPEAKER_06]: indica variety indica um and so really
trying to teach people that it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: indica or sativa the speciation
subspeciation and then the varietals
[SPEAKER_06]: thereof um are more complex um but anyways
you can open this card up and we also
[SPEAKER_06]: teach you know the quality uh poor quality
characteristics as well as all of your
[SPEAKER_06]: positive quality characteristics what
you're smelling from a terpene perspective
[SPEAKER_06]: and how those terpenes interact with you
in your face so this is just one of our
[SPEAKER_06]: fun little tools that we used to part of
our little toolkit yeah that's fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: awesome yeah that's what i said that's
that's awesome yeah go ahead go ahead sam
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to hear from sam there's a weak
pride to determine if people could smell
[SPEAKER_02]: more than one or two terpenes by smelling
cannabis and uh everybody fails well you
[SPEAKER_06]: know i've got a good one for you sam the
terpene supercomputer that i i'm friends
[SPEAKER_06]: with now they called bullshit on
interpreting they're like there's no way
[SPEAKER_06]: that you can just smell unable cannabis
and categorize the chemistry effect type
[SPEAKER_06]: of it and so they bought me an airplane
ticket flew me out to their lab in
[SPEAKER_06]: california where they had previously lab
tested eight different types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: that could not have been more different
from each other one was harvested that
[SPEAKER_06]: week another was over a year old some were
six months old they had hardcore sativas
[SPEAKER_06]: hardcore indicas they had og types where
you should have recognized the topicity of
[SPEAKER_06]: a classic genetic they had just the whole
spread and they're all guys in white lab
[SPEAKER_06]: coats and then they invited the dispensary
owners of lbca the los angeles dispensary
[SPEAKER_06]: organization so the the ogs who have been
having dispensaries in la probably longer
[SPEAKER_06]: than anybody else in the us to all watch
me do this to see like can this guy
[SPEAKER_06]: actually go about an unlabeled jar of
cannabis and tell us all everything about
[SPEAKER_06]: its quality what its plant shape would
have looked like and how its chemical
[SPEAKER_06]: effect is going to be uh based off of
their lab analysis and jar after jar i got
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm just talking about the terpene
contents all the other stuff it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: much more possible but terpenes if because
an average cannabis variety has 50 60
[SPEAKER_02]: different terpenes and uh most people can
name one or two from if it's really loud
[SPEAKER_02]: and really dominant but they can't name
anymore because it's just too difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: for them or they don't have the experience
yeah but now we're moving into the future
[SPEAKER_10]: sam see you're you're you're like the
fucking base rung on the ladder dude like
[SPEAKER_10]: we're all like without you dude like none
of us would be where we are that's a fact
[SPEAKER_10]: but when i listen to max it sounds like
he's right on the fucking money with shit
[SPEAKER_10]: that you've already done in a more sort of
simplistic range and he's taking it to
[SPEAKER_10]: this like futuristic like i'll just say
this i go with my gut and everything max
[SPEAKER_10]: just said fucking sounded proper i i'm
interested i like it yeah right on and
[SPEAKER_13]: this is definitely something serious in
the wine industry so i always wondered
[SPEAKER_13]: when it would become prevalent in the
cannabis industry yeah and after nick
[SPEAKER_06]: talks because i want to hear from nick as
well um if you if you'd like rick um
[SPEAKER_06]: organizing cannabis as a commodity in as
in selling it in operating at it from a
[SPEAKER_06]: wine and viniculture perspective makes a
thousand times more sense than what we've
[SPEAKER_06]: been doing in our mom's basement for the
past 20 30 years but that's what's kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: happened in the past five years is that
there's become such a fine um knowledge of
[SPEAKER_13]: the preference of which terpenes people
want and so forth at first it was like yo
[SPEAKER_13]: if i got some good weed it's good weed
boom we're good now people want their
[SPEAKER_13]: certain like range of what they want their
gelato or their og's or their you know
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever kush their their preference the
cookies or it's just funny to see but
[SPEAKER_13]: that's that was that is the next step with
um with cannabis i i've been feeling it
[SPEAKER_13]: for a while just wine was always respected
that way once it was brought into the and
[SPEAKER_13]: even beer ipa's they're really respected
in the market of flavors you know so
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is definitely but even even just
even from a more basic perspective because
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're talking about is is truly
complex but from a way more basic
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective just just imagine this just
for a second a sophisticated wine shopper
[SPEAKER_06]: would never walk into an alcohol store and
ask for a variety of grape at a percentage
[SPEAKER_06]: of alcohol for for the bottle of wine that
they're looking for that's just fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculous people laugh at that idea
they're like yeah but it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_06]: sense it's like exactly but that's what we
do with weed and it doesn't make sense
[SPEAKER_06]: whereas in wine if you walk into a liquor
store and tell the guy you know red or
[SPEAKER_06]: white right a stimulating type or sedative
type red perfect what country usa what
[SPEAKER_06]: region northern california what type of uh
what type of variety max you're ignoring
[SPEAKER_07]: the mad dog 2020 customer base and the uh
everybody who wants this he's like he's
[SPEAKER_11]: like well what about two buck chuck you
know what that's not that's not the type
[SPEAKER_06]: of customer you know and like like if
you're the kind of customer that does not
[SPEAKER_06]: care you just want to get high or you just
want to get drunk that's what two buck
[SPEAKER_06]: chuck is for and that's what like sacks of
cheap flour are for but that's not the
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of guys we're hanging out with on
hash church that watch hash church either
[SPEAKER_06]: so uh you know this is just a different
breed but but the point is is if we were
[SPEAKER_06]: to compartmentalize cannabis like wine
we're gonna get to a point where we say
[SPEAKER_06]: hey dude what are you looking for like man
i'm looking for some skunky garlicky og
[SPEAKER_06]: funk that's gonna lay me out but get me
thinking it's like okay i got something
[SPEAKER_06]: for you i regardless of the lab test and
regardless of the strain name like i don't
[SPEAKER_06]: give a fuck what you call it i know what
you're looking for and i can tell you how
[SPEAKER_06]: good it is what quality it is when it was
harvested how ripe it is and how loud it
[SPEAKER_06]: is from a chemical perspective and i can i
can offer it to you in a fun cool creative
[SPEAKER_06]: way and i can also make it sound so
fucking sexy too i mean you're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about a og varietal from the appellations
of the emerald triangle within a unique
[SPEAKER_06]: terroir that filters the oceanic air twice
a day through the pine trees giving fresh
[SPEAKER_06]: air on the cannabis types that sit in a
fog on top of the mountainside called
[SPEAKER_06]: alpenglow where the it's like in the san
francisco's shale content that's
[SPEAKER_06]: indigenous to the soil that the cannabis
farmers are knowledgeable about and glow
[SPEAKER_06]: for us this is what it means to be a
cannabis sommelier this is it this is what
[SPEAKER_06]: we're doing you know that's it that's
awesome this conversation i want to jump
[SPEAKER_03]: in here for a minute i came aware of
terpenes and their importance of from
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutic point of view because trying
to help young people with seizure
[SPEAKER_03]: disorders and really found that early on
of course i thought it was cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: cvd particularly that seemed to give this
benefit that we were seeking but i can to
[SPEAKER_03]: realize yeah that terpenes seemed to have
an important role and i'm realizing
[SPEAKER_03]: increasingly maybe i don't even know that
but i'm wondering max in your exploration
[SPEAKER_03]: on flowers you started off describing your
experience based on therapeutic benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: you personally experienced is what drove
your interest i'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts on um and again i'm mostly
talking concentrates because none of these
[SPEAKER_03]: kids smoke joints or or uh hit on their uh
dab rate but um we've seen really dramatic
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in benefit for uh seizure
disorder in certain kids with this type of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that has similar cannabinoids as
this type of cannabis but really different
[SPEAKER_03]: results based on cannabinoid test results
and yet we see dramatic difference so i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering have you gone any further down
that path and if you haven't i'd really
[SPEAKER_03]: like to engage with you some more on what
little i've learned over the years on that
[SPEAKER_03]: one and uh explore potential uh benefit
for those kids because there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people out there who sees on a regular
basis and it's always a drag this is way
[SPEAKER_06]: thanks from a seizure perspective we do we
i think we all know that the the the key
[SPEAKER_06]: from cannabis is cbd you know hands down
can have a dive all time specifically yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: and so maybe yeah so maybe nick would be
able to tell you more more about it than i
[SPEAKER_06]: would from from a therapeutic perspective
i just i just know from a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective what's that go ahead well i
have a little item wait i was just
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about the moment when i i believe
you've worked with ida foo uh in the
[SPEAKER_05]: seizure disorder population down there i
there was a period of time when we first
[SPEAKER_05]: had been and when harley sue showed up you
know it changed everything the efficacy
[SPEAKER_05]: went off the chart a lot of the kids that
were not receiving benefit from acdc were
[SPEAKER_05]: suddenly having you know remarkable
outcomes harley sue is a turpinoline
[SPEAKER_05]: dominant uh type three plant and obviously
early maturing beautiful flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkable floral intensity in addition to
the turpinoline intensity um a very
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated aroma profile there was always
speculation that that was contributing
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the element but the other notion
was that that was the first type three
[SPEAKER_05]: plant i ever saw in an analytical testing
result with cbdv it had a small quantity
[SPEAKER_05]: and then i i've seen that uh sort of
substantiated that the cbdv contribution
[SPEAKER_05]: had really probably helped boost that one
of the things i think about in the sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: like work that i'm really excited to hear
nick talk more about is as we move towards
[SPEAKER_05]: whole metabolome kind of analysis as we
really talk comprehensively about you know
[SPEAKER_05]: all of these analytes i think the reality
is when you have like about a thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: bioactive compounds interacting in
constellations that are you know so vastly
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated it's going to be lifetimes
before we can tease out all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: variables from the therapeutic effect
basis and and i actually i have just one
[SPEAKER_05]: small idea i'd like to contribute which is
the effect matrix you know i'm still
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing companies who are trying to
leverage language like what max is
[SPEAKER_05]: introducing uh in a sort of early effort
and marketing that may in many cases sound
[SPEAKER_05]: actually a little bit like deceiving in
the sense of being comprehensive or full
[SPEAKER_05]: on and to be specific companies that are
the most owners the ones that are making
[SPEAKER_05]: products that say this one makes you feel
sleepy this one makes you feel sexy this
[SPEAKER_05]: one makes you feel stimulated whatever
it's this this is really clouding the
[SPEAKER_05]: airwaves you know in in this like here we
are at the advent of a new era of
[SPEAKER_05]: unbelievable chemoscape diversity and the
possibility of a lot more personalized
[SPEAKER_05]: effects and broad range of therapeutic
efficacy but now we have this massive
[SPEAKER_05]: voice from the industry coming in says no
it's much more simple it's just these few
[SPEAKER_05]: archetypes and it's like here's the thing
that moves units that speaks to consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: where they're at and this whole bullshit
and i'm just like so excited to get to
[SPEAKER_05]: that next level of consequence where we
can deal with the effect matrix in a more
[SPEAKER_05]: sophisticated way which deals with
endocannabinoid system tone which is
[SPEAKER_05]: genetically influenced by diet and and
then we have the of course phytochemical
[SPEAKER_05]: entoria and then we have mindset and
setting but of all these and deliveries
[SPEAKER_05]: have to be added in don't do most
important in terms of the overall diverse
[SPEAKER_05]: analyze on the path they like home
metabolism research i gosh i think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: all about titration and observation and
journaling and also counseling it's about
[SPEAKER_05]: having a relationship in that therapeutic
practice and i'm just so excited to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: with you more about that but why don't you
say a few things there jeremy that's a i
[SPEAKER_07]: think that's a really good um series of
insights it's my mic better guys you sound
[SPEAKER_07]: great okay it was pretty echoey earlier um
the um you're just talking about like uh
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of the integrative approach um by
linking uh therapy as well as you know
[SPEAKER_07]: close personal observation and um then
sharing that with uh providers or care
[SPEAKER_07]: providers that's a huge shift in in how
therapeutics are going now it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: experimental therapies that are using not
only cannabis but also some of the more
[SPEAKER_07]: psychedelics like ketamine and or
psilocybin um are really going down this
[SPEAKER_07]: whole person approach to dealing with very
complex uh mental health issues and or
[SPEAKER_07]: physiological issues um and uh and i can
name some of the groups i mean there's the
[SPEAKER_07]: maps institute that's doing all the all
the work for psychedelic research they
[SPEAKER_07]: just secured a ton of funding but also the
aims institute in seattle is one that i i
[SPEAKER_07]: work with and they're really really good
dr sunil agarwal and dr jan giles and dr
[SPEAKER_07]: grohl and everybody else who works there
is working really really closely with um
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and uh medical cannabis
specifically and they don't just give you
[SPEAKER_07]: a card and send you on your way you have
to participate in the journaling with aus
[SPEAKER_07]: mind and go through this whole process to
really figure out what works for you and
[SPEAKER_07]: um what max is talking about i think it's
really interesting uh one of the things
[SPEAKER_07]: that we have run into in the past is uh
the when you have enough of a sample size
[SPEAKER_07]: you start to realize that the effect
matrix is far less dependent on the chemo
[SPEAKER_07]: type of cannabis but is maybe a feeling
that's stimulating and or relaxing at the
[SPEAKER_07]: same source or i guess i guess anxiolytic
but it's the same time stimulating for
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody might induce paranoia and stress
in another um and that's that's much more
[SPEAKER_07]: of a a body issue than than about than
sort of the the chemo type issue as you
[SPEAKER_07]: would say um and uh yeah sorry about that
so i should probably introduce myself uh
[SPEAKER_07]: thanks marcus so um i have invited here
but also to be sort of upfront about it um
[SPEAKER_07]: i kind of sidled into it mostly by working
on um i start out in in beer and in hop
[SPEAKER_07]: research and so i have been uh working on
things that that max talked about in
[SPEAKER_07]: different different arenas a lot of
sensory science and a lot of um flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis and development and and modeling
of very complex systems and the
[SPEAKER_07]: interactions with people so how um a the
the moiety of what happens in fermentation
[SPEAKER_07]: in beer and when you dry hop and add all
those flavors how those things change and
[SPEAKER_07]: how people experience them is obviously a
very big part of of being a brewer um but
[SPEAKER_07]: i've worked in brewing um on and off for
about 20 years um and i recently moved or
[SPEAKER_07]: i guess not recently i guess about three
and a half years ago moved into hop
[SPEAKER_07]: research and um as many people will know
hops and and cannabis are the two closest
[SPEAKER_07]: relatives of each other um in in the
brewing world we we laughingly discuss in
[SPEAKER_07]: hushed tones enjoying the cousin um it's
sort of a running joke um and jeremy can
[SPEAKER_07]: probably talk there's a couple podcasts
that i that i used to to run with the just
[SPEAKER_07]: another brewing network uh that we talked
a lot about a lot of this in detail um but
[SPEAKER_07]: really the thrust of of my work for the
last uh five or so years has been trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to figure out what the relationship
between the chemicals and the compounds in
[SPEAKER_07]: hops and what how that translates into
sensory perspectives and one of the things
[SPEAKER_07]: that we actually i'm marcus can i share my
screen for a second i've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_10]: slides to show you all if that's okay yeah
let me see if it's set up so that you can
[SPEAKER_10]: it should let me go into my advanced oh no
it says only host so now all participants
[SPEAKER_07]: can share who can danger danger yes all
right here let me uh see if i can start
[SPEAKER_07]: this and uh let's see all right here so
one of the where is it there we go let's
[SPEAKER_07]: see here so and i'm just going to okay
does that look can you see the entire or
[SPEAKER_07]: can you see the presenter mode or just the
uh the whole the whole slide good okay so
[SPEAKER_07]: um one of the things to i'm just going to
sort of back up back into this and that um
[SPEAKER_07]: hop character is something that has been
discussed for um realistically hundreds of
[SPEAKER_07]: years but really has only started to
advance and we've sort of you know i have
[SPEAKER_07]: a bit of reputation as a as a disruptor i
tend to make people's lives a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult than they have to be by asking
the wrong questions at the right time i
[SPEAKER_07]: think um so uh we came into two hops um
and there was this paradigm and i mean if
[SPEAKER_07]: you if you all enjoy craft beer you
probably understand this um from way back
[SPEAKER_07]: when when the germans dominated the hop
market and there were only there was only
[SPEAKER_07]: one thing they were worried about really
and that was bitterness character and then
[SPEAKER_07]: they started thinking about um aromatics
and they were talking about you know noble
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatics versus non-noble so that was
just bittering hops and you had noble hops
[SPEAKER_07]: and noble hops are like sas and hesbruke
and mittelfrue and you know all these
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty um what we would consider now to be
very subtle hops they don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: of of they don't have a lot of punch um if
you compare uh as an example like say a
[SPEAKER_07]: czech saz or early german saz it would be
between two to three percent two to three
[SPEAKER_07]: and a half percent alpha acids and it
might be you know sub i mean it will be
[SPEAKER_07]: well well under one percent by mass total
oil and that's all the although although
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic fractions and hops we talk about
things differently we don't talk about oil
[SPEAKER_07]: we're only talking about the aromatic
fraction um whereas if you look at say uh
[SPEAKER_07]: some more modern varieties like equinot or
uh talus that was just released this year
[SPEAKER_07]: they can be up to four or five percent oil
and you know 18 alpha acids so that's it's
[SPEAKER_07]: like comparing the rocket fuel version of
the hybrid strains would be get from the
[SPEAKER_07]: best growers today like mr plum uh to um
ditch weed that you had to go behind your
[SPEAKER_07]: uncle's house because the hemp farmers let
their seed go into the ditches in kansas
[SPEAKER_07]: in you know 1974 uh so a little bit of a
different in terms of of not only the the
[SPEAKER_07]: potency but the the overall character and
all and so things have changed a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: relatively recently people i mean recently
i mean in in the last 20 years and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: really started the ken grossman in syria
nevada and starting this you know this
[SPEAKER_07]: crazy thing called dry hopping which was
actually invented you know many many many
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago but he was making this amazing
beer called syria and that really for me
[SPEAKER_07]: kicked off the the the craft brewing uh
innovation and it was this shock to the
[SPEAKER_07]: system because people realized that beer
could have different flavors and it could
[SPEAKER_07]: taste floral and fruity and piney and
resinous and all these beautiful beautiful
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatics so they started thinking about
hops in a different way and so if you look
[SPEAKER_07]: at this this um the diagram here on the
right um they tried to i'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: minimize this so you all can see this a
little better um they minimize or sorry
[SPEAKER_07]: they uh they started breaking apart the
aromas in the noble and the floral and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff and started looking at spicy floral
fruity citrus herbal grassy earthy
[SPEAKER_07]: evergreen so on so forth uh you also get
woody in there um and there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: than this but when you look at this if you
look carefully you see that all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: traditional hops are sort of generally in
you know one one quadrant or one side of
[SPEAKER_07]: the of the diagram but then if you look at
all of these superscripts you see it's
[SPEAKER_07]: also flory it's also fruity it's also
citrus and so this two-dimensional
[SPEAKER_07]: approach to classifying hops in terms of a
spider diagram or how much it is just
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't work because they're incredibly
complicated um you have a couple of major
[SPEAKER_07]: fractions you've got the the polyphenol
fraction which is in what i always i
[SPEAKER_07]: jokingly call the planty bits so like the
brach the bracteals the petals the stems
[SPEAKER_07]: so and so forth and this is this all
applies to cannabis and you have you know
[SPEAKER_07]: the flavanols flavinthreols phenolic
carbox acids other other polyphenols and
[SPEAKER_07]: these are very important for the character
of the whole flower but they will not
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily carry through into the final
product unless you have a long steeping
[SPEAKER_07]: time so if you're making a beverage with
hops or cannabis you can get some of these
[SPEAKER_07]: into into solution if however you're
inhaling it this stuff doesn't it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: last it gets it gets broken apart and it
gets destroyed when you talk about the
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatics though you start seeing a huge
amount of variation and and complexity
[SPEAKER_07]: that that starts to really dominate and
describe what the character is so this is
[SPEAKER_07]: a very incomplete list we have identified
over 1400 active compounds in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor active and aromatically active
compounds in hops and the list is growing
[SPEAKER_07]: every year but um one of the things that
has frustrated me for a while is the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry just talks about terps
and terpenes and actually they're not the
[SPEAKER_07]: they are very important but they're not
the end all and be all max mentioned
[SPEAKER_07]: thiols and those are thiols are sulfur
containing compounds in a particular or a
[SPEAKER_07]: particular way but when you talk about
some of the things that are really really
[SPEAKER_07]: important terms for aromatics all of the
diesel II like fuel characteristics and I
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy and I have and I have talked about
this fuel is actually not a single
[SPEAKER_07]: compound it's actually a mix of some
esters there's ethyl acetate in there
[SPEAKER_07]: there's some benzoate some benzene
compounds in there there's some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: methyl butyl characteristics but it also
works with the pentane thioates and for
[SPEAKER_07]: the other hexane anyway it's not just
thiols but thioates and thio esters so
[SPEAKER_07]: thiols are some of the things that lead to
these tropical fruit characteristics and
[SPEAKER_07]: we've identified some compounds in our
hops that you take two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two hops that on the surface have the
almost identical terpene profile so they
[SPEAKER_07]: have the same level of mercine which is
going to be about 65 percent of the total
[SPEAKER_07]: hop oil you've got limonene, linalool,
geraniol, humulene, karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_07]: and farnesine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Farnesine is actually kind of rare but
those all those those those we call them
[SPEAKER_07]: the big seven but those big seven together
are about 97 to 99 percent by mass of the
[SPEAKER_07]: hop oil fraction of the aromatic fraction
however if you have two hops that are that
[SPEAKER_07]: that are identical on that on that sort of
traditional profile and then you run them
[SPEAKER_07]: through a more detailed analysis using
some really fun tools like a gas
[SPEAKER_07]: chromatograph with a quantified time of
flight mass spectrometry and sulfur
[SPEAKER_07]: chemiluminescence you can start finding
these other compounds these other peaks
[SPEAKER_07]: that are not labeled in the industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We found one that was a differentiator
between a hop called sabro and a hop
[SPEAKER_07]: called mosaic and anybody in the industry
would tell you those two things smell very
[SPEAKER_07]: very differently but when we did the
analysis the big seven were you know for
[SPEAKER_07]: for all intents and purposes the same but
they smelled completely different.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one peak that we found that was really
really responsible for the difference in
[SPEAKER_07]: these things because they smell completely
different was at 0.0001 parts per
[SPEAKER_07]: trillion.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not even talking about percent we're
not even talking about parts per million
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not talking about parts per billion
we're talking about parts per quadrillion
[SPEAKER_07]: so it's tiny fractions that make this huge
difference in how you experience the aroma
[SPEAKER_07]: of of the hop and that to me is really
exciting because nobody else was really
[SPEAKER_07]: looked nobody else bothered because they
figured it can't it can't be that
[SPEAKER_07]: important but as as Max will probably tell
you and a lot of you know is that very
[SPEAKER_07]: small tweaks to to the chemical balance
makes things smell and taste very very
[SPEAKER_07]: different so it's really exciting and
we're we're really excited to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: start digging into this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is that our industry in terms
of hops and I see this as well in cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: has a lot of baggage in terms of how
people talk about things so there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of the traditional ways of discussing
flavors and aromatics and what ends up
[SPEAKER_07]: happening is that people try to fit what
they're experiencing into pre-made boxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the Ikea version of decorating
an apartment it's cheap and easy but not
[SPEAKER_07]: always the best thing for for for your
comfort and quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we've had to do is build and I've
been very very lucky and very feel very
[SPEAKER_07]: privileged by by the board and the company
giving me the resources and allowing me to
[SPEAKER_07]: build a team to create a system where we
basically characterize our hops using
[SPEAKER_07]: sensory and create a sensory lexicon that
we all agree to use and this is very very
[SPEAKER_07]: important so when we discuss things like
citrusy or woody or musty those are pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: broad strokes and they depend very much on
your personal experience of those terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example if I say citrusy my
experience is going to be different from
[SPEAKER_07]: from Rick's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rick you live in Florida correct?
[SPEAKER_13]: Me I'm living in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh you live in Amsterdam okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely citrus got you I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So someone definitely be different someone
from Florida or Georgia is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: experience is when you say citrus they're
probably going to go straight to orange
[SPEAKER_07]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_07]: You talk to somebody who is in the Amalfi
coast of Italy or in northern Spain they
[SPEAKER_07]: might start thinking about lemons you talk
to somebody in the Philippines they're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to think calamansi or calamandini.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think if you're in Japan they're
going to go yuzu and yes those are all
[SPEAKER_07]: citrusy but they are very very distinct
aromatics and flavors and they all share a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of overlap but there's very distinct
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we start talking about sensory
descriptions we need to agree on a term
[SPEAKER_07]: and say okay even though when you smell
this this evokes memories of pancit with
[SPEAKER_07]: calamansi in the Philippines because you
grew up there like I did we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: use this one term to call it that and so
you have to convert your brain and
[SPEAKER_07]: remember what you're smelling and so that
we're all using the same term and then we
[SPEAKER_07]: can assign a number to it to its intensity
and its duration and so on so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Creating a shared lexicon is is the first
thing you need to do for for a good
[SPEAKER_07]: sensory program.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you can start looking at taking notes
on it and adding to that so when I say
[SPEAKER_07]: it's citrusy but I detect notes of
tangerine mandarin and naval oranges as
[SPEAKER_07]: opposed to say yuzu or grapefruit or what
have you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can you can add qualifiers to it and
basically increase the resolution of your
[SPEAKER_07]: data.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it with citrus a lot that sometimes
it'll be like fresh citrus or like an
[SPEAKER_07]: older citrus yeah so I call it peel yeah
and then you get dried dried citrus peel
[SPEAKER_07]: like a curacao orange which is to me
tastes like like like you know the
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful sour pez I love that stuff yeah
yeah or a grapefruit for example if you if
[SPEAKER_07]: you break down the aroma of a grapefruit
it is holistically it's grapefruit but it
[SPEAKER_07]: has notes of Sauvignon Blanc it has notes
of lychee and it has black pepper in it so
[SPEAKER_07]: if you if you if you when you get really
experienced in sensory I find it fun like
[SPEAKER_07]: well I find it fun a lot of my housemates
my wife now all think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: obnoxious because I'm always just
deconstructing smells but it's really fun
[SPEAKER_07]: like I remember we got this we got this we
had a you know bread and cheese night or
[SPEAKER_07]: meat and cheese night a couple a couple of
months ago and there was this one she's
[SPEAKER_07]: had this really distinctive characteristic
and she was like what is it it's it's like
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of musty but it's not bad I was like
oh yeah that's that's concrete cellar and
[SPEAKER_07]: she was like how the hell do you do that
like well that's my job you know like it
[SPEAKER_07]: smells like a concrete cellar that's where
it was aged in anyway I digress a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit here so once you've got the shared
lexicon you can start I call it you know
[SPEAKER_07]: integerizing or enumerating but you can
turn terms into numbers and that way what
[SPEAKER_07]: you can do is you can measure the
intensity you can measure the
[SPEAKER_07]: repeatability you can measure just
basically you can see the difference
[SPEAKER_07]: between between samples and at the same
time it's very important to not ignore the
[SPEAKER_07]: holistic approach which is you know this
smells like this and I get this impression
[SPEAKER_07]: and it makes me feel this way that's
hugely important particularly in cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: but then once you have numbers on it you
can also take lab data and compare it to
[SPEAKER_07]: that and say okay every time it was above
a five this ratio of compounds was present
[SPEAKER_07]: or these present these compounds were
present in these quantities and so a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people say like we want to move away
from from just hardcore lab numbers or we
[SPEAKER_07]: want to go full sensory one of the things
that I've realized in my career is that
[SPEAKER_07]: neither is the right way to do it you have
to do both because to really understand
[SPEAKER_07]: the differences between hops or between
cannabis strains or more importantly not
[SPEAKER_07]: even just strains but lots and this is
where I'm going to get back to some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that Matt was saying earlier that
you'll see there's a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: intra strain or intra cultivar variability
and that's something that people need to
[SPEAKER_07]: realize because cannabis and hops or
cannabis more so than hops because
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is an annual hops is a perennial
exhibits a extremely strong g by e or
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics by environment response and so
depending on how it's grown depending on
[SPEAKER_07]: what stressors are there depending on
what's around the environment a the same a
[SPEAKER_07]: clone from from one mother will have a
serious potential for smelling and tasting
[SPEAKER_07]: completely different and then probably
having different psychotropic effects and
[SPEAKER_07]: so it's really important to to be able to
try to measure that and and identify that
[SPEAKER_07]: so we look at I'm just going to go back
through this list here is like we look at
[SPEAKER_07]: characterizing our hops by using sensory
and using lab data at the same time so we
[SPEAKER_07]: take the hops we smell them goes into the
lab it then we run them through an ODP
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a it's a basically olfactory port
where you can smell it as it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: the GC so you can actually smell and write
down what you smell while the GC is
[SPEAKER_07]: pulling out the peaks which is I think is
a really fun and cool tool it's it's you
[SPEAKER_07]: can only do it about once a day because
it's pretty intensive like you know 60
[SPEAKER_07]: minutes of just sitting there sniffing
really intently and you got to do it fast
[SPEAKER_07]: but you start to build up things and we've
discovered things by using this technique
[SPEAKER_07]: that like we figured out what the peach
ester is and that makes that makes hops
[SPEAKER_07]: smell peachy and we it was a a peak that
did not show up on our regular GC so we
[SPEAKER_07]: had to run it through the Qtalk to be able
to figure out what it was but it's anyway
[SPEAKER_07]: that's that's fun but what this does is it
allows you to start seeing which compounds
[SPEAKER_07]: are responsible for which aromas on their
own but then also what other compounds are
[SPEAKER_07]: showing up at the same time that mix and
interact with your senesome and your and
[SPEAKER_07]: those other compounds to give you a
specific character so one of the things
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've we've realized recently is that
three mercapto hexanol it's a thiol it is
[SPEAKER_07]: very very flavor inactive on its own
however when you combine it in the right
[SPEAKER_07]: ratio with geraniol linalool and some
other compounds it can give you this
[SPEAKER_07]: incredible burst of tropical fruit flavor
in a different ratio though it can give
[SPEAKER_07]: you grapefruit which is really interesting
so a two to three ratio uh i i forget what
[SPEAKER_07]: which which order it is will give you a
suavignon blanc lychee character whereas a
[SPEAKER_07]: three to two ratio will give you
grapefruit and that's really interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: to me because it's not just the parts
because the whole is greater than the sum
[SPEAKER_07]: of them and it also depends very much on
how it works with with your with your um
[SPEAKER_07]: with your experience and your your sensory
skills and and how good your nose is then
[SPEAKER_07]: there's the other part of it which is that
people are blind they get something called
[SPEAKER_07]: anosmia where you just don't detect it so
um i am for example i'm extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: sensitive to to certain aromatics um in
the beer world it's diacetyl i'm known for
[SPEAKER_07]: this it's obnoxious because i tend to pick
it up when other people don't even realize
[SPEAKER_07]: it's there and i hate it um on the other
hand i cannot smell this uh there's this
[SPEAKER_07]: cooked onion characteristic and it's you
know it's like fried fried onions um and
[SPEAKER_07]: or caramelized onions and to some people
and that it is uh it's it's a combination
[SPEAKER_07]: of a couple different things a thioate uh
a thiol and then i think an aliphatic
[SPEAKER_07]: alcohol um i can't detect it in beer and
it's like oh this is a pleasantly rounded
[SPEAKER_07]: beer other people are spitting it out
saying this is disgusting how can you
[SPEAKER_07]: drink that and like well good for me um
but it's really important to realize that
[SPEAKER_07]: people have different um blindnesses and
sensitivities and so figuring out what
[SPEAKER_07]: individuals sensitivities and blindnesses
are is very very important when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: running a sensory program so you need to
be able to um have correction factors so
[SPEAKER_07]: if i say oh my god this is the worst straw
smelling diacetyl beer ever probably take
[SPEAKER_07]: that with a grain of salt and compare it
against how sensitive i was what's my
[SPEAKER_07]: threshold for diacetyl um whereas one of
the one of the guys i work with if to
[SPEAKER_07]: tommy detects dms because he's so
insensitive to it and that's a dms is the
[SPEAKER_07]: um uh fritos uh or uh sort of cooked cream
corn uh smell or or or cabbagey smell um
[SPEAKER_07]: if he detects it it's probably very very
strong because he's very not sensitive to
[SPEAKER_07]: it um anyway that's it's very useful to to
bear in mind that your panelists and your
[SPEAKER_07]: sensory people um will have their own uh
innate biases either from experience or
[SPEAKER_07]: just because of they have they have a
different anosmias and different
[SPEAKER_07]: sensitivities um there are compounds that
work together uh to create a elevated
[SPEAKER_07]: sensory experience on a higher level of
smell or a different smell uh and there
[SPEAKER_07]: are compounds that will work against each
other so they will either mute each other
[SPEAKER_07]: or cancel each other out or in the wrong
combination will smell pretty disgusting
[SPEAKER_07]: so you can get uh one of my favorite
examples is ethylbutyrate um it's an ester
[SPEAKER_07]: um it at the right level it smells like
beautiful tropical fruit however once you
[SPEAKER_07]: get over a certain level start to smell
like baby vomit and rotting fruit so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: a really delicate delicate balance um so
one of the things that that i've been
[SPEAKER_07]: working on with my team and i'm you know
incredibly grateful for the people that
[SPEAKER_07]: that that work with me um i've got this
amazing organic chemist and i've got this
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing sensory head and sensory team um
we're really trying to make sure that um
[SPEAKER_07]: we're capturing everything that makes up a
hop uh and then also try to capture how
[SPEAKER_07]: people experience that and then trying to
figure out what the numbers are what are
[SPEAKER_07]: the what are the actual compounds what are
going on and how those interact together
[SPEAKER_07]: to be able to provide this sensory
experience um it's a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: work um but it's really really powerful in
terms of of what it's going to be allow us
[SPEAKER_07]: to to to do to describe these things and
these are the same compounds that are in
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis um hops and they have the same
hops genome is contained within the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis genome which is fun um so we know
that those genes are going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: expressing uh and and they can lead to the
same things um and so the exciting thing
[SPEAKER_07]: for me is that there's a lot of
cross-applicability of this um but one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the things that that uh so max one of the
things that you were saying earlier that
[SPEAKER_07]: that i kind of was uh was interesting um
but also a little concerned about is the
[SPEAKER_07]: the the industry's focus on potency which
i think we all agree is is not what we
[SPEAKER_07]: really want to focus on um but it's also
[SPEAKER_07]: the sample size for the effects of these
compounds so um when you talk about the
[SPEAKER_07]: experiential uh the the the nerves and
stuff like that i don't i don't know
[SPEAKER_07]: anything about the human physiology of it
but i do know how a lot of these aromatics
[SPEAKER_07]: work together to give a um aromatic
experience to the consumer and i don't
[SPEAKER_07]: know i don't i haven't seen enough data on
on what the impact of those compounds are
[SPEAKER_07]: for like sort of pharmacokinetically or or
or uh psychosomatically or not
[SPEAKER_07]: psychosomatically looking for um just the
the psychotropic effects of these things
[SPEAKER_07]: or the or the therapeutic effects of these
of these compounds um so i can't speak to
[SPEAKER_07]: that but i do know from our experience
that there's an incredible amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: individual variety and and difference
between people for the same same mix of
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds and so that's a um it's
something that i think with it as an
[SPEAKER_07]: industry we should uh really try to focus
on to make sure that we are um making
[SPEAKER_07]: sensible recommendations but also to
accept the fact that that people have
[SPEAKER_07]: different experiences of these and i think
it's exciting rather so again you know
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than this be a problem let's use it
as a feature so one of the things that
[SPEAKER_07]: allowed our our group to to be one of the
leading um sort of hop sensory groups and
[SPEAKER_07]: hop providers in the industry was that we
celebrated the variety between lots rather
[SPEAKER_07]: than trying to blend them all together and
make you know one true to type uh citra or
[SPEAKER_07]: true type mosaic or one one type of one
lot of hops out of all of them so there
[SPEAKER_07]: was an average um we actually kept them
separate and keep them separate and allow
[SPEAKER_07]: brewers to pick and choose what they want
because there's beauty in the variety
[SPEAKER_07]: there's beauty in the difference like
celebrate the differences between things
[SPEAKER_07]: um at the same time we also have to be
aware that in terms of quality and for for
[SPEAKER_07]: customer expectations that we do need to
establish what you call typicity and we
[SPEAKER_07]: call this true to type character so it's
like okay this is an amazing lot of citra
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's got 50 more oil than normal it's
way less bitter than normal and it smells
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly citrusy but it's so much it's a
spike so much in one direction
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatically that we don't feel that it's
a good representation of of this hop now
[SPEAKER_07]: what's really fun as i have now have a
field study program where we could say
[SPEAKER_07]: okay what the hell happened in that field
because that's really cool and we can
[SPEAKER_07]: start to figure out sort of what's going
on the metabolome what's going on to the
[SPEAKER_07]: to the impacts from the environment and
farm practice to create those differences
[SPEAKER_07]: and we like to share we give that back to
our to our growers so that they can decide
[SPEAKER_06]: whether they want to do that again um so i
so do you mind if i come no no please um
[SPEAKER_06]: so when i was giving the glorified example
of uh the cannabis sommelier by describing
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis types with an appellation of all
these things um and i think jeremy got
[SPEAKER_06]: concerned by by that from a medical
patient perspective um i just want to you
[SPEAKER_06]: know be very clear that um we really have
to compartmentalize how massive and how
[SPEAKER_06]: vast the cannabis industry is and how
they're so many different things and
[SPEAKER_06]: levels that we can and are talking about
which all have crossover what i was
[SPEAKER_06]: describing in that sense was something
that can truly help the family farmers who
[SPEAKER_06]: practice agroforestry and uh regenerative
cannabis and are being threatened by big
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana and it's their ability to prove
how either cannabis is special in very
[SPEAKER_06]: real ways similarly to viniculture whereas
where i live in colorado right here right
[SPEAKER_06]: now there's no such thing as a cannabis
appellation and there's no way in hell you
[SPEAKER_06]: could even attempt cannabis because in the
state of colorado you have to grow all of
[SPEAKER_06]: your flowers indoor by law it is against
the law to grow cannabis outside in
[SPEAKER_06]: colorado both retail and and uh medical
the only cannabis you can legally grow
[SPEAKER_06]: outside is uh hemp and that even goes for
medical marijuana patients themselves and
[SPEAKER_06]: now because i don't care too much about
the law and i believe that my cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: grows way better outside than it would
inside i grow my weed outside but um it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not lawful and so you don't have that here
and so um the other thing that we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have is the system of taking care of
patients in such a legitimate and caring
[SPEAKER_06]: way that jeremy described well that
doesn't exist it's starting to though it
[SPEAKER_06]: is it is starting okay okay okay when all
i'm saying is is you know in in california
[SPEAKER_06]: what jeremy described sound like aunt
zelda in her work if i had a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: patient a family member i would want them
to not get advice from a budtender in any
[SPEAKER_06]: just regular old dispensary i would want
them in a program like what you're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about because that's what they need people
do need cannabis coaches to explain how
[SPEAKER_06]: vast and complex this stuff is for them
and the reality is because uh being a
[SPEAKER_06]: budtender does not require in most places
training or certification you have stoners
[SPEAKER_06]: who are passionate about getting high in
the position of a pharmacist helping
[SPEAKER_06]: medical patients select their cannabis as
the majority of the situation so yes of
[SPEAKER_06]: course what jeremy's talking about what
aunt zelda does it does exist but on such
[SPEAKER_06]: a small small scale that how can i help
the masses better understand the
[SPEAKER_06]: complexity of cannabis by overcoming the
strain name dilemma um so i did a little
[SPEAKER_06]: video it's on youtube where i went uh
secret shopping for blue dream in denver
[SPEAKER_06]: colorado and in an hour i bought six
different types of blue dream from four
[SPEAKER_06]: different dispensaries brought them back
to the office and i'm showing you that the
[SPEAKER_06]: inflorescence just the the phenotype alone
you can just see this is not the same
[SPEAKER_06]: flower especially when you smell it and
you're like okay these are two different
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers but we have medical patients
coming in for medicine and what they're
[SPEAKER_06]: being offered is things via strain name
blue dream and they're not getting what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're needing and so patient just just
to finish the only place i went the the
[SPEAKER_06]: interpreting process and methodology is
actually helping patients because moms who
[SPEAKER_06]: have to for cannabis for their kids who
are done listening to untrained and
[SPEAKER_06]: uneducated uncertified blood tenders who
don't know what they're talking about can
[SPEAKER_06]: actually engage in their senses the nose
knows what the body needs you are
[SPEAKER_06]: physically attracted your physiology is
attracted to the medicine that you need
[SPEAKER_06]: which is how and why we do teach the
cannabis experimentation phase by helping
[SPEAKER_06]: people first compartmentalize the fact
that there are really stimulating types
[SPEAKER_06]: there really are more sedative types and
there's also a spectrum of types in
[SPEAKER_06]: between those and so if we can help you
understand how to intimately engage your
[SPEAKER_06]: flower even in a dispensary setting where
there's no appellation there's no te wa
[SPEAKER_06]: topicity doesn't even matter you just need
to buy something that's going to work for
[SPEAKER_06]: you we're so proud that interpreting helps
medical patients do that in in that way
[SPEAKER_06]: when they don't have the type of guidance
that you're talking about that i wish
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone truly did have so um i i just
wanted to make sure i just wanted to make
[SPEAKER_06]: that that clear and also say uh nick you
and i have to hang out dude yeah well
[SPEAKER_07]: that's kind of where that's kind of where
i was going with this is that i have a
[SPEAKER_02]: question for you nick sure last one how
many terpenes found in hops oh god um oh
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't know no i mean it's it's well we
haven't identified them all um but but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's are identified is what we're
talking about oh in the hundreds okay
[SPEAKER_02]: because cannabis only has 156 have been
identified that that's it's that have been
[SPEAKER_07]: identified but they also don't have access
to our database um and that that may be
[SPEAKER_07]: something that we can we can change um but
it is uh cannabis will have more than 156
[SPEAKER_02]: i was working with chauvin on rouge and
they were able to find two or three new
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that weren't in the cannabis database
uh they're sent in flavor folks my one
[SPEAKER_02]: other question is what kind of uh analysis
were you doing to identify the headspace
[SPEAKER_07]: of these terpenes in hops so we we we have
a couple of different tools um we have um
[SPEAKER_07]: a pretty sensitive gcms that allows us to
exclude certain sections of the
[SPEAKER_07]: chromatogram so we can zoom in so we don't
get confounding effects from uh very high
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrations of compounds like uh like
mercin it's about 65 percent or 50 to 60
[SPEAKER_07]: percent of the uh actually 50 to 80
percent of the oil profile of hops is
[SPEAKER_07]: mercine um but it's actually not very
relevant for for beer because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: make it through the process so we have to
exclude that and so that gives us a bit
[SPEAKER_07]: more resolution so we can look at the
remaining uh you know 30 to 40 percent are
[SPEAKER_07]: you using gcfid ms we use gcfid ecd for
some of the visceral diketones and then we
[SPEAKER_07]: have some other sensors as well that are
more than fid but yes that's one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: tools that we use i've got using for me we
use speme as well yes so i've got speme
[SPEAKER_07]: fid ecd and then we've got the lc systems
so liquid chromatography systems that we
[SPEAKER_07]: use for the polyphenols and the
cannabinoids um we've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years with cannabis so that's why i was
familiar with these so yeah so so uh we're
[SPEAKER_07]: using the uh agilent uh 73 something or
other um and uh we have the uh it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: speme type system with the gerstel twister
stir bars and uh so it's a it's a sorbent
[SPEAKER_07]: little stir bar that you take the
headspace and then we have a quantified
[SPEAKER_07]: time of flight uh to uh module on that as
well as well as a sulfur chemo
[SPEAKER_07]: luminescence luminescence detector on that
one on that particular one so we can take
[SPEAKER_07]: a look up the uh thiols thiolates you guys
are slightly more sophisticated than my
[SPEAKER_02]: lab was but i've been doing it for 30
years today's flex is brought to you by
[SPEAKER_07]: nick ziegler no it's uh it's it's i do not
intend this to be a flex it's more of a no
[SPEAKER_10]: no i know i know listen it was just that
shit's on another level dude i'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: saying we we appreciate you i have a
question profoundly oh sorry may i very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly make a comment there yeah i just
want to appreciate the range of
[SPEAKER_05]: instrumentation nick just described and
that you know ultimately when we're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at compliance testing or the kinds
of aroma testing that we have in cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: i want to point out the clear distinction
between that level of rigor other than sam
[SPEAKER_05]: what you have been involved with for so
long and others but really quickly i just
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to celebrate nick being here um
this actually comes through a chain of
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations which actually started with
rob clark rob and mojave uh were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: passionately about hops long long time ago
and we started reading all kinds of folks
[SPEAKER_05]: in the hop space and and having these
great conversations and then eventually um
[SPEAKER_05]: there's this amazing man nick who's
showing up in all these podcasts and who
[SPEAKER_05]: has the most informed mind-blowing
absolutely precision oriented sensory at
[SPEAKER_05]: scale and it's just i i want to celebrate
that anybody who hasn't had a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: hear nick and all of the other forums that
he's been airing this kind of content it
[SPEAKER_05]: is just a series of epiphanies and trying
to understand some of the mysteries in the
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma conversation around cannabis um so i
just to me mark has that you've
[SPEAKER_05]: facilitated this today is just such a
awesome deal like i literally think when
[SPEAKER_05]: you bring a nick into our space it's like
the entire space moves in a really healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: uh way much like max and all of the
efforts you've been doing to like really
[SPEAKER_05]: build a rigorous approach to sensory and
then to and i apologize if earlier there's
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a misunderstanding the one thing i
really want to reject and push back on is
[SPEAKER_05]: this we get too codified about particular
effects and the correlation that the scent
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course like even if we're looking
at monoterpenes we know that
[SPEAKER_05]: sesquiterpenes have all kinds of truly
valid therapeutic contributions as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the things that we cannot smell and
so while the nose knows certain things i
[SPEAKER_05]: just think there's a line where we're
talking about therapeutic use and more
[SPEAKER_05]: personalized targeted effects i personally
am concerned about trying to link those at
[SPEAKER_05]: this juncture there's just so much
research and evidence needed to support
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of stuff and i think there's
actually a very simple approach to doing
[SPEAKER_05]: what you just said you know only exists
out here and it's like it can happen
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere cannabis flower exists with the
correct education and meeting patients
[SPEAKER_05]: where they are with the flower that's
available there is a process by which to
[SPEAKER_05]: teach somebody about titration and dosage
the different delivery systems a very
[SPEAKER_05]: initial sort of perspective about
evidence-based pharmacology and then sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of really support through just gentle
counseling and many intervals somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: who's cannabis naive a new and lifelong
sustainable relationship with this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that we all love but not everybody has
been able to access and that's one thing i
[SPEAKER_05]: am really passionate about but i will also
say there's a bunch of evidence that's on
[SPEAKER_05]: the horizon right now dr 80 ray is
publishing this year the data from the
[SPEAKER_05]: last two years of cultivation classic
we've talked about this once before but i
[SPEAKER_05]: think one important part of that evidence
is that we see absolutely no correlation
[SPEAKER_05]: whatsoever in what is i believe the most
rigorous at scale study of contemporary
[SPEAKER_05]: products in this market with a lot of
scientists on the back end between
[SPEAKER_05]: specific terpene dominance and effects
which is one thing that you know we we see
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people running with of course i
talked with ethan frequently about these
[SPEAKER_05]: themes he actually has a new bit of
research from johns hopkins last year that
[SPEAKER_05]: was about liming dominance actually
correlating with positive mood inducement
[SPEAKER_05]: and things but in any case it's almost
that i just feel at right now it's enough
[SPEAKER_05]: to simply move into a maturity around
sensory science and the space and that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: massive contribution and just like a
mind-blowing set of implications and as
[SPEAKER_05]: you said max eloquently it's like you know
there's no better way to support the craft
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer that i can find at this moment to
truly differentiate the novel output of
[SPEAKER_05]: something that has like intricate and
nuanced and special sort of aroma
[SPEAKER_05]: contribution and aroma therapeutic
potential but i i'm excited to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: also simultaneously with the kind of rigor
that nick is describing an analytical
[SPEAKER_05]: process and then that correlating with
human health and sort of clinical research
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to advance that other side of the
conversation in a mature way i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: frustrated with the industry at this point
because god it was seven years ago i set
[SPEAKER_05]: up a similar system what you described at
pharma with there was stimulating
[SPEAKER_05]: properties and there was sedative
properties and i tell you i don't buy it
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore i just i've seen too many contrary
examples it's too much individual basis
[SPEAKER_05]: that is involved to be able to extrapolate
in that way despite the elegance of and
[SPEAKER_02]: simplicity of that notion i just jeremy
yes i i would like to say that when we did
[SPEAKER_02]: blind testing double blind testing with 12
subjects they were all pretty much in
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement on what kind of an effect it was
creating we were dosing pure 100 pure thc
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 milligrams with just a spike of a
single mono terpene and uh they they
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody was in agreement but we were
doing it strictly we were not focused on
[SPEAKER_05]: medical at all and i i also we've had
hundreds of judges with lots of flower
[SPEAKER_05]: samples and i think the process you just
described is a way more refined an easy
[SPEAKER_05]: way to look at the effect of a particular
compound but we just looked at the can the
[SPEAKER_05]: products there in the market and gosh it's
just amazing like we see a real incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: scatter plot and the kinds of effects
described however one here's one very
[SPEAKER_05]: important data point the most important
takeaway probably from a human enjoyment
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective when double blinded and you
know going through this sort of random uh
[SPEAKER_05]: experience uh which 80 led for years it
was that actually aroma intensity was the
[SPEAKER_05]: single greatest factor for user enjoyment
and so aroma diversity and aroma intensity
[SPEAKER_05]: must be characterized it's just such a
vital task i'm just truly grateful to
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody working on that and sam god
knows we wouldn't be working on that
[SPEAKER_05]: without you and and also without ethan and
rob and mojave who have postulated some
[SPEAKER_05]: new work also in a recent cannabis
business times article about archetypal
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma therapeutic categories and that i i
truly think i just hope that uh we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: getting to celebrate a bit and the riches
that gets to spill out from an ecosystem
[SPEAKER_05]: with the kind of instrumentation nick has
and the real possibilities for us to
[SPEAKER_05]: really shine light on what we all know to
be like the most precious expressions of
[SPEAKER_05]: this and to not let the commodity pressure
and immature early stage crazy capitalist
[SPEAKER_05]: scaling of the industry you know totally
muddy what is actually you know this like
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing lineage and tradition of craft
output in any case i've said i i love
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis i'm glad to help with it
but recreational is my interest that's
[SPEAKER_02]: close to my heart i want to know how can i
create all the different effects and how
[SPEAKER_06]: can i increase their potency really to be
honest so and jeremy um i i also hope that
[SPEAKER_06]: um or or maybe i'll try to explain it in
this way we do not teach that if you smell
[SPEAKER_06]: this smell it will have this effect we we
did we don't teach that and a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people actually think that we eat that a
large premise of interpreting is that we
[SPEAKER_06]: teach people how to smell for particular
terpene types and then based off of those
[SPEAKER_06]: smells assume what the effect will be
based off of the research based on those
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes and we actually in our in our
book um we explain how and why that
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't work and it can't work that way
and that it's way more complex than that
[SPEAKER_06]: and an idea i want to give you is how
awesome it is that interpreting works for
[SPEAKER_06]: people who actually have anosmia which is
something that nick was talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the inability to smell and so
people who have lost their first cranial
[SPEAKER_06]: nerve and who cannot even smell these
terpenes they're still accurately able to
[SPEAKER_06]: categorize the generality of cannabis and
so in a general sense you know have you
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed that when you have a heavy head
cold that you don't get as high from your
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis no but i have noticed that i
don't get as high for my cannabis if i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: experiencing fear or being cold if it's
snowing outside and i'm smoking a joint it
[SPEAKER_06]: is really hard for me to feel feel that
but um both rob and i found that and many
[SPEAKER_02]: of my friends when i questioned them have
told me that if they have a heavy head
[SPEAKER_02]: cold and they can't really smell the
cannabis they don't get as high i don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know too much about that but um just
finishing this quick example that i wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: to for jeremy you know in general it's
really incredible that there's types of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis that are really dense from a alex
perspective and that for whatever reason
[SPEAKER_06]: these really dense flower types have fewer
pistols in both the amount of them and the
[SPEAKER_06]: length of them so we call it petite
pistolet so these petite inflorescences
[SPEAKER_06]: that are dense that you feel at the
maxillary gland when you smell it you feel
[SPEAKER_06]: the smell here not here and that if you
have the ability to smell without picking
[SPEAKER_06]: out certain terpenes it kind of smells
like leathers or chocolates tobaccos or
[SPEAKER_06]: mushrooms so when you have these deep
dense rich smell tones with these deep
[SPEAKER_06]: dense rich flowers that are really dense
with petite pistolet in general those
[SPEAKER_06]: herbs affect mostly nine out of ten nine
out of ten people generally as a kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sedative stony effect and so quickly max i
hear you that you're connecting physical
[SPEAKER_05]: morphology again to affect in a way that i
personally am uncomfortable with i totally
[SPEAKER_05]: hear you i also wasn't sure if you meant
bracht or calix but i i really do feel
[SPEAKER_05]: that when you start to make this leap
between physical morphology and human
[SPEAKER_05]: clinical perspective there's just this
it's a bridge too far that's literally my
[SPEAKER_05]: pushback if you can illustrate through
incredible evidence and and substantiate
[SPEAKER_05]: that sort of notion at scale that would be
miraculous but i've seen evidence to the
[SPEAKER_05]: contrary and feel like it's it's a mistake
to follow that uh that path there's too
[SPEAKER_05]: much chemical inventory and too many
diverse features in the ecs tone of
[SPEAKER_06]: individuals yeah and i think you know
there's there's parts in here where we
[SPEAKER_06]: actually show and explain how and why this
method um on occasion doesn't work but if
[SPEAKER_06]: we did have the opportunity for uh me to
hang out with nick and you jeremy and
[SPEAKER_06]: actually the rest of you if you guys want
to come to this party i would love to set
[SPEAKER_06]: up the this demonstration where i would
allow you to to connect um the minuteness
[SPEAKER_06]: of an inflorescence pattern that flowers
that have larger spacing just in the cola
[SPEAKER_06]: they're just a little bit more fluffy that
have a little bit longer pistolet and a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit more of it that generally have
citrusy or gassy tones that you generally
[SPEAKER_06]: feel in the higher part of the trigeminal
nerve the olfactory bulb are generally
[SPEAKER_06]: stimulating herb types and for people who
are really lost in cannabis who are going
[SPEAKER_06]: by strain name or lab tests that won't
tell you an effect type or aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: privileged enough to be in a network like
you who can guide patients that it is a
[SPEAKER_06]: system that on a daily basis people from
around the world will they learn it say
[SPEAKER_06]: this changed my life because i now have so
much more control over my ability to shop
[SPEAKER_06]: for what i'm looking for and actually get
it versus going to a dispensary and saying
[SPEAKER_06]: i'm looking for blue dream 23 thc and and
and not getting what they're looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: and so it's it's a fluidity method and i
can understand if you haven't experienced
[SPEAKER_06]: it firsthand if you haven't had an
opportunity to engage it and bear witness
[SPEAKER_06]: to it and actually try it that i could
really see where you're coming from that
[SPEAKER_05]: so max if i may i just it's a funny thing
so you know i'm a cultivator and i've been
[SPEAKER_05]: directing for this last five year period a
facility called proof cultivar i have done
[SPEAKER_05]: a continuous process of cultivar discovery
whenever i'm able to and we just go
[SPEAKER_05]: through tremendous amounts of diversity
here's one of the g times the interactions
[SPEAKER_05]: that i'm fascinated with that kind of
throws a little wrench into this
[SPEAKER_05]: personally if you take say a classic
afghani and you have a room full of that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to see a more likely stable
aroma profile in that room however there
[SPEAKER_05]: is something that's occurring in a kind of
chemical resonance similar to like say
[SPEAKER_05]: root exudates or chemical signaling in the
root zone we have chemical signaling in
[SPEAKER_05]: the aerial tissue and what we're seeing is
if i bring a turpinoline dominant variety
[SPEAKER_05]: into that room of afghani suddenly the
afghanis are starting to express
[SPEAKER_05]: turpinoline recently so the facility has
gone in these waves i've been bringing in
[SPEAKER_05]: plants that have a high amount of linoleum
there's one plant in particular called
[SPEAKER_05]: peppermint agave suddenly linoleum is
showing up in all of these other varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: that are grown adjacent to that variety
this kind of like just that's like one of
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands and thousands in the
transcriptome of the kinds of dynamics
[SPEAKER_05]: driving really exotic and unique
expressions of chemistry and what is a
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent morphological presentation like
i can show you flowers that look very very
[SPEAKER_05]: similar that have an incredible range when
we're looking at analytical r and d
[SPEAKER_05]: results and so it's just again it's that i
i'm uncomfortable with the notion that
[SPEAKER_05]: physical morphology is going to be
substantiated by strong evidence in terms
[SPEAKER_05]: of human effect that is literally there's
almost nothing that could be said short of
[SPEAKER_05]: really strong evidence at this point in my
career after 30 years of cultivation and
[SPEAKER_05]: really using my own efforts to have
sensory very immature early and now
[SPEAKER_05]: thankfully being exposed to people like
you and nick and many others really lauren
[SPEAKER_05]: salazar and new belgium program was hugely
influential these are the people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: now helping to open the door to a mature
valuation but again i just think sensory
[SPEAKER_05]: is its own element which is amazing and
remarkable but that leap is heroic jeremy
[SPEAKER_02]: does the afghan have the synthase to
produce or whatever whatever i forget the
[SPEAKER_02]: compound you said that plants have to
possess the synthase otherwise they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: just make it exactly so clearly they have
that potential but it's so amazing sam i
[SPEAKER_05]: tell you i've grown so many different
kinds of afghanica over my life we all
[SPEAKER_05]: have i'm sure i i have never seen
turpinoline in anything but a tiny tiny
[SPEAKER_05]: amount a tiny titer in in a classic
afghanica we're talking like a really
[SPEAKER_05]: squat compact early maturing heavy
yielding gorgeous plant uh but so clearly
[SPEAKER_05]: the potential in the synthesis is there
but then through chemical signaling is
[SPEAKER_05]: being evoked and obviously a lot of
controls need to be employed to describe
[SPEAKER_05]: that interaction i do not have that data
in place but through observation of our
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical analytical output it's been
remarkable to see varieties i've
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivated for years completely changing
of course i'm also doing a lot of agronomy
[SPEAKER_05]: trials currently at we have a room with
four different kinds of sort of inputs for
[SPEAKER_05]: fertilizer and media we have lots of
different photobiology projects underway
[SPEAKER_05]: you know obviously light spectra and
intensity is actually as large of a
[SPEAKER_05]: variable as any that max something you
said earlier too you know i reject also
[SPEAKER_05]: this notion that terroir is not indoors i
understand if we take the classical french
[SPEAKER_05]: terroir and we're speaking really about
minerality in the kind of media and
[SPEAKER_05]: substrate the plants are growing in and
environmental effects and stress that the
[SPEAKER_05]: environmental effects and stress even uh
and farm practice like noble rot and
[SPEAKER_05]: botrytis is influenced in the progression
of particular aroma at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm absolutely manipulating i have 16
different environments where i can really
[SPEAKER_05]: create different kind of media types
different mineral inputs different biology
[SPEAKER_05]: inputs and different structure as well as
different irrigation practices different
[SPEAKER_05]: vpd uh points different sort of gas
exchange points and overall controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: environment strategy that very much can
evoke a range of g times e and or i like
[SPEAKER_05]: this other word phenotypic plasticity you
know that the cannabis is so remarkably
[SPEAKER_05]: plastic in the sense that these tiny tiny
changes result in significant differences
[SPEAKER_05]: in the chemical inventory um it was really
like almost nine years ago now when i
[SPEAKER_05]: first gave a the exact same cutting to
four growers in portland and this is way
[SPEAKER_05]: before the grow-off and way before i think
these conversations are going on we saw
[SPEAKER_05]: one sample with 28 milligrams per gram of
beta-miracene another with zero the same
[SPEAKER_05]: variety and those are really different
effect types and and they looked i would
[SPEAKER_05]: say morphologically pretty tight similar
to when you see grow-off data you know
[SPEAKER_05]: jake and sam have published images of the
flowers and there's range in that
[SPEAKER_05]: morphology but in terms of the effect type
you would see a far greater range in the
[SPEAKER_05]: chemistry and that's that's still a
fascinating piece to me so you know and i
[SPEAKER_05]: have seen a really just mountains of data
now we have so much chemical analytic data
[SPEAKER_05]: but the problem is we don't have it at the
level that nick does and then we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have mature sensory to sort of connect the
dots there's this giant gap that i think
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys are actually working to make
happen right now and colin you were
[SPEAKER_08]: interrupted earlier brother sorry so i i
just wanted to jump in and just say you
[SPEAKER_08]: know um a lot of the thing you know the
crop steering techniques you're mentioning
[SPEAKER_08]: and the suggested biotransformations of
the targeted you know terpenes that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to either you know you know you're
after so to speak or the the suggested uh
[SPEAKER_08]: influence uh through different varietals
in the same room and environment do you
[SPEAKER_08]: think um you know just in general that a
lot of the controls play a major role just
[SPEAKER_08]: environmentally also i'm finding root zone
temperatures are playing a major role in
[SPEAKER_08]: how expressions are really truly coming
out and that's a that's a an area that
[SPEAKER_08]: that was really kind of just not talked
about for for the longest time in our in
[SPEAKER_08]: our world um but you know going back to
what nick was touching on it's so
[SPEAKER_08]: important to touch on every you know
little bit of of flavor and an intent here
[SPEAKER_08]: um and you know it's i agree with you
germy i think that we're um we've gone
[SPEAKER_08]: really far and to try to try to humanize
all this and we're like yeah we got to put
[SPEAKER_08]: our thumb on that and understand it um but
there are certain things we have to remind
[SPEAKER_08]: ourselves it gets dangerous and and we
have to find great ways to articulate the
[SPEAKER_08]: mass of hexagon and rubies you know that
this actually is and all the different
[SPEAKER_08]: touch points that we you know nick you
know you beautifully said this and and i
[SPEAKER_08]: think you know germy i don't want to go
harping on it again but you eloquently
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of explained how important the
information uh truly is at mass like we we
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about very compartmentalized things
in terms of the flavor and effect and um
[SPEAKER_08]: you know we're in a you know we're in that
that sweet spot where we have people like
[SPEAKER_08]: nick i'm doing similar research as nick
right now and i have been for quite some
[SPEAKER_08]: time so i find his work you know i want to
spend a day with you or a weekend if we
[SPEAKER_08]: can and just talk you know and and um you
know it's it's what i'm trying to say is i
[SPEAKER_08]: think that it's really great that we're
able to talk about these things i think
[SPEAKER_08]: max you have an incredible perspective on
on education um you know germy's got a a
[SPEAKER_08]: different angle and a different eye for
science and and cultivation so i think
[SPEAKER_08]: together you know talking about this
dialogue is really you know what's needed
[SPEAKER_08]: but um you know the the articulation of
all this is really important right now and
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's that's the most important thing
is just laying it on the table so yeah i i
[SPEAKER_08]: really love what you're doing man and i
love what you're doing nick and i love
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone in this room so i think it's it's
just it's exciting you know i i don't get
[SPEAKER_08]: enough of this conversation and and always
thanks to marcus right so uh but i i
[SPEAKER_06]: appreciate that and i appreciate this
really awesome dialogue as well um this is
[SPEAKER_06]: really fantastic um jeremy my analogy for
what you were describing i call it middle
[SPEAKER_06]: school girl syndrome like i don't know why
they all want to be the same but but if
[SPEAKER_06]: you take one uh you know new girl she goes
to a new school right so you just take one
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivar type and put her in a room full
of other cultivar types how and why they
[SPEAKER_06]: seem to assimilate and try to strive to be
like each other and share each other's
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristics is a very real and true
bizarre fantastic and complex cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that deserves uh celebration right
it's not it's not it's not it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted the cannabis at all so it
happens in bacteria it's called quorum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing and quorum sensing is now known to
happen in plants as well and so that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that plants can basically sense their
environment and why wouldn't they uh sense
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of other phytochemicals
especially when those are the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: attract uh pollinators right and and so um
quorum sensing happens in bacteria it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in yeast happens in cellular
organisms there's no reason to think why
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't happen in plants too and i
think that's that's a manifestation of
[SPEAKER_07]: this is called quorum sensing mark that's
uh that's definitely been proven in in
[SPEAKER_07]: trees particularly old growth forests uh
relatively recently is about within the
[SPEAKER_07]: last five years or so correct um but well
you just you just hit on something i think
[SPEAKER_07]: is really important when we talk about um
the uh the variance and expression of
[SPEAKER_07]: these of these things is that you
mentioned earlier that you know that's all
[SPEAKER_07]: they all have the genes for for these uh
for these terpenes for these these
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds um it's because of the the i put
a link to a paper earlier on about the um
[SPEAKER_07]: uh how the variation the variation is is
actually not reflected in genotype of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis um and what's interesting is that
they do not have deletes they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: missing these genes in fact they i believe
the genome is copied over four times um in
[SPEAKER_07]: in cannabis if that's uh i may be
misspeaking here um but it's it's there's
[SPEAKER_07]: a tremendous amount of of uh sort of
doubling up or tripling up of of these
[SPEAKER_07]: genes so they've been very very conserved
and it's very at that point it's extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult to get rid of them because
they're conserved so many times unless
[SPEAKER_07]: you're doing some sort of editing using
crisper or the recently just discovered
[SPEAKER_07]: retron methodology by harvard um but what
you're talking about earlier about sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: the phytochemical signaling what's really
interesting to me is that we we've seen um
[SPEAKER_07]: i've seen this in cannabis i've also seen
this to some extent in hops um is it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: just the the for for pollinators but
stress response is a huge one so if you
[SPEAKER_07]: see wind damage you typically see a
different uh aromatic profile and
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid profile after that if you get
uh so this this last year gave us some
[SPEAKER_07]: really interesting data from the wildfires
um so all that smoke um and so we we
[SPEAKER_07]: eliminated any sort of deposition from the
smoke but what we saw was that um the thc
[SPEAKER_07]: levels dropped and cd cbd levels the ratio
changed so we were actually able to get
[SPEAKER_07]: you know less destroyed or plants
destroyed uh because of uh non-compliance
[SPEAKER_07]: and hemp um but we did see that there was
a market change and the only difference
[SPEAKER_07]: from from the cultivation from the year
prior because we have all the data on the
[SPEAKER_07]: farm management on irrigation on the water
profile and fertilization fertigation uh
[SPEAKER_07]: par and pp pbfd um i don't have vapor
pressure deficit but that's because we're
[SPEAKER_07]: out they were outdoor um but we saw that
the the wildfires and the the usually the
[SPEAKER_07]: the haze or potential potentially uh any
sort of the air pollutants led to a
[SPEAKER_07]: substantial difference in expression and
we when we did account for any pollution
[SPEAKER_07]: of the of of the smoke on the plants um
we've seen in hops that uh when if a given
[SPEAKER_07]: buying gets attacked by spider mites the
rest of the fields freaks out and it bumps
[SPEAKER_07]: up its beta acid production uh because
they recognize what those are um i really
[SPEAKER_07]: want to see some work on whether or
whether it's insect pheromones themselves
[SPEAKER_07]: uh there's some new startups doing some
really cool work on this uh in the bay
[SPEAKER_07]: area um or if uh like if you see if it's a
stem borer or a piercing or sucking insect
[SPEAKER_07]: that attacks the plant and it's a
physiological response because we see
[SPEAKER_07]: damage we see similar stress responses
from wind damage and some and and hail so
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not great for the crops they don't
look very good but man do they smell
[SPEAKER_07]: freaking amazing after that um and so
what's interesting is is whether it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: physical response or uh a simple you know
phytochemical signaling response i think
[SPEAKER_02]: would be really interesting um nick are
are hops wind pollinated or insect
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated uh they are insect pollinated
oh because kelly's is wind wind pollinated
[SPEAKER_07]: well they can know i mean you can you can
get wind pollination for for hops but
[SPEAKER_07]: they're primarily um i mean so the pollen
gets carried away but the way the hop
[SPEAKER_07]: cones are um all of the uh the bracts and
and all that they cover and the petioles
[SPEAKER_07]: they cover up the glands and they cover up
the pistols those actually don't come out
[SPEAKER_07]: from underneath it so it looks like a pine
cone that hasn't really fully opened yet i
[SPEAKER_06]: i don't i don't know about that i grow a
wide variety of hops i grow a ton of
[SPEAKER_06]: tobacco i also specialize in psychedelic
and psychoactive cacti types have hundreds
[SPEAKER_06]: of them yeah yeah um that's for cactus i
mean yeah i don't know if you can see what
[SPEAKER_06]: we got going on over here but all sorts of
stuff but um lots of poison path herbs and
[SPEAKER_06]: here's the deal like um i got little
videos on my instagram uh not trichome
[SPEAKER_06]: instagram institute instagram max montrose
instagram where i show you the flowering
[SPEAKER_06]: structures of my cannabis plants growing
next to my hop plants and when that
[SPEAKER_06]: pistolet is receiving pollen it does so in
in an anemophly way because they are wind
[SPEAKER_06]: pollinated and you know that because the
male hop plant uh they are diocese um its
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers open up downward the same way
cannabis does and that's to dump pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: from the wind down onto the pistolet
especially allowing the wind to blow it
[SPEAKER_06]: off um and and generally like when i've
grown my hops there's no cone when it's
[SPEAKER_06]: receiving pollen it looks identical to
cannabis in the sense that okay yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a that's a that's a fair point you
are completely correct i misspoke on that
[SPEAKER_07]: um we do we do have some there are some
pollinators but you're right from that
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective it is it is primarily wind
pollinated um the other reason you would
[SPEAKER_06]: also know that it's not a wind uh that why
it is a wind pollinated species um is
[SPEAKER_06]: because both cannabis and hops from a
flower perspective the reason why they
[SPEAKER_06]: don't grow petals why they're not colorful
is because they're not attracting birds or
[SPEAKER_06]: bees from from that level for the sake of
pollination because they are wind
[SPEAKER_06]: pollinators they are they are anemophly
[SPEAKER_06]: um something interesting that you said
jeremy that i think would be a fun
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation is the idea of indoor terroir
um and i think what you are talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: i have to agree with because what you're
talking about is how the environment plays
[SPEAKER_06]: a role on the outcome of the plant well of
course that's going to happen in an indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: or outdoor setting period cheat rock
terpenes no question 's asked right like i
[SPEAKER_06]: think we could agree on that one all right
but is that terroir and i want to jump in
[SPEAKER_06]: on this one i'll let you finish and then
yeah i'll i'll i'm gonna throw one out
[SPEAKER_06]: there and then i expect this to be a a
groovy conversation um so when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: terroir um for example cabernet sauvignon
from the russian river of california
[SPEAKER_06]: sonoma region has a distinctive topicity
so the taste that is of typical from a
[SPEAKER_06]: sonoma cab is due exclusively to its
environment so whatever reason that
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever the mineral content is whatever
the rock content is however that soil is
[SPEAKER_06]: composed that particular region of the
world causes an environmental effect on
[SPEAKER_06]: the outcome of the wine that you can taste
that's distinctive from all other
[SPEAKER_06]: geographies so it's a geographic reason
why the outcome of the flavor from that
[SPEAKER_06]: type of grape tastes different when you
grow the same type of grape somewhere else
[SPEAKER_06]: and there are in the world of wine there
are two types of appellation one is called
[SPEAKER_06]: trips and the other is called lisbon and
the trips agreement to me makes the most
[SPEAKER_06]: sense for cannabis because it's
exclusively based off of describing the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis's quality characteristic and
reputation all of which you can easily
[SPEAKER_06]: describe a particular type from someone's
farm but the lisbon agreement is a quality
[SPEAKER_06]: or characteristic that is due exclusively
and essentially to its geographic origin
[SPEAKER_06]: and so from that perspective um when you
grow grapes outside you have a vintage you
[SPEAKER_06]: have the flavor of the environment that
year and when you grow when you produce um
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol in a warehouse and it's distilled
it's a process that you have indoors that
[SPEAKER_07]: isn't affected by the environment okay i'm
gonna have to jump in here max so that's
[SPEAKER_07]: that's factually incorrect um so uh i'm
gonna i'll go backwards uh through the
[SPEAKER_07]: distillation argument is that um barrel
aging if you're doing barrel aging that's
[SPEAKER_07]: that is tremendously uh impacted by the
local weather and uh it's tremendously
[SPEAKER_07]: impacted by um how the oak that used in
the barrels was grown and where it came
[SPEAKER_07]: from and what sort of stressors what sort
of lignocellulose levels it produced
[SPEAKER_07]: because that'll lead to the amount of of
vanillin that comes out of it and some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the oak lactones so there's there's a
tremendous impact of this and so when i
[SPEAKER_07]: when i when i start criticizing terroir
terroir uh terror terroir uh if i'm going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be american about it uh is i don't um i
do not dispute at all and i completely
[SPEAKER_07]: support and and and uh agree that
environment and geography have a
[SPEAKER_07]: tremendous impact on uh the
characteristics so so the the secondary
[SPEAKER_07]: tertiary metabolite profiles of of these
crops that's not a question um however the
[SPEAKER_07]: classic french opinion of terroir is a
shitty heuristic it's a it's a model that
[SPEAKER_07]: is incomplete and um it's uh from my
perspective with the modern analytical
[SPEAKER_07]: tools that we have it's kind of a lazy
approach it's it's it works but it works
[SPEAKER_07]: and because it ignores so many different
things we can explain it better now um so
[SPEAKER_07]: if you look at when you talk about the the
russian river which you know shout out to
[SPEAKER_07]: vinnie and his crew down there and and all
of the all the lovely wines um that's
[SPEAKER_07]: there's absolutely a difference between
the yacama valley and walla walla cabernet
[SPEAKER_07]: cabernet Sauvignon's from uh from russian
river however is it purely due to the
[SPEAKER_07]: environment the natural environment excuse
me the geography and the meteorological
[SPEAKER_07]: environment that that they're in or might
there be some differences because the
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers in order to get the best yields
and the best character have to grow it in
[SPEAKER_07]: a specific way because of those things so
if you look at bordeaux right as an
[SPEAKER_06]: example it's not exclusively to the
environment it's how the environment and
[SPEAKER_06]: the farmer work together so far is
recognizable yeah the farm management the
[SPEAKER_07]: farm management aspect of it is something
that has been historically ignored and and
[SPEAKER_07]: the the uh sommeliers and winos i mean um
wine geeks uh tend i work with a couple
[SPEAKER_07]: guys we always get into arguments about
this over beer it's great uh but um like
[SPEAKER_07]: if you look at bordeaux for example or
some of the other some of the other
[SPEAKER_07]: classic french reasons there is no
appreciable difference in soil types um in
[SPEAKER_07]: drainage and in that region but there's
tremendous variability between the north
[SPEAKER_07]: end of the south end or how the growers
grow it and uh that's and that's that's
[SPEAKER_07]: what leads to the distinction between
those those things and so what they've
[SPEAKER_07]: done is they've they've basically said of
a if it's from this region you can call it
[SPEAKER_07]: a bordeaux right that's you know so you
know them on us denomination of origin you
[SPEAKER_07]: know whatever doms or however you want to
say it um but they've also established
[SPEAKER_07]: upper limits and lower limits for the
various characteristics that those wines
[SPEAKER_07]: exhibit to to the consumer um they've got
they've been doing it for so long they
[SPEAKER_07]: know they're not going to be well well out
of out of range but there is a range and
[SPEAKER_07]: when we talk about sort of uh cannabis
variation your blue dream example is a
[SPEAKER_07]: fantastic one ignoring for the moment the
fact that it's very likely that people got
[SPEAKER_07]: different sources or different cuts or
different clones or different sources
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds ignoring that even if they were all
from a blue dream mother or something like
[SPEAKER_07]: that we should be working to establish
this true to type this true to type
[SPEAKER_07]: characteristic or this typicity and the
way you do that is you say okay here is
[SPEAKER_07]: the average results or here here are the
results of all the blue dream we could
[SPEAKER_07]: find this is the upper limit for these
terpenes and stuff that we that we
[SPEAKER_07]: discovered this is the lower limit for
these terpenes this is the upper limit for
[SPEAKER_07]: thc and c and the other cannabinoids this
is the lower limit and if it falls within
[SPEAKER_07]: this range within so we typically take
take the the median value or the mean
[SPEAKER_07]: value so it's the it's the it's the really
the median value and then we will go up to
[SPEAKER_07]: two standard deviations outside of that
any more is too far outside of type to be
[SPEAKER_07]: considered that that variety and so we use
that in hops if you were to look at doing
[SPEAKER_07]: that with with cannabis i think that it
could be done similarly or the alternative
[SPEAKER_07]: is you don't worry about that true to type
so here's the blue here's the blue dream
[SPEAKER_07]: core but this is a piney expression of it
this is a citrusy expression of it this is
[SPEAKER_07]: a fruit expression this is a terpenaline
terpenaline and also mean heavy expression
[SPEAKER_07]: of it however you want to do that but i
think it's totally possible for us to
[SPEAKER_07]: create the the error bars or the the upper
limits for that true to type
[SPEAKER_07]: characteristic while also celebrating a
variation within it and like jeremy was
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about end up with the indoor
terroir or farm management based character
[SPEAKER_07]: paths character development for for for
individual cultivars and i think that's
[SPEAKER_06]: not necessarily good sure question yeah so
um and to help help the framework of where
[SPEAKER_06]: i'm coming from so uh using alpenglow
farms which by the way i they're in my
[SPEAKER_06]: book they're in my online course i use
them as the example because i love craig
[SPEAKER_06]: johnson and his family and the way they
grow cannabis i just it's the best um
[SPEAKER_06]: they're so true to the earth they care
about sequestering carbon i mean the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that craig is passionate about his soil
when he touches it and smells it and
[SPEAKER_06]: shares it with you and make sure that
that's the cannabis he's growing in not
[SPEAKER_06]: some fox farm bag of stuff you could get
right so in the sense of viniculture and
[SPEAKER_06]: the sense of growing plants outside think
about that outside in the sun in a region
[SPEAKER_06]: in southern humboldt with a farmer who
understands his terroir and grows towards
[SPEAKER_06]: it when he produces a variety of cannabis
that he came up with called coyote blue
[SPEAKER_06]: and he grows coyote blue in this region in
this way with these environment and keeps
[SPEAKER_06]: that consistency that's the true to true
to strain uh type that i've believed
[SPEAKER_06]: you're talking about and to me that's
cannabis and it's cannabis with an
[SPEAKER_06]: appellation with taiwa with topicity it's
recognizable and it deserves a whole hell
[SPEAKER_06]: of a lot of praise compared to where i
live because if you take a clone of
[SPEAKER_06]: craig's uh coyote blue and you give it to
a standard dispensary operation in the
[SPEAKER_06]: state of colorado they will turn it into a
mother they'll clone it out and maybe this
[SPEAKER_06]: month they'll use a mixture of coco core
with vermiculite and pearlite and all this
[SPEAKER_06]: other stuff and then just feed it
synthetic nutrients and that's it's the
[SPEAKER_06]: same strain right it's it's coyote blue
and coyote blue is being grown in a
[SPEAKER_06]: warehouse and not as an agriculture but as
a commodity and so obviously when you
[SPEAKER_06]: compare the difference of those two
flowers they're gonna be quite different
[SPEAKER_06]: uh but from a taiwa perspective and what
taiwa is and means i believe craig johnson
[SPEAKER_06]: has taiwa and i believe the way he's
growing cannabis is within a taiwa and i
[SPEAKER_06]: think he can express what that taiwa is i
think he can explain it to people um and i
[SPEAKER_06]: think that's what can help make his
cannabis special and preserve what he's
[SPEAKER_06]: doing and keep his family farm strong and
and doing what he's doing whereas the
[SPEAKER_06]: coyote blue that i would get at the
dispensary that's just i mean factory-made
[SPEAKER_06]: warehouse weed in colorado it's hard for
me to say oh yeah that's got a taiwa to it
[SPEAKER_06]: too i'm like no it was grown in a certain
way and that certain way does have an
[SPEAKER_06]: output on it on the final product but is
that what taiwa is it means when taiwa
[SPEAKER_06]: traditionally in the french term and how
it affects viniculture is really
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly based on how the natural
native environment plays a vintage role on
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant types versus some so max i i'm
going to jump here too i love i think
[SPEAKER_05]: you've done a really great service to the
classicist definition of taiwa and this is
[SPEAKER_05]: a really important idea that we have
orbited in the cannabis space for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time and i think you've really done that
idea of service like nick said earlier i
[SPEAKER_05]: do agree that we're at a point where we
have different tools in case capabilities
[SPEAKER_05]: first off i don't want to be cast as i
think warehouse weed is good uh in general
[SPEAKER_05]: i i just want to share with you that i i'm
passionate like actually the very first
[SPEAKER_05]: regenerative farm award was at the
cultivation classic that i've founded and
[SPEAKER_05]: then it went to the emerald cup and i've
been working extensively with jesse dot
[SPEAKER_05]: and others to support the most meaningful
movement and um agriculture and outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: field scale agriculture and really working
with materials in the local region and
[SPEAKER_05]: just have a huge passion for that but i'm
producing 50 well 45 to 50 harvests a year
[SPEAKER_05]: in 16 environments with a huge amount of
diverse variables this is not at all like
[SPEAKER_05]: a warehouse in colorado i'll just share
you know that's a lot of small spaces with
[SPEAKER_05]: different lighting technology different
this facility is awesome my main focus
[SPEAKER_05]: right now is mineral content in the media
i am so fascinated about the mineral
[SPEAKER_05]: balanced media and the correlation to the
development of aroma i i've seen that for
[SPEAKER_04]: example i've been doing organically for a
very very mineral balanced media is is
[SPEAKER_05]: just massive but there have not been
sufficiency targets for the kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals that drive the best product
quality in this space and that's really
[SPEAKER_05]: changing in these last couple of years i'm
sure you know soil doctor bryant is
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely at the vanguard of the
understanding about mineral sufficiency
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis agronomy and has built an
incredible basis of insight that i would
[SPEAKER_05]: say at this point is about the most mature
i've seen in any case working with
[SPEAKER_05]: different kinds of mineral sufficiency
targets inorganic sub with different
[SPEAKER_05]: cultural practices harvest timing light
spectra irrigation frequency all these
[SPEAKER_05]: elements i can produce what is the
equivalent of like that russian river
[SPEAKER_05]: pinot noir and it is is strawberry profile
but in that willamette valley pinot noir
[SPEAKER_05]: is very much a yeah blackberry it's our
cherry also cherry and blackberry kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: both but you know it's just that i can
achieve all of those voices in a
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled environment and but one other
thing i just want to say about controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: environments because we almost can't even
talk about it without recognizing the
[SPEAKER_05]: research that came up from university of
colorado only a month ago that illustrates
[SPEAKER_05]: the unbelievable reckless irresponsibility
of carbon uh in this production
[SPEAKER_05]: environment that we're seeing you know
it's got a greater carbon footprint than
[SPEAKER_04]: coal in colorado for indoor cannabis
production
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know this is a nightmare this is
really on the path to one consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: year-round production environment
completely powered by renewables and i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: hunting for resource use
[SPEAKER_05]: i believe anybody how visualization i
believe that plant factories with
[SPEAKER_05]: artificial lighting driven by renewables
are a very significant part of the mosaic
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to move towards but there's a
little bit of like kind of knee jerk well
[SPEAKER_05]: it's it's not working well now but we're
not at the apex of our evolution just like
[SPEAKER_05]: this sensory conversation but thankfully
we're moving in a way that's progressing
[SPEAKER_05]: there but back to being true to time
what's exciting for me is that i i think
[SPEAKER_05]: that just like the beer brewer can achieve
so many results in a short period of time
[SPEAKER_05]: and therefore have this unbelievable
perversity of aroma and flavor and i
[SPEAKER_05]: always look to the old wine drinkers that
i know who consume alcohol and think god
[SPEAKER_05]: you're missing what's happened in beer
with the novel voices of barrels and
[SPEAKER_05]: barrel-aged ales coming back and all of
the kind of hazies and these wild sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: diverse elements comparing it to a vintner
you know who has a single result a year
[SPEAKER_05]: and in their entire career may produce
like 20 or 30 results at best it's like i
[SPEAKER_05]: just think that we need to be having this
conversation between those polls because i
[SPEAKER_05]: can produce so many results and then
probably discover sooner than later what
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those variables whether minerals
in the media or other cultural practices
[SPEAKER_05]: that can help to contribute to the overall
base of knowledge as we're seeking to
[SPEAKER_05]: optimize ideal expressions of aroma
therapeutic attributes and you know that's
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously a vast pursuit will take tons
and tons of us all talking and wrestling
[SPEAKER_07]: and arguing and having jeremy we call that
job security in the analytical space but
[SPEAKER_07]: what you just mentioned in terms of the
the compounds and the minerality and the
[SPEAKER_07]: the the you know the i call them these
sort of metabolic precursors and so
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at the soil chemistry and the
fertigation profiles for any crop is
[SPEAKER_07]: really fascinating because you can then
apply metabolomics and looking at the
[SPEAKER_07]: genes that are being turned on and turned
off in response to what is present or
[SPEAKER_07]: absent because they will they have
different pathways to produce the same
[SPEAKER_07]: result in case if it's if it's
metabolically valuable plants will
[SPEAKER_07]: synthesize the compound that they need we
do not understand why a lot of these
[SPEAKER_07]: aromatic compounds are synthesized by the
plant they are tertiary metabolites
[SPEAKER_07]: they're not primary metabolites they're
not starch they're not a protein they're
[SPEAKER_07]: not they they have some function because
they're expensive to produce produce some
[SPEAKER_07]: of them are byproducts from other cycles
metabolic cycles or biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_07]: biochemical cycles some of them are seem
to be an end result that is quote-unquote
[SPEAKER_07]: intentional like it's conserved for a
reason i would love to find out more about
[SPEAKER_07]: what compounds or you know what what
mineral profiles what minerals are being
[SPEAKER_07]: used in what manner to lead to the the
synthesis of these of these compounds it's
[SPEAKER_07]: something that i'm working on in hops and
like the like the vintner we only get one
[SPEAKER_07]: harvest a year so it's going to take
that's real job security whereas with with
[SPEAKER_07]: the work that you're doing and the the
recycling and it's just i mean the cycling
[SPEAKER_07]: through these many iterations is is what i
would love to be able to get into more
[SPEAKER_07]: detail with because i have the models
roughly sketched out i have the the the
[SPEAKER_07]: analytical tools i just don't have the
data yet and i would just love to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to collaborate with anybody who's
interested in this on creating a system
[SPEAKER_07]: that if not you know sort of
governmentally regulated but at least you
[SPEAKER_07]: know voluntarily regulated in the industry
so that we can you know we can raise the
[SPEAKER_07]: bar we can we can you know the rate let's
raise let's raise the water level let's
[SPEAKER_07]: float all the boats let's give people
access to data and and and reframe it in a
[SPEAKER_07]: way so that they understand it so they can
make choices that are good for them
[SPEAKER_07]: because of that individual variability and
response so you know what this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: profile this is we call this i'm going to
use the blue dream example again because i
[SPEAKER_07]: think it's a really good one this is blue
dream it can be up to this level or down
[SPEAKER_07]: to this level of these compounds but you
will have a expected level of of response
[SPEAKER_07]: you personally within that range so you
get to pick i want a a turpinoline
[SPEAKER_07]: dominant version of blue dream because i
like the cannabinoid profile the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid profiles are actually pretty
stable interestingly enough that i within
[SPEAKER_07]: a within a within a variety the aromatic
profiles can be all over the place if you
[SPEAKER_07]: grow it using the same inputs if you grow
it in the same way in the same place
[SPEAKER_07]: treating it the same with exposure to the
same stressors or same same deprivation of
[SPEAKER_07]: various nutrients or excess you're going
to have pretty good repeatability not 100
[SPEAKER_07]: but pretty good repeatability there's no
way reason that we as a as a group or as
[SPEAKER_07]: an industry can't come together to try to
voluntarily create this result or you know
[SPEAKER_07]: this this database and this this
information for people i think empowering
[SPEAKER_07]: consumers is is something that i really
believe in as i like people to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: make their own choice nobody knows what's
what's better for them than the individual
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves as you said earlier like you
pick the medication that you are attracted
[SPEAKER_07]: to that or that you're you're drawn to
because it makes you feel better let's
[SPEAKER_07]: let's just be honest that's why we do this
stuff and be it because of aroma or
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid profile and it's for me it's
always both like i would much rather
[SPEAKER_07]: consume something that is aromatically
delicious but maybe less potent in some
[SPEAKER_07]: ways than have the exact perfect balance
of cannabinoids with no character you know
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just that's just not how it works for
me and i and i recognize that i think that
[SPEAKER_07]: there is something there i don't have it
quantified i have not seen the data that
[SPEAKER_07]: does quantify it but there is definitely
an interaction between those things and
[SPEAKER_07]: you max when you were saying earlier like
looking at the at the flower structure i
[SPEAKER_07]: completely agree with jeremy that i think
that's an extremely large leap to make in
[SPEAKER_07]: terms of the pharmacokinetics based on
flower structure however i also think that
[SPEAKER_07]: people looking at a really dense bud might
expect a different level of of response or
[SPEAKER_07]: characteristics from from that so they're
they're they're sort of preempting
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves as a it's a it's the the in
some way it might be you could link it to
[SPEAKER_07]: the placebo effect but it really is is
that there's a there's a bias of
[SPEAKER_07]: expectation towards something when i see a
really dense snug that's really well
[SPEAKER_07]: trimmed and clearly lovingly handled i get
excited by that because i'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's going to be it's high quality
flower in that in that perspective
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult to do with hash unless you can
tell you can actually tell that it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: it's been properly sifted and cleaned and
it's you know it's a really good good mix
[SPEAKER_07]: and it presses well and you can you can
you can enjoy it for me for me hash is far
[SPEAKER_07]: more far less visual and far more you know
on the intake like once i've once i've
[SPEAKER_07]: once i've vaporized it and inhaled it then
i have the experience of it whereas flower
[SPEAKER_07]: i mean like we we in the brewing industry
we say that the the first sip is with your
[SPEAKER_07]: eyes you know so so so physical
representation and on a side note hazy
[SPEAKER_07]: ipas man there can be great flavor wise
they can also be really muddy but i spent
[SPEAKER_07]: you know 18 years of my life trying to
figure out how to make hoppy beer clear
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you know get it all flipped on
its head and everybody wants everything
[SPEAKER_07]: hazy it's the same thing with with flowers
that when when you you know you can get
[SPEAKER_07]: loose airy bud or you can like dr
grinspoon which is actually has a
[SPEAKER_07]: fantastic aromatic and cannabinoid profile
but it's just crappy flower structure or
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting at least then you also end up
with or you can get this like really super
[SPEAKER_07]: dense nugs that because the farmer grew
them that way or the grower grew them that
[SPEAKER_07]: way and and and managed them and really
took care of the trim and the cure it's
[SPEAKER_07]: really like i love that i love that
variability you know or the old mexican
[SPEAKER_07]: brickweed back from from from way back
when but i think it's uh it's it's worth
[SPEAKER_07]: considering those aspects of of how we
interact with what's in front of us and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not just aroma and smell but it is
also visual and and i think it's you know
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're talking about a holistic
assessment of how people react to a crop i
[SPEAKER_07]: think that's that's worth doing so can i
time in just a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective than a lot of people here
welcome debbie hey good to see you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: whoop whoop whoop oh man um so much i want
to say about this but i've learned a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: wow that's trippy that the plants start
taking on the characteristic of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: next to them it makes total sense and that
that goes all through like the human
[SPEAKER_01]: genome the plant genome the planet
probably you know we're all like
[SPEAKER_01]: replicating to this kind of stable place
um and it makes me think like spending all
[SPEAKER_01]: this time listening to the drill down i'm
a retailer i have i've been street level
[SPEAKER_01]: retailing almost 25 years now so i know
the consumer i mean you start talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: this the consumer about this stuff and
their eyes are going to glaze over and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of that rule of three uh is it
the is it a hot mild medium you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the salsa flavor is it small medium
large um that's how the consumer is
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking and and so while we're talking
about capturing the micro language i think
[SPEAKER_01]: we should also talk about capturing the
macro language what are those three
[SPEAKER_01]: categories that are small medium and large
in the industry you know are there three
[SPEAKER_01]: right i put extra large down there too but
i you know i really think that most of my
[SPEAKER_01]: clients are thinking in threes indica
sativa hybrid uh potent mild medium um the
[SPEAKER_01]: sleepy uh hyped up or somewhere in between
so i just want to put my two cents in um
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah what is that uh what's the simplicity
of the macro that the the clients are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for and then when i think about
the micro i think it's super interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because i think that's where the medicine
is and i think that's what we do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: with the micro we really got it we're
trying to cure some diseases right and we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to really get micro to figure out
what's going to really get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: bust that stuff apart so so i love that
idea and then this whole time i've been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about with all these talking
about all these stuff about beer i think
[SPEAKER_01]: about the beer um cooler at the store
which is always so cool but there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: only a couple categories right is it dark
beer is it ipa is it you know they've kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of categorized it and then within there
there's a lot of genius in there but the
[SPEAKER_01]: clients are still going for those take me
to the category that i like that's simple
[SPEAKER_01]: for my brain as a consumer so we are
categorical thinkers so we like to make it
[SPEAKER_06]: easy i would love to i would really love
to answer debbie on this because um this
[SPEAKER_06]: is my bread and butter is educating uh
dispensary staff to teach their consumers
[SPEAKER_06]: what's available to them by getting around
things that are not real and true such as
[SPEAKER_06]: indica or sativa and how do we do that um
because um all of these domesticated
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrids are so vast that they're no longer
an indica or or sativa and when it comes
[SPEAKER_06]: to speciation we're finding that um
anyways like that can get too complex i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: just going to share this with you um a lot
of guys on here are familiar with rob
[SPEAKER_06]: clark's work and i think it was brilliant
when rob clark was compartmentalizing
[SPEAKER_06]: different cannabis types um in acronyms
and so he would say uh blh for broadleaf
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp which would be uh sativa species
subspecies indica variety chinensis it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: broadleaf hemp type and within the broad
to narrow leaf spectrum you have a broad
[SPEAKER_06]: to narrow leaf spectrum within marijuana
types and within hemp types um and what we
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot do for the sake of of jeremy and
reality is you can't distinguish a type
[SPEAKER_06]: based on what it looks like which we do
not do we don't say a a narrow leaf type
[SPEAKER_06]: is going to affect you this way and we
don't say a a bud that is shaped this way
[SPEAKER_06]: will affect you in that way it's truly a
blend and how they kind of characterize
[SPEAKER_06]: each other together which is too complex
to go over right now i'm not going to sit
[SPEAKER_06]: here and teach you the complexity of
interpreting methodology i just wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: let you guys know that that's not what we
do um but what we have done is we've we've
[SPEAKER_06]: gently separated rob clark's work by
instead of calling it a drug type because
[SPEAKER_06]: he was separating a drug type from hemp
types but his work came out the year
[SPEAKER_06]: before hemp had federal legislation that
opened up hemp farming for farming it for
[SPEAKER_06]: drug types and so out here in colorado
people farm hemp specifically for cbd or
[SPEAKER_06]: they farm hemp specifically for cbg and
those are drugs drugs or medicines
[SPEAKER_06]: medicines and drugs are interchangeable
that's why you get medicines for drugs and
[SPEAKER_06]: so you can't call the one that gets you
high a drug compared to hemp that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: farming for drug purposes for a variety of
different reasons and after we learned the
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 year old etymology of the word
marijuana and how and why it is a cool
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful and righteous word not what we
thought it was and where it just comes
[SPEAKER_06]: from from the 1930s perspective that we
really just compartmentalized that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a difference between hemp types and hemp
varieties and marijuana types and in the
[SPEAKER_06]: world of marijuana cannabis we have
broadleaf types so we have broadleaf
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana that we call blm and because
it's not just sedative there's sedative
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's also types that are a little
bit less sedative we just call it blmd
[SPEAKER_06]: broadleaf marijuana dominant medium leaf
marijuana is the type that's kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: that's in between nlmd is narrow leaf
marijuana dominant and then nlm is narrow
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf marijuana and what we found is in
general if you have marijuana types that
[SPEAKER_06]: have very narrow leaves that generally has
a plant shape and that plant shape has
[SPEAKER_06]: longer spaces in between the nodes and
that longer nodal structure allows the
[SPEAKER_06]: colas to grow out a little bit longer and
become a little bit more fluffy and less
[SPEAKER_06]: dense and that plants that look like that
then also depending on the aroma
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective perspective and its chemo type
you can start to compartmentalize that in
[SPEAKER_06]: general and nlm's narrow leaf marijuana
types for the most part are generally
[SPEAKER_06]: stimulating types of cannabis and so
you're not calling it a sativa because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's like you can't really say well
there's a hardcore sativa and a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: less of a sativa so we just respect the
fact that cannabis is on a spectrum of
[SPEAKER_06]: effect type and we just use acronyms to
compartmentalize them and we use acronyms
[SPEAKER_06]: to separate marijuana types from hemp
types as both of those cannabis types have
[SPEAKER_02]: broad to narrow leaf spectrums are you
familiar with the work by carl hilling yes
[SPEAKER_06]: i mean i know quite a i've read his papers
before okay because that's where rob got
[SPEAKER_02]: the narrow leaf and broadly was from carl
interesting i did not know that yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely true carl and rob are very
close friends of mine i think for the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer we can just even drill down
further that they're probably only going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to know six things six factors is
it lightly potent mildly potent super
[SPEAKER_01]: potent does it make me sleepy uh in
between or uh like is it like coffee and
[SPEAKER_01]: and i think those are the consumer
categories i don't know what else they i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean other than that they want to drill
into those particular categories once they
[SPEAKER_06]: find their crossroad but all right so so
debbie's spin the wheel which way do you
[SPEAKER_06]: want it to turn left right and how many
turns do you want no i get it i'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: saying it still is a little bit confusing
but it's kind of putting a big topic on
[SPEAKER_01]: the big picture topic not you know not of
broad interest but the consumer i think is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want something more simplified
they already have something more
[SPEAKER_10]: simplified you make a super good point
debbie actually and and this is you know
[SPEAKER_10]: this is something we're not thinking about
because we go deep down the rabbit hole
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's if you ever stood behind a
dispensary and just made sales all day and
[SPEAKER_10]: if you did it for 25 years the way debbie
did it you would have like a very unique
[SPEAKER_10]: perspective based on the reality of the
customer the end user nothing else and i'm
[SPEAKER_10]: with you max i'm all about like no but
let's like because i'm i geek out on this
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff i want everyone to learn this stuff
but when i also go do my pk sessions at
[SPEAKER_10]: canadian dispensaries for my own company's
products um you know the the people who
[SPEAKER_10]: are working there they they're like oh
yeah i want all this stuff i want to learn
[SPEAKER_10]: all this stuff but in reality when i talk
to them they're like dude i have like 48
[SPEAKER_10]: seconds with each customer sometimes two
and a half minutes they don't want to hear
[SPEAKER_10]: as much of what i've been saying as i as i
thought they might and this is unique go
[SPEAKER_07]: ahead so marcus and debbie you're both 100
correct in this and that's that's
[SPEAKER_07]: something that that what we're going in
the rabbit hole i think that debbie's uh
[SPEAKER_07]: you know let's let's make it simple like
this is generally stimulating or generally
[SPEAKER_07]: sedating this is sort of middle of the
range you know based on the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_07]: profile um i think that it also the one
the other thing the consumers do is like
[SPEAKER_07]: oh i want a diesel smelling one or i want
a citrusy smelling one or i want a you
[SPEAKER_07]: know tropical fruity smelling one um those
i think being able to to to to give those
[SPEAKER_07]: labels is really really important and if
you can assign a simple number like this
[SPEAKER_07]: is you know uh it's a five out of ten
fruity it's a seven out of ten citrusy
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically and so on so forth is is a
really easy way to do it and as you know i
[SPEAKER_07]: was ranting on about how heuristics are a
problem earlier but i i use them all the
[SPEAKER_07]: time and that's how we explain a lot of
things in the hop world and in the beer
[SPEAKER_07]: world and it works for people and like you
said like you know the classifications
[SPEAKER_02]: you've seen the phytopax yes yeah that's
pretty good yeah and so i think i think
[SPEAKER_07]: we're heading towards these directions as
an industry from a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_07]: sides and if we all kind of came together
it's pretty useful it'd be useful for for
[SPEAKER_07]: people to to be able to see these things
and and give them a a simple tool that we
[SPEAKER_07]: could sort of at least anchor the
conversation around and like here in
[SPEAKER_07]: washington for example we have uh the the
move towards the actual like you know the
[SPEAKER_07]: dominant terpene profiles and and all of
the cannabinoids that are that are have
[SPEAKER_07]: been detected depending on the methodology
and forget about lab inter lab variants
[SPEAKER_07]: we've seen um but those are really useful
tools for me personally i'm like oh i love
[SPEAKER_07]: the smell but this one doesn't actually
make me feel that good and to try to
[SPEAKER_07]: understand and sort of arm the consumer
with you know give give the retailers and
[SPEAKER_07]: and the the novice consumer access to
simple categories to discuss these these
[SPEAKER_07]: things and again sort of frame the
conversation but then as they get more
[SPEAKER_07]: interested or they notice specific effects
they might at least have access to
[SPEAKER_07]: information that allows them to drill a
little bit deeper and this like when you
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about uh terms of flower uh you know
all the flower characteristics i think
[SPEAKER_07]: that's that's fantastic but you know this
is a hash church discussion right i mean
[SPEAKER_07]: how does that apply to to hash and an
extra x and that's those are those are
[SPEAKER_07]: increasingly popular methods of
consumption it's actually a sin to to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke marijuana in this church you can
only smoke hashish actually actually in
[SPEAKER_10]: fact in fact no matter what you smoke
you're smoking hashish when you smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: flour you're just smoking hashish diluted
on flour it's been diluted by the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all hashish we don't discriminate
here right off the volcano for example you
[SPEAKER_02]: you put a bud in there and it liberates
the resin heads the trichomes everything
[SPEAKER_10]: else is left alone really it's true what a
great conversation i'm glad uh i was
[SPEAKER_10]: loving how deep we were getting into it
and i just also loved debbie just coming
[SPEAKER_10]: in being like oh hey uh just uh you know
over here in reality uh just had a couple
[SPEAKER_10]: perspectives it was good debbie really it
was thank you i like the idea of really
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the science it's incredible all the
work we can do it's offensive when we
[SPEAKER_01]: think about prohibition and i mean we
maybe could have cured cancer all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that could have happened
with cannabis had we been able to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: research so thank goodness you guys are
doing that and let's keep drilling down
[SPEAKER_01]: and figuring out what these specific
molecular makeups can do to help humans
[SPEAKER_02]: you know so well uh you can lead a
customer to knowledge but you can't make
[SPEAKER_01]: him think i like that a lot of people are
coming into the dispensaries so they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to right they're trying to let go of
all the complication in life so even when
[SPEAKER_01]: i go in a dispensary i got two questions
what's the most potent and what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make me feel like i'm going downhill on
the roller coaster like ah you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: guide me right to it i don't want anything
else you know i'm connoisseur level so i
[SPEAKER_01]: like the fact i can do just be like zam
take me right there so so debbie i i oh if
[SPEAKER_05]: i may uh there was a wonderful series of
experiences when uh we still have medical
[SPEAKER_05]: in oregon where there was very low
throughput in the retail experience and
[SPEAKER_05]: that was a really special time because
every individual that came through the
[SPEAKER_05]: door there would be like an hour minimum
conversation engagement because very often
[SPEAKER_05]: people would present exactly the kind of
narrative you said it's like which one
[SPEAKER_05]: makes me feel like i'm going down the
roller coaster etc and really inevitably
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like well let's talk about the
effect matrix let's talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: phytochemistry and dosage and titration
these different delivery systems and then
[SPEAKER_05]: look at all of these novel exciting
products now to like induct the individual
[SPEAKER_05]: into the adventure of exploring the
nuanced altered states of consciousness
[SPEAKER_05]: and the therapeutic effects that can arise
and to really empower them i think also
[SPEAKER_05]: requires this other set of knowledge we're
not talking about which is
[SPEAKER_05]: psychopharmacology there really is this
amazing set of data that illustrates say
[SPEAKER_05]: you prescribe somebody ssris for their
anti-depression effects if you simply give
[SPEAKER_05]: them the drugs the drugs actually over
time for most people are not going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: much for them it's actually going to
generally work to be that you'll see a
[SPEAKER_05]: decreased quality of life over time
however if you combine those drugs for a
[SPEAKER_05]: brief period of time with counseling and
have a little bit of human interaction
[SPEAKER_05]: then all of a sudden you're engaging in
this incredible sort of effect boosting
[SPEAKER_05]: potentiating result that we see strong
evidence to support in the
[SPEAKER_05]: psychopharmacology world so there's this
fascinating sense that i think one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things that we're missing is we have you
know this perspective of give me the thing
[SPEAKER_05]: that does this and now we actually need
the well it's not it doesn't work like
[SPEAKER_05]: that but here's this range of things and
dose is going to matter tremendously so we
[SPEAKER_05]: want you to start with this tiny increment
so you can get to know what that is at
[SPEAKER_05]: different times in the day at different
levels of stress that you're experiencing
[SPEAKER_05]: etc come to know this one element and then
gradually build that until you hit
[SPEAKER_05]: undesirable side effects and then you know
the threshold at least for now based on
[SPEAKER_05]: your current tolerance and then you back
off a bit but that sense of like a mature
[SPEAKER_05]: titration process
[SPEAKER_05]: adventure it's this other human element
that i don't think it's rocket science i
[SPEAKER_05]: think it's a bit of empathetic attuning
and it's actually just the sense of being
[SPEAKER_05]: heard as a consumer and then also being
supported that there's something about
[SPEAKER_05]: that interaction that's such a wonderful
opportunity which largely as we went from
[SPEAKER_05]: medical to adult use went away because of
massive you know volume of transactions
[SPEAKER_05]: and this kind of high throughput model and
then a lot of savvy marketing campaigns
[SPEAKER_05]: saying this product does this this one
does that and then really this kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: giant cloud of confusion over what has
been a movement for decades you know from
[SPEAKER_05]: the bay on to really help people to
actually improve their quality of life to
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lifelong sustainable relationship
with these products whether it is hash or
[SPEAKER_05]: hash and flower form which actually was my
favorite comment of the whole show today
[SPEAKER_05]: except anyways i i just think that we we
have so far to go and unfortunately if we
[SPEAKER_05]: go too soon to the overarching categories
we lose a lot on the other hand if we
[SPEAKER_05]: spend too long spinning in infinite
diversity we also lose a lot of engagement
[SPEAKER_05]: and so it's of course both are so
important and i just really love the
[SPEAKER_05]: pragmatism of your comment and also have
wrestled that a lot i think almost i'm the
[SPEAKER_05]: worst person to answer what those
absolutely essential archetypal categories
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to be or what they look like
because everything i'm doing in my inquiry
[SPEAKER_05]: just illustrates greater range in
diversity than i could have imagined
[SPEAKER_05]: possible and then you bring nick into the
conversation and we're looking at a level
[SPEAKER_05]: of phytochemical inventory inventory that
so far surpasses what we've conventionally
[SPEAKER_05]: been talking about and you know including
aldehydes esters plavonoids all these
[SPEAKER_05]: other compounds that are clearly
contributing and you know they connect
[SPEAKER_05]: with dr david marie's work that
illustrated that in fact cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_05]: not the key variable and why the autistic
kids started having incredibly heightened
[SPEAKER_05]: aggression and you know a child throwing
his mother through a plate glass window
[SPEAKER_05]: when dose a which was a one-to-one ratio
then gets replaced with dose b also a
[SPEAKER_05]: one-to-one ratio and radically different
effects and you know there's just so much
[SPEAKER_05]: mystery about the effect itself but i
think there are ways to study that and i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think that's neatly connecting the
dots with phytochemistry at this point
[SPEAKER_05]: we're immature there clinically we just
simply don't have that maturity i see the
[SPEAKER_05]: camps that are doing it and david is
certainly out in front or dd but i think
[SPEAKER_05]: there's another approach which dr ad ray i
wish she was on this call because the
[SPEAKER_05]: reality she has a really wonderful
summation of how to approach that human
[SPEAKER_05]: connection to effect and experience based
on a really rigorous scientific approach
[SPEAKER_05]: and i just think that voice isn't at the
table that would be a really fun
[SPEAKER_05]: additional tense and fantastic uh dynamic
to bring forward yeah let me love in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation go ahead debbie all right i
was just sitting here thinking okay people
[SPEAKER_01]: come into the shop and this is what they
want to do they've got a health condition
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to transform they feel one way
they want to ingest cannabis and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to feel a different way right better
or they're coming into the shop because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like i'm going to do something i
want to go hiking and what's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the best i'm going to study what's going
to be the best i want to sleep what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the best it's it's an actual
experiential thing that they're asking us
[SPEAKER_01]: about they're not asking us about the
chemicals they're like what's best for
[SPEAKER_01]: swimming you know what's going to be best
for watching a movie well you know i want
[SPEAKER_01]: to connect with my partner best for
swimming for real they're literally asking
[SPEAKER_05]: what's best for swimming i've had those
same comments but how do we classify for
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer like this is the one for
sweat i don't know i'm just saying it's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting it's a there's a molecular
conversation and the fact is the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: is looking for a sensory experience that's
transformational i feel like this and i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do this and where do the two
connect and and and like and we can talk
[SPEAKER_01]: for hours of course and figure out all
these different classification systems but
[SPEAKER_01]: i think we agree there's not one yet
either on the macro or the micro and and
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is a mature market already i mean
we've been retailing legally me and atn
[SPEAKER_01]: since the 90s and or you know it's it's uh
it is a mature market right now right now
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sativa indica and hybrid are used
by our buyers and our staff uh as a
[SPEAKER_01]: classification for experience it's not so
much with the real what the real plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: if we call it indica because we think
that's going to be more of a couchy type
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis if we call it sativa we think
it's going to be more uplifting you know
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway i'm just saying i totally
understand that devy people do that the
[SPEAKER_05]: problem is it just doesn't work and i
really mean that you know i get that we've
[SPEAKER_05]: all defaulted to a kind of jargon that is
[SPEAKER_05]: hurting but the problem is it doesn't work
so i think there is a ways to go every
[SPEAKER_05]: time i have the chance just to make it
really really simple i simply start with
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it just doesn't work like that
there's like over a thousand bioactive
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds and you need constellations in
each one of these lots and even if you get
[SPEAKER_05]: the same product from the same producer
you're probably not going to see bedrakan
[SPEAKER_05]: like trait stability and the chemo bar
expression you're actually going to
[SPEAKER_05]: experience a range of things so embrace
the adventure here's some tools for the
[SPEAKER_05]: ride you need to understand titration with
all this explorer and the great news is
[SPEAKER_05]: unless a bale of it falls on your head
it's probably not going to do harm
[SPEAKER_05]: although now we actually have to deal with
cannabinoid hyper emesis syndrome which
[SPEAKER_05]: i've just had my second experience with in
the last month and it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: horrifying to see what people go through
it is actually a psychosis that pre-empts
[SPEAKER_05]: that is before the cyclical vomiting which
is it's a really wild experience that is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually legitimately happening to a now
significant population of people concerned
[SPEAKER_05]: outside of that the bale of it needs to
fucking fall on your head so it's safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: therefore enjoy the adventure like let's
not actually project immature systems onto
[SPEAKER_05]: the infinite amazing layers and
vicissitudes of this relationship between
[SPEAKER_05]: people and plant let's rather encourage a
passionate exploration and resource with
[SPEAKER_05]: the best science and evidence that we have
in a limited way you know that sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: thing i always get off on so so when i was
a budtender and someone would come in
[SPEAKER_06]: asking for an indica or sativa or what
would help them swim i would do exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: what jeremy's doing i would say but it
doesn't work like that and i would try to
[SPEAKER_06]: explain to them the complexity of the
effect matrix and all these things and
[SPEAKER_06]: then i'd get yelled at by my boss because
he's like dude i love the fact that you
[SPEAKER_06]: just want to educate each and every
individual customer that comes in each
[SPEAKER_06]: time but you are slowing down my entire
operation i have a line out the door these
[SPEAKER_06]: people are you can't even understand half
the shit you're saying their eyes are
[SPEAKER_06]: rolling in the back of their head there's
got to be a meeting in the middle point
[SPEAKER_06]: where all of the stuff that jeremy's
saying which is 100 real and true that the
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer doesn't know what they don't know
they don't know what to ask and sometimes
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't have the time of day to get the
type of education that we're so passionate
[SPEAKER_06]: about and want to offer to them and so
that's the reason why i'm trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: develop this app with this aroma science
company that does cannabis aroma the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that i think nick is doing hop aroma in
probably very similar ways and in wrapping
[SPEAKER_06]: that in with just a little bit of
interpreting methodology but also for the
[SPEAKER_06]: first time grading cannabis how good is
this weed am i buying good weed or bad
[SPEAKER_06]: weed what is good weed who sets the line
for what good is and how do you measure
[SPEAKER_06]: that so at the end of the day hopefully
what we'll be able to do is if you either
[SPEAKER_06]: are searching for something particular or
you can go into a dispensary that doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: offer deli style anymore which is horrible
pre-packaged cannabis you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_06]: to see if your body is attracted to this
plant or not hopefully you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: scan it with your cell phone and it's just
going to have one page of information that
[SPEAKER_06]: will tell you on a scale of good to bad
this is how good this product has been
[SPEAKER_06]: graded and on a scale from stimulating the
sedative this is where a computer based
[SPEAKER_06]: off of aroma profiles have found it to be
which has been collaborated with
[SPEAKER_06]: interpreters people who are really
passionate about the flavor the aroma the
[SPEAKER_06]: effect type of cannabis all together so
that at the end of the day a consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't have to know and understand the
details of this complexity they just have
[SPEAKER_06]: to scan a jar of flour and see okay these
really smart guys who are super passionate
[SPEAKER_06]: cracked the code of what this varietal is
and they just programmed it in a quick
[SPEAKER_06]: information space for me to say oh this is
a ninety one point two six percent so this
[SPEAKER_06]: is an a minus grade cannabis that has
really gassy and fruity tones which
[SPEAKER_06]: generally is going to equate to this type
of an effect for nine out of ten people
[SPEAKER_06]: and also if you want to go even crazier
you can slide over and be like where's its
[SPEAKER_06]: appellation what's its terroir what's the
grower story what's the history and try to
[SPEAKER_06]: you know offer cannabis in that way but
before I have to jet and get out of here
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy I think did a good job of
celebrating Nick and all of the work that
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick is doing and after slightly
embarrassingly but very much thanks and
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually humbled to be invited to
speak with all of you all this has been
[SPEAKER_06]: fantastic well I just wanted to celebrate
what Jeremy's is doing because I think
[SPEAKER_06]: you're when you described the way that
you're going about your version of growing
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in a controlled environment with
different environments indoors that's
[SPEAKER_06]: replicatable I believe what you're talking
about can and would have a terroir and so
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna make that leap from you can't
have indoor terroir to if you're doing it
[SPEAKER_06]: the way Jeremy is well then yes you could
definitely apply the ideology of of
[SPEAKER_06]: terroir in that way and you're also
pushing a boundary to every French person
[SPEAKER_06]: is just yelling at the computer right now
no you can't do this like what like this
[SPEAKER_06]: is it's to the uh then oh my god and like
I'm like frenchy cannoli is like screaming
[SPEAKER_06]: in the background no you can't do it
indoors I think you I think I think
[SPEAKER_06]: because you're you're going about it in
such a passionately intelligent way and
[SPEAKER_06]: the term that you keep referring back to
maturity I think there you're bringing a
[SPEAKER_06]: maturity to the idea of how growing indoor
and consistent cannabis could and should
[SPEAKER_06]: be done and in my geography and where I
come from those guys just aren't there yet
[SPEAKER_06]: man they're just trying to pump money
right they're just shooting pounds how
[SPEAKER_06]: many what kind of light lumens can I get
for how many pounds because at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: the day my goal is to make millions of
dollars and retire on this weed thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been that I love since high school
that's it it's it's not the same amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: care it's not the same amount of passion
and it's not the same amount of maturity
[SPEAKER_06]: so I just wanted to share with you that
I'm proud of the work that you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm very appreciative of it and that I
would I'd like to learn a lot more about
[SPEAKER_07]: it if yeah I can I can speak to that as
well I was super impressed by Jeremy the
[SPEAKER_07]: first time I met him and that has only
grown and actually getting to see the
[SPEAKER_07]: facility and sample some of the the
product that you have you've created was
[SPEAKER_07]: just a pleasure and I got to come back
next month in Portland dude that was a
[SPEAKER_05]: that was fantastic well I'm honored and
sincerely a lot of my passion has been
[SPEAKER_05]: informed by other people present on the
church right now and I just I again want
[SPEAKER_05]: to thank Marcus for facilitating a
conversation that includes as many diverse
[SPEAKER_05]: perspectives and call into constantly big
up and support that process and Sam to
[SPEAKER_05]: inspire all of us to be at the foundation
Debbie to keep it real at the end to lay
[SPEAKER_05]: down the foundation for the very activism
anyways all these great humans but the
[SPEAKER_05]: reality is I just am also grateful to you
max for all of that feedback and for the
[SPEAKER_05]: bold efforts that you've made to
essentially you know really really take a
[SPEAKER_05]: point position and leading sensory forward
in our space knowing how absolutely vital
[SPEAKER_05]: this is to the especially the producers I
care about the most who often the people
[SPEAKER_05]: who can show you their soil and how much
love and concern that they've put into
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's like they're not able to get any
kind of value at wholesale level and most
[SPEAKER_05]: of the high throughput retail locations
right now and until sensory comes in and
[SPEAKER_05]: validates that until a critical momentum
is achieved where we can actually
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize that all cannabis is not being
produced on an equal level there's
[SPEAKER_05]: tremendous variance in quality quality is
yet to be identified in a mature way and
[SPEAKER_05]: this is grinding up people who have been
multi-generational farmers who are the
[SPEAKER_05]: very best at this craft and I'm just so
excited to see that reality start to turn
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think everybody's contributing to
that in this discourse but anyways just
[SPEAKER_05]: such an awesome honor to be in hash church
again and here with family working on
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging issues that will probably
outlive us and that I hope we all get to
[SPEAKER_05]: somehow support and breathe more life into
because gosh we have a long ways to go
[SPEAKER_10]: well I have no doubt these conversations
are incredibly important and I didn't
[SPEAKER_10]: really know it when I first started hash
church and even after a couple years and
[SPEAKER_10]: then I looked back four or five years
later and I had taken some big breaks and
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like oh wow that was really
important conversation and it's it's how I
[SPEAKER_10]: feel now again that these conversations
are incredibly important it's great that
[SPEAKER_10]: we're having them and I thank all of you
for showing up and uh yeah engaging in
[SPEAKER_06]: these dialogues it's awesome thanks so
much everybody great conversation thank
[SPEAKER_09]: you uh Marcus great meeting you Max I love
to connect with you talk more definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: like to talk yeah and Nick man I want I
want to go to Nick's school like same it's
[SPEAKER_06]: a scary place dude it's a scary place oh
man like uh and I can't wait to tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys about the cannabis uh in hops uh new
species that's been hybridized together at
[SPEAKER_06]: an f7 that I'm writing about in the new
interpreting book that's coming out this
[SPEAKER_06]: year and uh how can you start something
like that and then bail hey Marcus how
[SPEAKER_06]: about next hash church we're gonna get
into all the funky types of cannabis like
[SPEAKER_06]: uh you know that you know that duck's foot
was first scientifically described in the
[SPEAKER_06]: 1920s I've got white papers on duck foot
oh no I've got them from the 1800s yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly like this is like I think we you
know what Marcus next hash church will be
[SPEAKER_06]: the most unique and bizarre cannabis
varietals and even types that are pushing
[SPEAKER_06]: the boundary of being cannabis and are now
moving into humulis cannabis humulis I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely feeling a continuation I tried
to hybridize hops with cannabis we we
[SPEAKER_02]: tried every hop species we could find and
we crossed it with cannabis and we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: vice versa we never got any
cross-pollination fertilization whatsoever
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm not saying because there's a trick
up someone's sleeve the guy who did it and
[SPEAKER_06]: who figured it out there's a trick to it
so um and and you've confirmed that it
[SPEAKER_07]: contains both genomes oh yeah there's a
bit of a problem with that because the
[SPEAKER_07]: genome is already contained within the
cannabis plant right so anyway till next
[SPEAKER_06]: hash church this would be this would be a
whole nother three hour uh haul uh I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna I'm gonna uh go take care we can go
bro what are you talking about we do five
[SPEAKER_02]: hours all the time I'm just joking we'll
do it next Sunday um I'm telling you max
[SPEAKER_02]: we tried so hard to do that I'm not saying
it's impossible but uh I've never never
[SPEAKER_02]: seen it I've heard at least a hundred
different people say they could do it so
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you the trick very curious the
trick is to use a species of hops that
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody uses to produce beer with yeah but
we we use a species of a species of hops
[SPEAKER_07]: hops is polytypic the way cannabis is not
yeah uh okay well I definitely need to
[SPEAKER_07]: connect with you on this because this
would be really interesting for for me for
[SPEAKER_06]: a variety of reasons uh so yeah and I mean
um you know uh you know we also discovered
[SPEAKER_06]: glandular trichomes that have never been
scientifically um looked at before so I've
[SPEAKER_06]: got a contract with two different
universities who have confirmed both in
[SPEAKER_06]: South Korea and Colorado that cannabis
glandular trichomes that we have found
[SPEAKER_06]: that look unlike any other trichome type
are definitely novel and what they'll uh
[SPEAKER_06]: uh this year when I flower these plants
out they're actually going to um dissect
[SPEAKER_06]: the anatomy of the glandular trichomes as
they're alive in their living state which
[SPEAKER_02]: is why they have to do this many times max
with lasers that's already been done novel
[SPEAKER_10]: trichomes he's talking about there yeah
brand new trichomes types but I think yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: just a quick question for you here um I'd
love to I sent an email to what I thought
[SPEAKER_07]: was everybody on here but um I think we've
got some new late joins that weren't in
[SPEAKER_07]: the original email thread um is the chat
uh does that get published as well or is
[SPEAKER_10]: that is that private uh the the chat here
it does not get published the zoom chat
[SPEAKER_10]: but the one on youtube does okay so the
zoom chat's private then right yeah I just
[SPEAKER_06]: shot you my email in the zoom chat oh no I
just shot that to Debbie let me shoot it
[SPEAKER_07]: to everybody I just hit mine so hit us up
please yeah you want to connect some more
[SPEAKER_06]: that'd be great oh for sure I oh and when
you asked for volunteers to help create a
[SPEAKER_06]: standard for it sounds like we're trying
to create something like uh IBUs in in
[SPEAKER_06]: beer but for for cannabis in a variety of
different ways anyways I would love to be
[SPEAKER_06]: on that team in that project and explore
those ideas sounds great
[SPEAKER_06]: I will I actually have a ton of
photographs of the cannabis and hops
[SPEAKER_06]: crosses and uh in a variety of different
ones too there's there's a handful of them
[SPEAKER_06]: um and and you'll you'll see these plants
will be like oh my gosh that is a hop
[SPEAKER_06]: plant growing THC and CBD rich cones and
uh and vice versa really interesting have
[SPEAKER_02]: you tested the hops with analysis yes yes
we have done cannabinoid analysis the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that we haven't done yet is
genealogy so uh genome testing is coming
[SPEAKER_06]: next very cool max yeah hey you guys rock
um Marcus thank you so much for inviting
[SPEAKER_06]: me to be a part of this hash church this
was a good one and I'm just so thankful to
[SPEAKER_06]: uh to be with all these uh really
incredible uh cannabis leaders uh
[SPEAKER_10]: intellectuals so thank you so much yeah
thanks for coming out man we'll definitely
[SPEAKER_10]: try to continue this next week that was
like a solid like solid three plus you
[SPEAKER_10]: know three almost three hours you guys all
went on and it was great I really enjoyed
[SPEAKER_10]: it it was uh it's always a pleasure to
have uh uh everyone on the panel and to
[SPEAKER_10]: join today was a good one like today was a
good one it's gonna this one's gonna be
[SPEAKER_10]: popular in the podcast form I suspect so
for those that don't feel like watching
[SPEAKER_10]: YouTube this shows up on like um Android
and Google and Apple and Spotify and
[SPEAKER_10]: Pandora and all those sorts of things uh
just under hash church 3.0 and I'll be
[SPEAKER_10]: uploading it today at the end of this
episode which I suspect I'll yeah let it
[SPEAKER_10]: go for another 12 minutes we can keep
chatting a little bit and maybe Nick uh
[SPEAKER_02]: can hops are uh heterozygote correct uh
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to understand how hops can
cross with cannabis I mean I did the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing Robin I spent several years trying
to do it we got every species of hops
[SPEAKER_02]: there was in the entire world the rarest
ones were from China but we could never
[SPEAKER_07]: get them diabetes the unionensis has
actually been uh disproven as a species um
[SPEAKER_07]: we're pretty sure that that's we got it
anyway yeah the uh you probably got the
[SPEAKER_07]: Tsingtao flower uh yeah so yeah hops are
are they've got a high level of
[SPEAKER_07]: heterozygoticity um and yeah a lot of
repeats as well so but it's a it's
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting the people have tried people
have have had limited success and uh
[SPEAKER_07]: they've been able to to cross them and
then they tend to die uh before like the
[SPEAKER_07]: fourth internode starts to yeah I've seen
people graft them I grafted them no no I
[SPEAKER_07]: mean the the grafting works but then
actually even even hybridizing them they
[SPEAKER_02]: they have been able to get all the stick
and then it dies quickly yeah we could not
[SPEAKER_02]: get any set seed yeah either on the hops
or on the cannabis vice versa because we
[SPEAKER_05]: did it both ways one totally different
idea here that's parallel I'm sure you're
[SPEAKER_05]: aware of a type five cannabis variety so
now we have a knockout that's in the
[SPEAKER_05]: synthesis resulting in cannabinoid null
profile these aroma rich cannabis products
[SPEAKER_05]: being used for dry hop addition or dry
hemp addition uh strikes me as offering a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole novel array of you know aroma
contributions on the ale side uh on the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis side a little bit yeah different
but interesting I have yet to see type
[SPEAKER_05]: five plants actually being used in that
way but it sure seems like a novel and fun
[SPEAKER_02]: application by dr demeyer right that was
our work I I recall thank you for
[SPEAKER_05]: reminding me some amazing work and
ultimately I can't wait till I get to play
[SPEAKER_05]: with some of those type five plants I've
never ever found one in any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: sessions I've hunted and always hoped that
somewhere in a type three population I'd
[SPEAKER_05]: run into that but you have lots of type
fours now oh sorry what was that it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: mutation yes natural mutation hey everyone
I really appreciate the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_07]: speak with you and Jeremy always a
pleasure and Marcus thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_07]: setting this up it's this is just a
fantastic privilege so I hope we can we
[SPEAKER_07]: can do it again and I'd love to connect
you guys put my email in the chat and I
[SPEAKER_07]: sent an email to those who were on the
original chain but please reach out if
[SPEAKER_07]: you'd like to discuss anything further and
I will definitely be reaching out to some
[SPEAKER_07]: of you guys so thank you all so much I
have a strong feeling you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_07]: about a dozen emails great new people
talking about fun things that I care about
[SPEAKER_07]: this is fantastic I mean what's not to
like so yeah thanks for showing up Nick it
[SPEAKER_10]: was indeed a pleasure thanks Jeremy for
linking me up to Nick and you know anytime
[SPEAKER_10]: anyone wants to link me up with great
people I immediately share those great
[SPEAKER_10]: people with the world so I do appreciate
it and yeah thank you both Max and Nick
[SPEAKER_10]: and everyone else for showing up today it
was it was fun I suspect we'll be thinking
[SPEAKER_10]: for the next seven days solid before next
Sunday people get everyone's gonna have a
[SPEAKER_07]: presentation available like Nick did oh
that wasn't a presentation I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: avoid the the murder by PowerPoint or
death by PowerPoint problem so I was
[SPEAKER_10]: liking it I was I just loved the whole the
whole day today everything from Max
[SPEAKER_10]: starting for you from you Debbie coming in
like just it was all just really quite
[SPEAKER_10]: enjoyable all sorts of beautiful words
said by Jeremy and Wade chimed in very
[SPEAKER_10]: early with which is always just like a
pleasure and a privilege to hear his voice
[SPEAKER_10]: on a Sunday morning in my ears I always
you know there is a vibration from Wade's
[SPEAKER_10]: voice that is that I can say does create a
calming effect I can I can say that with a
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred percent truth so thanks Wade
thanks everybody he has a voice made for
[SPEAKER_07]: radio I have a face made for radio so all
right y'all thank you so much I hope to
[SPEAKER_03]: chat again soon bye guys bye bye everybody
thanks guys thank you Marcus really good
[SPEAKER_10]: session yeah we're gonna do it again next
week for sure so let's all let's all come
[SPEAKER_10]: back next week and I'll see you then peace
y'all peace out you you you
