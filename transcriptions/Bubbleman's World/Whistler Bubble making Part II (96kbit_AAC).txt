[SPEAKER_01]: So, check in this left at function here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I used to go dirt bike
riding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheapest late for service for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: East side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we are in the trees here on
the ice and snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly making our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it's getting pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start that over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Phil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this where we're going to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the fresh frozen in the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble bags over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be mixing up a batch here
in the beautiful check of this river.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're right next to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just felt the whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to whip up a fresh batch of My
Little Pony with John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to go get water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude is a machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just half full is even good, so it's not
too heavy for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, cold, chilly, glacier fed
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come grab one with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to show them the creek real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The river.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're standing here on the side of the
Cheek of This River with Phil and John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an eight bag original bubble bag
kit, five gallon, about to go in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil's just collected a bunch of water
from the check of this river, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely cold, I can assure you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought up a cooler of our own ice,
and John was kind enough to cut My Little
[SPEAKER_02]: Pony down.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes My Little Pony right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Morioh?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're making bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morioh's helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're going to start with
the 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm not even going to worry
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flipping the bags over the edge right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll leave them open like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number white.
[SPEAKER_02]: 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, number white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Color 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven to three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have both.
[SPEAKER_02]: The jacket is so thick that when I put my
arms in the bucket, I push all the bags
[SPEAKER_02]: into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what kind of success rate I
actually have through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to do a little outside
bucket trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little way to speed up putting your bags
into one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get the orange one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the order proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to mess that hash up.
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 is a nice grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the 160 bag, the orange bag,
specifically to secure the quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, the purity of that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get these bags in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of you are looking at me like
I'm an alien right now because you've
[SPEAKER_02]: fiddled with your bubble bags for half an
hour at a time trying to get them all to
[SPEAKER_02]: fit inside one another nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this way is a little quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is where we're going to run out of
time again, as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not like we're in a huge rush,
but we wanted to make sure we did some
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble making today somewhere cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned we would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really want to, you can one by
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All down and tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does secure them nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have all the tools here for doing our
instructions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our spoon for mixing everything
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our trusty little bag over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some bigger spoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I figured we could all get a shot
hand stirring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're obviously not going to be bubble
mowing up here in the electrical free
[SPEAKER_02]: zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Electrical free zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our spoons.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pulling our bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some bigger spoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're going to pour a bucket
of water in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some nice cold water.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some ice in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's use about half that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let's put some fresh frozen down
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll hold that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold that for a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our recipe in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, show them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have about 400 grams there,
John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roughly, I would actually use a bed table
to grind all this stuff up in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because it's so fresh, we're just
going to freeze it directly in that ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put a half in about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bring this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's half of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little cold away a little early,
but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get all that niceness off
of there like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let's go to this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we brought the good ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hold that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going to the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this one's pretty low to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how we wash our pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're getting it all nice and filled
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a ton of ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a wooden spoon, the old school method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done this way in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually use the bubble now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we used the paddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did use the paddle on the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't use the paddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we don't want to leave this in the
water for too long, so I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: reconstitute it, get the buds really
worked in there so they're not all
[SPEAKER_02]: floating up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have tons of ice in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we'll do is we'll probably work
with two or three spoons for approximately
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 minutes, five to 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, once it gets a little more
mixed, we'll be able to do a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, the ice is doing two jobs,
keeping the water cold and knocking off
[SPEAKER_02]: the glandular trichome heads from their
capitate stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just absolutely... Aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, aromatherapy is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part about this is actually
watching my resin being stirred in ice and
[SPEAKER_04]: water and knowing that great medicine that
I'm going to get from the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: product is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, of course, you'll be seeing
pictures of what we've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're getting that color change in the
ice already.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to see the color change in
the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a little excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some ice falling all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the buds need to fall off the ground
to get thrown back in at the blink of an
[SPEAKER_04]: eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you blink, you might miss something
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a little bit more melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's more room to actually mix
the material on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to hear that ice bashing
back and forth because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: working those trichome heads off there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that river in the background is
actually giving us that sense of keep
[SPEAKER_04]: working it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's bringing it all back.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Ed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here on the side of the river at
Whistler?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so really beautiful zone to be making
bubbling once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping the river coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess from Black Tusk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit different from the
bubble now, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the bubble now, we get a better mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always notice that with some of the
other grunts that I've ran in the past and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is old school method and this
is the way it all started, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old hand stirring.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I ever made it was with an
actual cake mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to use a little cake mixer and
then halfway down the way, we just sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out maybe gentler is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got the spoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the spoon was like if you mixed it
too little, you didn't do a good enough
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mixed it too hard, you did too much
of a job, then it was actually a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a trick to get the spoon mix
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I came out with the bubble
now where a friend of mine called me and
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, if you check these units
out, I looked into them, I used it a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of times, and I found that it
basically made like a perfect hand stir
[SPEAKER_02]: batch every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect hand stir batch every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a perfect hand stir batch going
on right here, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take over whenever you're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's best to just do like a minute or two,
you know, stay nice and fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the material after I want to
keep, I'm going to do the second run with
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a great amount of icing here,
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it being at zero degrees right
now, it's almost snowing in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guarantee everything staying nice and cold
here, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of this out in the
snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is obviously more like my own
backyard, so it feels pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played around in here for 20 plus
years on my dirt bike, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just up the mountain on my snowboarding
sled, just across these streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty neat to be whipping up a
batch in the playground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we still on record there?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little blotting in the top, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to make sure, good to make sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a little wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, the smell from that right now is
just amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got the nicest whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little whip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to stir from the man himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew the resin, isolated the heads,
and he loaded the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass it over when you've got a good
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's medicinal making your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: He who makes his own hash heals himself
twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best part about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the golden color you got in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to pass off this steaming
stick here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like to use the bubble now
machine because of my balance and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, so it's actually a little bit
more convenient for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, it takes the heavy work out of
it because this is really the only work
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're doing is just mixing with the
ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're having problems mixing,
get yourself a bubble now and really
[SPEAKER_04]: that's all the work that's needed to make
a fresh bowl that hasn't actually grown
[SPEAKER_04]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then of course the drying is
really the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part you want to watch the
videos over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about that a lot on the water
extraction and team dry sift on our
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, both of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Team dry sift obviously more for the dry
sift, but drying techniques about water
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction and drying techniques page on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, water extraction and drying
techniques on Facebook is a great place to
[SPEAKER_04]: learn and also understand your medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm really glad we stopped and did
the batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we've been trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a seat.
Still
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a seat here and pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch us stir the medicine up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing a hand stir,
generally I'll always do it for more than
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll do like five to eight,
even 10 minutes because you notice when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're hand stirring, the stirring happens
for a bit and we stop and pass the spoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That time doesn't count the way it does in
a washing machine when it's constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing it back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just came off the stock like a nice
cooking salmon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a beautiful day here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roar of the river behind us,
which is why we're trying to pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: yell so the camera can pick our voices up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see how sticky that is in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're losing all the sticky ice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we definitely have a great cold
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the ice is barely melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love making hash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chalk up one more cool spot, I've made
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The side of a river in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us, until March 31st, all three of
us, we're legally allowed to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our licenses, we're federally
exempt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't go rubbing it in people's faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to quiet, remote places,
but we're allowed to isolate our medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: here in British Columbia thanks to Owen
Smith in the Regina versus Smith case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles in Victoria, where they want the
right to use THC in any of its forms,
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate or otherwise, just like the
constitution says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild man in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pull these bags real quick
and see what we got.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, so we're back after mixing.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's still mixing.
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason, I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to pull this blue bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, does that smell good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of ice.
Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put it in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figured to carry it over there,
just in case we collect any residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just carry it over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got, you want to hold this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60, 190, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very, very small, which is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, look at the water in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting this in here because I'm going
to have to do a second run of this later.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so try to scoop that up with
your spoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be taking this because that was just
so darn convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the scariest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just took the dirty leaf covered bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, you did okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Moses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, try to walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to stay on either side of the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was a bit scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mild heart attack there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it's only the 160 bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of leaf in it from the bag
that you dropped in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well then, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy, but it's just your 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pay attention when you're
making fumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I said, funny enough,
was let's not look like yahoos while we do
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he flips the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flips the inside out and goes to dump
it into our bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: To clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would clean it all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's covered in leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you're putting it in the
separate pressing screen each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to do this, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep you, right now you're blocking
the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep you right here and we'll keep
Phil right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll kind of do it that way and we'll
keep the camera open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Phil's going to clean the 160
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a little bit of leaf in it,
which won't be the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pull the 120 and possibly
pass it over to John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have another bucket?
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be hung, that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that bucket has to be taken out
because we need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, for future references,
we don't want to put the bucket on the
[SPEAKER_02]: dirty ground because it may contaminate
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass it over to John.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you to hang that one over by the
blue bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we're working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never actually, the three of us made
bubble together, but it's not a super
[SPEAKER_02]: overly complex process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important part is that you rinse a bag
in water after you've made bubble with it
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you hang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of these bags will be cleaned in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little water right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be able to pour some of that on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to dip it right there in
the puddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right at the top of that puddle,
kind of give it a little dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to clean the bags
immediately after using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in a colder environment,
so we've got that working in our favor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be a, if it was
really warm, the bubble would melt fast on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bags when you took it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This 120 looks amazing, like unbelievable
beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that
[SPEAKER_02]: view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot hashtag Y spray paint.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard it from Phil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get the rest of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hang that over there and then come
back and we'll do this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my funnest places I've ever made
bubble, hands down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about the 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slow draining.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to keep it open.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up, nice and slow draining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks white, like the color of the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always nice to have a little bucket like
this to be able to flip the product inside
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the color on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real nice fresh 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still recording?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you, bubble hash making is
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you don't have to do
inside a shitty basement or down inside
[SPEAKER_02]: your house anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get out and actually do this in
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that's kind of nature
friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if people drove by right now,
not that there's really many places to
[SPEAKER_02]: drop by, they might be concerned as to
what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But upon quick examination of the
situation and the safety of it all,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to rinse this one in the 73
just a little bit quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collect any of those lost resin heads and
then we'll get them to rinse it in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're actually using glacier puddle water
just here on the side of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: 73 time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, many, many hundreds of batches will
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I love the size of these buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are real great buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start promoting these for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are working great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cow's ice cream and Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cow's ice cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_02]: quality resin cleans up like you can still
get the last little bits guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's already hard on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the 45 and the 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are slow draining bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you know the technique,
then they're quick draining bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always inspired to make some lovely
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, the 45 is painted the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire screen covered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more bag, the 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to be drying it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take it and freeze our
patties that we get and we'll be taking
[SPEAKER_02]: them back either to John's or to Phil's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And powderizing them into boxes and
getting them ready for the dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The desiccant wicking out the hash,
the moisture from the outside of the hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing the glandular trichome head to be
dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, now you can cure the head,
let it shrivel up like a raisin and let
[SPEAKER_02]: that wax membrane dehydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do those both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a quick rinse.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, make a bubble with
three guys is nice and quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whip this batch off in no time flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick technique with the 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lift it up real quick, lifting the resin
off the screen and allowing the water to
[SPEAKER_02]: rush through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes for a much quicker drain than
what some of you guys have done in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some funny stories of people
telling me how long their 25 micron bag
[SPEAKER_02]: took to dry or drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll happen with quality resin
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 micron, still in the water,
but with this technique of lifting the
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket, it seems to suck the water out as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the stainless steel spoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, if you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's having a hard time getting that one
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wearing these big jackets and if we
turn our backs to the camera, the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: screen is already taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have trust
[SPEAKER_02]: in the guy that showed you how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy knows how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm just working the resin over
top of the screen and getting it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: thicker because right now quite a bit of
it is foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actual bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking up more space than it needs
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually getting a natural rain
spray that's falling down on top of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful hashing water into the creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, the color of that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys saw that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at all this ice we got going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, that's all I can smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, putting those bags away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we'll give you a quick little
peek of what we've been doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our bubbles here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back with you when we're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're inside, we're out of the rain,
we've got all our gear put away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out and watching us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in beautiful British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: John, once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy good times.
Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil, thanks for joining us, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always nice to have good friends coming up
with ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: John, pleasure is a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, catch up with you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you soon.
