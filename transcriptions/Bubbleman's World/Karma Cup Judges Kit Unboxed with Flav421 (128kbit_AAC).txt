[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to bubble man's world
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my good pal Flav421 Hello
all as you can see he's brought some
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond epic glass and Today we're going to
be doing an unboxing video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this box to unbox and it is in
regards to the upcoming Fifth annual karma
[SPEAKER_01]: cup not sure how well you guys can see
that t-shirt there I can always take a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and put it on top, but Yeah,
there it goes fifth annual karma cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't have the dates on here,
but I believe it's September 9th and 10th
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe so you can google it fifth
annual karma cup and that's Sarah Sunday
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's putting that on and we sort of
thought let's do the unboxing video
[SPEAKER_01]: together He brought these absolutely tell
us about these pieces of glass This one's
[SPEAKER_02]: a depi with a punty disclet inside Some
cold work action and some exos ball or
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah XO sure yeah XO ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's definitely what we've
been calling it This one though,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is one of my personal favorites in
my collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made by Jake A couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the unmarked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no MS markings on it at all
whatsoever It was made as an homage for
[SPEAKER_02]: his father to demonstrate all the various
techniques that he had learned over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years And his leaf pattern work here,
which has always been some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have belt buckles and pendants by him
with these It's really a special piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the first times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ever been out photographed or in
video Yes, the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the very first time actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the very first time it has ever been
So I thought no better person than to have
[SPEAKER_02]: mark come and photograph it and Smoke out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that and we have photographed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not yet smoked out of it So we're
gonna do that soon Maybe we'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: blast and then we'll get to unboxing this
video fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, no, let's unbox this video and then
then have a blast because we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: things to test And I just noticed we have
everything on the table except resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and so we could potentially we've got
a box of it right here I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's herb samples in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be probably co2 And butane
edibles and I'm hoping just a few
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless entries in which case I can
have a few rips myself Well for how the
[SPEAKER_02]: solventless movement in Canada has
progressed over the last number of years I
[SPEAKER_02]: can pretty much guarantee that somebody
has entered some quality solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: something out there Yeah, I would say even
though we didn't so we're gonna clean off
[SPEAKER_01]: the table here and we're gonna do this
unboxing video beautiful All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have Z box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been holding on to this box for a
little bit now I got it probably close to
[SPEAKER_01]: a week ago and didn't Open it so kept it
in a nice cool dark spot in the cellar and

[SPEAKER_01]: why don't we go through a few of these
we'll have a good discussion about that
[SPEAKER_01]: and We'll clean up the rest of this so
it's not sitting in the Sun and we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: right back All right, so we got all that
done as you can see that was a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive pile of samples like Flav was
saying off-camera You wouldn't be upset if
[SPEAKER_02]: you were if you bought no no if you had
paid To be a part of this cup and and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what you received.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be fully satisfied You know like
really like the amount of the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: entries is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of swag is like over the top so
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely happy and even with nine
solventless entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty good I'm not gonna complain so
we do have all the solventless entries
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in the center on an ice pack It's
gotten to be a pretty warm day the glass
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty hot and we just Want to make
sure that we're kind of giving you the
[SPEAKER_01]: best eye candy that we can but not
sacrificing the quality of the product
[SPEAKER_01]: itself So, oh, yeah feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's very bad No, no, that's super
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is entry one solventless entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get our little Yes, I'm guessing
nine of them are gonna be rosin for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting Right off the bat it doesn't
look as bad as I at first thought Little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit like kind of old material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah farmers grade Kif.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not something will probably puff No,
but maybe we'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks like a tumbled single
screen Farmers grade sift We'll go into
[SPEAKER_01]: number two here See what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it be funny if we just like we
just were like we're not popping any of
[SPEAKER_02]: this this is all but we're also like it
looks also like it's a Like it's a pressed
[SPEAKER_02]: key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah This one has a little stamp It looks
like a little medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh it is yeah, you're right a little
doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a picture of it so you guys can
see what we're talking about Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, yes Looks a little furry doesn't look
malty.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm gonna put that one to the side as
well Well or someone for sure they could
[SPEAKER_01]: have probably done it themselves if they
went on the internet And just learned a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of information All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I see the first one that we're
gonna be oh, I don't even have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: ripping these I'm so funny I've always
I've always done that some don't open.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't open.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so The decent consistency for sure Oh
smells like anise Like black liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: totally Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Yeah, like really so maybe we
maybe we have one to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's get a couple of dabs of this
off If we can I'm gonna put it on the on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cold pack is your implement Look at
that how nice it's coming off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No for sure All right Take yourself
however much you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't even pretend to be a champion
Dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just taking reasonable size rips
Whatever that is different to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Different to everyone Wow,
it really has a smell though, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm and really like the licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so licorice It's so licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has me minorly nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really though But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give it a shot and try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's some real super terpy awesome
flavorful, I Guess we better kind of write
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the book here to solve this extract
hybrid solvent extract Okay, right right
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent list so we're in we just did
number one One and two were the pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: key One and two were the pressed key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just kind of kind of put an X
through each of those Number three will
[SPEAKER_01]: put anise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then so smell I mean,
what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one out of tens type of thing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we could do one out of ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I'm wondering if that's what
they're requiring rate the following
[SPEAKER_01]: entries from one to nine Okay,
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean that smell Initially was quite
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know when I hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be off So I would give it a
pretty high number for smell maybe like a
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah seem pretty reasonable I'd say so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then we'll But it's it's it's
literally as if you had fennel growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you were chopping fennel up Yeah,
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do some timing We're gonna hit
some only one of these torches is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with gas Just do the one I guess
that's why the two torches would have come
[SPEAKER_01]: in handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Whatever you got your timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got my timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want me first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You go first brother You go first
Interesting to see what this is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: taste like
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny little bit dripped off my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is so fennel and it's just It
tastes exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's pretty trippy You know,
you always got to be wondering in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community Is it authentic and
it's a unique terpene profile or has
[SPEAKER_01]: someone done something?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they think is gonna try and give them
advantage where they've added something or
[SPEAKER_01]: a terpene that's from Something else not
saying that's the case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be totally solventless rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got pressed from flour or hash I have
no idea but it's Well, we'll know more
[SPEAKER_01]: when once we inhale it into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consistency to me speaks of Flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah looks definitely like a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah All right, so You've got your own
timer so that's great Yeah, it's just the
[SPEAKER_02]: the fennel in these smells It's it is
overpowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But let's see if it passes on to be
like it's it's overpowering not in a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: way No, no, no, I don't know if it's gonna
taste like that Yes, like if there's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be some tweak of not so goodness in it,
so we'll see what happens How long you
[SPEAKER_01]: cooling for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go 40 seconds Yeah,
when you're outside, it's good to shave
[SPEAKER_01]: five or ten seconds off your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it doesn't work out in your
favor You get the hot dab like I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day at Stratis's glass shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did I take a hot dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hot dabs are us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just talking about hot dabs,
too And then I ended up taking like that
[SPEAKER_01]: looked a really proper temperature there
This pipe is just ridiculous by the way
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get one the flavor does not
transfer through that interesting yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I taste oxidized material to be honest not
not to hate on whoever produced this but
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what it tastes like Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely don't like taste
suspect fake turps or anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste was very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost want to bump up the flavor the
smell You know one point just because it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't transfer in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a little bit worried Yeah,
I think that that is a great smell that's
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very it's not something that you and
even the taste I think I could give the
[SPEAKER_01]: taste a solid six to seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to say between us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way it's grabbed my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's grabbed me but throw
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got Some unique taste in there What
do you think let's be I'd give it a six on
[SPEAKER_02]: the taste Yeah, yeah, I would feel very
comfortable giving it a six We provided
[SPEAKER_01]: this lovely dark crystal glass cleaner
Yeah, and I can give you a brand new one
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to Mick from dark crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just sorted me out with some some
nice bottles of of his product our crystal
[SPEAKER_01]: glass cleaner and As anyone that's watched
my show would know I'm a huge proponent
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised he actually didn't sponsor
this the Karma Cup because one of these in
[SPEAKER_01]: every thing next year Mick it might be
something you want to look at 100% All
[SPEAKER_01]: right, so Decent high on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's cerebral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is cerebral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so taste we're gonna give it a six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah medicinal effects I'd go as high as a
seven point five give it a seven go seven
[SPEAKER_01]: strength Pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not making me super uncomfortable
Visual appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a solid eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks beautiful when I cracked it open
texture Texture was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes smoothness Yeah, I didn't cough too
much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it a seven for smoothness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Residue was fairly decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there really wasn't much there
was no char whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No char So I mean residue, but we also hit
it properly true I'm sure we could have
[SPEAKER_01]: charted out had we hit a thousand degree
negative So this is where all these
[SPEAKER_01]: variables come into play if you're a hot
dabber you're dabbing everything at a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand degrees Well, you're gonna get
you know Residue that looks a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: intense than the residue that we're
getting because we're just wiping oil off
[SPEAKER_01]: of off of the banger I give it an eight
for residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way we're hitting it and
enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm Didn't make me want to go skiing or
anything, but it's a six Honestly the
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyment like like it was a decent
product, but it's not I feel I feel Like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all about strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so enjoyment for me is more than
strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm looking for focus I'm looking
for for alertness I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiration things that really make me
want to move and get up and go I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to enjoy that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I I Wouldn't continue to consume
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not what I feel like I would go
back to a lot of times So, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll give it a maybe we'll give enjoyment
of five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Which in all reality isn't all that
bad considering how snotty we are It's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting though that it could get such
high marks for the majority of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things But then enjoyment really
is unique to itself like I don't care
[SPEAKER_01]: texture and smoothness and visual appeal
Yeah are such a small part of my enjoyment
[SPEAKER_01]: so true that they could be a ten But it's
not actually giving me that inspiration
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm less likely to know no for sure I
mean like I've like you've seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: darkest like worst-looking hash ever be
the meltiest tasting stuff when you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I'm not a big fan of the
silicone.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I hate I Find it's hard to smell the
resin and silicone Yeah, it absorbs the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also leaves that white residue on some
of your resin Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely like hard to the touch
Nice little piece also flower Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say so looks like it's on its way
to butter next to your people bubble hash
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin It's definitely an added thing right
that it makes it a little harder for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people but agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll sell you the bags I'll give you
a rosin discount if that's your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose, but You want to hit that sure,
let's see what this one has to offer Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably end up doing is we'll go
through all of these different Flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to do it all on camera

expanding exponentially bringing people in
[SPEAKER_01]: exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good though It's a little bit
different in the sense that maybe you

so many years Is it for to affect people
[SPEAKER_01]: positively and these are the results of
that they are and I mean there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: growing pains You know, but that's life

accepted globally, which is It's huge.

like getting sued by the government owing
