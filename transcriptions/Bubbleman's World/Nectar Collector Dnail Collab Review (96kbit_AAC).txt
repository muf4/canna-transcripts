[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to walk you through a bit
of a product review here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting really cool things sent
to me lately from D-Nail, and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably already seen this on my channel a
few times, but I haven't actually talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is called the Nectar Collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by no means new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around for a while, and it's a
really cool concept, a different idea from
[SPEAKER_00]: a different perspective on dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nectar Collector is like a straw unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two pieces of glass that fit
together, and then you can have a tip that
[SPEAKER_00]: is also glass or quartz, I believe they
make them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you this real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little view.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it comes in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the main body, very tight here,
and then you have the mouthpiece up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are the two pieces that you
would heat up to hit your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a wax,
and I'll talk to you about that in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds here, when we actually put the
Nectar Collector together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a really cool stand,
which is definitely essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing would be a super pain in the
ass without this stand, so getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: stand with the unit is absolutely crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a safe place to keep your
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us pull out the main piece here,
Nectar Collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the three marbles there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit of water here I can put
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly don't need much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably a little bit too much
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very small amount of water
you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go about two thirds up the perk in the
center, and then just put that there for
[SPEAKER_00]: one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this piece here has a ground glass
joint that fits into here, and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you to do with this little bit of
joint wax is to just give it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a rub on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means you have to put a lot on,
but get some on, and then once you fit
[SPEAKER_00]: that in there, it kind of locks it in
good, and it actually, what it really does
[SPEAKER_00]: is it avoids it from locking it in so you
can't get out, and it just makes it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit safer, so that's definitely a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never used these yet, but we're
gonna use them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's quite a little bit finer,
one's a little bit larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go with the fine one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the joint wax probably wouldn't be
a bad idea for that guy either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of give it a little strip on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard, almost like a sex wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joint wax, probably exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little twist, and then basically
I've got a little bit of delineation
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, this rose-colored extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me actually get up there and show you
guys, because it really looks quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one on the right here is the
deliminin from Horatio, and then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left here I have a little rosin that was
made from my good friend True.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess he's from Saka Genetics now,
and I'm maybe even in the middle of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you guys posted in regards to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our unit right about away
from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting close, but it's not going in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what we're gonna do is we're
gonna... All right, so we've got the torch
[SPEAKER_00]: going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just gonna give this a little heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the idea is basically heat the
tip up and then just dip it right down
[SPEAKER_00]: into your product and slurp it up like
you're hitting a slurpee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get it out of the wind a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably don't have to hit it up much
harder than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a noob on this thing, so I'm gonna let
it sit for a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to hit it too, too hot,
but I didn't heat it up too, too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means was it glowing, so let's see
if we can't... Let's see if we can't hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: little of the deliminin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little light rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I didn't heat it up very long
with the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have gotten a much bigger,
smokier rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want real light on that because
really what I wanted to show you today was
[SPEAKER_00]: not so much that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hot, so I can pull that
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that piece, but the part that I'm
actually quite excited about and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why D-Nail sent this to me and not
Nectar Collector was... Let's get this on
[SPEAKER_00]: the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a new whip that D-Nail's
designed that goes with your Nectar
[SPEAKER_00]: Collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that guy in there real easy
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little bit of a spin,
just because it keeps it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that falling out while
you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna turn the D-Nail on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it set to around 750 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really prefer an electronic nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you from someone that
hasn't been torching much over all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big torch guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the electronic nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that when you don't have the
experience with the torch, it's harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize and know the actual temperatures
without the laser temperature guiding you
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way for all the different
surfaces from the silicone carbide,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sapphire to the ceramic,
to the quartz, to the titanium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even through the different levels of
titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course in the end, even some
people are smoking out of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these different surfaces create
different evaporation of the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different sublimation, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes the way it hits depending on
how the material holds that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the electric nail due to the fact
that it gives me an exact temperature for
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm hitting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if someone invented a torch that
had the laser sight on it telling you the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, that's a winning product,
in my opinion, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's to say that D-Nail won't be the guys
to come out with such a product?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna let that heat up for about
another 30 seconds, and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit the rosin dab that is sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I could've got a bigger,
smokier rip if I heated it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more, but I worry that I'm gonna heat it
up too much and then there's that process
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're waiting and you're wondering,
okay, do I hit it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this five to 10 second period
where you're gonna get that best hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very important to me to try and
get that hit every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down, electric nails are where it's
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is pretty darn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I got it, I was a little
bit leery of turning it upside down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the worry of this coming out was a
little bit like, oh, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna turn that upside down?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it falls out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't fallen out on me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This moves quite nicely, so as you move
the unit, it's not so tight that it can't
[SPEAKER_00]: move around and swivel, and I think we're
up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we got there, 690?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a rosin dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was a much, much nicer rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I took three times as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rosin, and it was extremely tasty
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the electricity and
you're out and about, then you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a nice little case and you're able
to pull it out and slap in one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: little glass nozzles, heat it up and have
yourself a little hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surprisingly how easy it is to hit
off of an oil slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Joshua and Christopher and
the whole team down at Oil Slick for
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a very good product for our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Cookie Sheets already existed
before, but they really brought them into
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry and bettered our industry for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat the nail up, and I haven't had one
melt on me or have any ... It actually
[SPEAKER_00]: must go up to way past 500, because the
nail itself is at 700 right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I literally drag the nail across the
top of it, and I don't feel any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I have a very high ... My old
factory, my smell and my taste are very on
[SPEAKER_00]: point, and so any time, even from leaving
hash or resin in certain containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelt the off-gassing from the
plastics and stayed away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to each their own in the end,
and I'm sure you guys will all have
[SPEAKER_00]: different comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, like I said, it's not the first
time you've seen the Nectar Collector,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to showcase it on the
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have at least one video where
if someone wanted to do a little search,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can search Bubble Man Nectar Collector
D Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a collaboration between
the three of us, because here I am using
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and it could be a collaboration
between all of you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of going to check out
dnail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's d-nail.com, and you can check them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all these different products,
and you could probably get yourself a
[SPEAKER_00]: discount if you use the code Bubble Man
425.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that is the code for May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man 425.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital B-U-B-B-L-E-M-A-N 425.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, give them a check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Nectar Collector, support D Nail,
support Whaleslake, and don't forget that
D Nail is the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
