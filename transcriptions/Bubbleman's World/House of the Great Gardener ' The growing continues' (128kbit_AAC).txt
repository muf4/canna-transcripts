[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here on a beautiful
British Columbia morning here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited to tell you that I'm on
my way to see the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I was there I wasn't even
sure if the Great Gardener's facility was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be continuing to function after
March 31st due to the unknown the
[SPEAKER_04]: injunction, not knowing whether or not it
was going to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm real excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my big screens loaded up for
Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the 250 and the 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to deseed his barb today and
then we're going to sift it and clean it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought all the different size screens
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also, which I'm quite excited about,
yesterday John and myself cut some
[SPEAKER_04]: watermelon clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember these little guys that we cut
into the clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're bringing the Great Gardener
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know he does great work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know he does great things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he should have the TGA genetics,
the watermelon and anything else that
[SPEAKER_04]: comes across my plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to share with Matt because I know
he's not going to hoard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's going to share it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even more importantly, I know he's
going to work with it and potentially add
[SPEAKER_04]: high CBD markers and other cool sort of
genetic things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So totally happy to support the Great
Gardener and bring him a little watermelon
[SPEAKER_04]: clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're pretty excited here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get going here,
jump in the truck and head down to the
[SPEAKER_04]: ferry terminal and when we're down at the
ferry terminal we'll have a little wake
[SPEAKER_04]: and bake session.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am running a little bit behind today so
not able to hit the bull before we leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you there!
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there!
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there!
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there!
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there!
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, just got to the ferry terminal
here and we've got about 25 minutes to
[SPEAKER_04]: kill.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cars are just unloading, but I think
that's actually a Bowen Island ferry
[SPEAKER_04]: they're unloading from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're going to have a little
session here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straighten this camera a tiny little bit
because I'm obsessive and impulsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright!
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have brought the product case with
the Hitman rig inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really been loving this piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to keep the plastic bag and the
Kleenex in there so it absorbs any little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of bong water that I've left over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I even brought any extra
water in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going for some dry hits today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry hits are better than no hits,
I always say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got our nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our little creme brulee torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course we have all sorts of
different bubbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to see Matt from the Great
Gardener today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suspect we start the day right with a
rip of some great gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the guy knows what he's doing when
it comes to growing the dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even making wicked fucking
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is definitely an inspiration I know to
many of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I find it so fun to go
there and bump into him and his whole
[SPEAKER_04]: crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just all really good folks up
there and they're doing good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get super excited when I get the
opportunity to go up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again that's what we're doing
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So might as well start this off right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh this is so dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even believe how dry it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like powder, powder, powder dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so get that little guy down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the baby cakes right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can give you a little bit of a
visual on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of a visual on the old baby
cakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heading over there today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to drop some clones off with Matt
and hopefully get a clone or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to getting hopefully the
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also love to get the haoma or the
afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all just such beautiful wonderful
strains that I wouldn't say no to any of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably getting myself another tent here
in the real near future after hanging out
[SPEAKER_04]: with John yesterday at My Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just loved seeing all the material,
all the tents, all the lights all set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love afghani rips through the baby
cakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got about 15 to 20 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sit here and rip bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the whole time until I realize
the guy in front of me is starting his car
[SPEAKER_04]: and driving onto the ferry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually my cue to realize that hey,
bowl man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're getting on this ferry you might
want to get on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super stoked to go dry sift today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt always has the most incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to John about this today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously it has a lot to do with the
resin that you grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start sifting the majority of
your resin you really see what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really get to see the resin uncovered,
isolated and taken from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: With some strains, particularly when
you're breeding strains, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important to know what ones are resin
production plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasty treats on the full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you soon on the ferry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's like ten thousand babylon in one
blue van wacom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chester and these small little nyanjalan.
[SPEAKER_01]: N thousand babylon in one blue van wacom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chester and these small little nyanjalan.
Diving
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning, diving in the evening,
diving late at night time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always saying that your past Cannabis
culture's growing out, it's growing real
[SPEAKER_01]: fast Down in Colorado, even California
Most of the people medically inclined
[SPEAKER_01]: Defended by the lawyer, scripted by the
doctor Seems like the people spiritually
[SPEAKER_01]: inclined And if you never yet,

And I am feeling so inclined Tell them
[SPEAKER_01]: how, don't get caught by scientific
medication The side effects that is
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying this nation Decreasing
population, increasing frustration It's
[SPEAKER_01]: okay to think about your health now Do it
by relation or broadcast to the nation The
[SPEAKER_01]: people need to know a new time has come A
time to rejuvenate, get it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate Some even seek to legalize it
right now So let me see by the show of
[SPEAKER_01]: your hand These 4 20 years, devs,

[SPEAKER_04]: right now and I am feelin' so inclined Hey
guys, Bumbleman here I am on the BC ferry
[SPEAKER_04]: heading over to beautiful Vancouver Island
You can see as I step out of the frame
[SPEAKER_04]: that the camera readjusts It's really
beautiful out there, beautiful skyline
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the zodiac boat between
Mercury's here on the Queen of Cowichan
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case we need them And yeah,
Vancouver Island in the background That's
[SPEAKER_04]: the story of Vancouver, the city of
Vancouver in the background Really sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I figured what better time than
to do some Hitman rips With Kit,
[SPEAKER_04]: with my Hitman baby cakes Got my torch,
my dabber, and my piece So, should be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to get this done As Vancouver disappears
in the background The city Sure love to
[SPEAKER_04]: take this Mercury down for a little whip
Just a little bit of zodiac boat to do a
[SPEAKER_04]: Mercury's on it That'll be fun Really
gotta give it up to Hitman and the glass
[SPEAKER_04]: that he's been releasing lately I've only
smoked a few of the pieces but from the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that I have I've been more than
impressed So props Dougie, really diggin'
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're doing Steppin' it up and yeah,
it's just nice to see
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making some announcements here on
the ferry Alright well, I say let's get to
[SPEAKER_04]: dabbing here We don't have time for
announcements all day long So we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: hit that beautiful Afghani from the House
of the Great Gardener Just about lost it
[SPEAKER_04]: there didn't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: And release ash And release ash Alright,
so just a little smidgen on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll do And a little torch action Stared
out at the ocean while I torch my mole My
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitman mole Can't
[SPEAKER_04]: wait till they make a portable D-Nail but
until they do I sure love my little Hitman
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby cakes Baby cake rips Thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: for watching
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, Bubble Man back here at the back
of the ferry Not sure if you remember last
[SPEAKER_04]: time but we tried to do this last time and
I failed miserably so I figured the only
[SPEAKER_04]: thing to do was to come back and make
another attempt So with the dab loaded
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Gardener Afghani We've got the piece
in hand And we've got the creme brulee
[SPEAKER_04]: torch in hand So let's see if we can make
this work Ooh the wind's brisk It's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: be a challenge We can get this This could
work guys
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright dab's on the back of the ferry
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked I'm happy to say that I managed
to get a hit on the back of the ferry It's
[SPEAKER_04]: been a while when you don't smoke joints
anymore You know you gotta come to the
[SPEAKER_04]: back and do what you need to do but With a
torch and a glass piece it's not that easy
[SPEAKER_04]: but Today it was So I guess I'm gonna
continue to sit here and rip bowls now
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've managed to get this working And
we'll see you guys over on Vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: Island That's some OG this morning and I'm
feeling real good I cut the pot to light
[SPEAKER_01]: it up You know I load it up good A real
Gyanja smoker and I really love to burn
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gyanja community are my first concern
I check my good friend Don has a good
[SPEAKER_01]: bread, drink wood Maritans smoking because
we good But no man loves smoke weed when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason Gyanja fi carry it
through any season I take a drop it lift
[SPEAKER_01]: me up a water bless evening Gyanja me
consider the truth And I open a make a
[SPEAKER_01]: reboot the system Somebody run to call me
name to the authority They say they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: take the smoke like you take it daily So
the Babylonians want to arrest me But tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them Gyanja's not happy that it's
necessary Too much of Gyanja man in jail
[SPEAKER_01]: job ain't gonna set them free When we're
smoking Smoking sentamania It shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: cause no bother Gyanja to the world When
we're smoking Smoking sentamania It
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't cause no bother Gyanja to the
world
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're smoking Smoking sentamania It
shouldn't cause no bother Gyanja to the
[SPEAKER_01]: world When we're smoking Smoking
sentamania It shouldn't cause no bother
[SPEAKER_01]: Gyanja to the world When we're smoking
Smoking sentamania It shouldn't cause no
[SPEAKER_01]: bother Gyanja to the world When we're
smoking Smoking sentamania It shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: cause no bother Gyanja to the world When

[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm feeling good Rise up this
morning Feeling in the mood To dab away
[SPEAKER_01]: the day Dab away the day I saw my good
friend He said to me One dab will keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor away It's all about your dabbing
too Relax and free your mood I wanna take
[SPEAKER_01]: a dab with you Because I'm feeling good
It's all about your dabbing too Relax and
[SPEAKER_01]: free your mood See I wanna dab with you
Because I'm feeling good Make way for the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate And the glass makers of today
Fire torch to the glass blaze Your
[SPEAKER_01]: troubles away Load it up, load it up Let
us burn one down And pass it around It's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about your dabbing too Relax and free
your mood I wanna take a dab with you
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm feeling good It's all about
your dabbing too Relax and free your mood
[SPEAKER_01]: See I wanna dab with you Because I'm
feeling good So if you ever take a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: before Take it easy if you know say you're
a one time beginner Take this advice from
[SPEAKER_01]: the DJ Asha Seek medical help if you don't
feel proper Then don't want them to
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribe Gyanja Because they make me
realize it's Gyanja The gift of genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe the second gift ever We've got
industrial screens Look at these screens
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured with that beautiful barb We
should get these bad boys These are
[SPEAKER_04]: different than my other screens This is a
250 micron and a 180 So it's a bigger size
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna use the dry sift wizards trick
We're gonna put all the herb gently and do
[SPEAKER_04]: a super light bounce Get like 99% pure
heads And then you can literally use the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom one The 180 for regular sifting
You've card over your 70s still You've got
[SPEAKER_04]: a 90 which is 180 micron And you've got a
60 mash lines per inch Which is 250 micron
[SPEAKER_04]: The smaller the number for lines per inch
or mash The bigger the micron number The
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger the hole So yeah let's bring these
bad boys inside and go get those barbs No
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't need it You've got the table So
you know what I'll let you take one of
[SPEAKER_04]: these Because they really are heavy And
I'll take one We'll head on up
[SPEAKER_05]: Today we will be sifting barber bud Oh
yeah This barber bud was let go for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time Just water You can see the color You
can see the purple You can see the yellow
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the crystals And it's super
dry Beautiful herb These two almost look
[SPEAKER_04]: like completely separate phenos It does
look like a different bud If it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of down and here Yeah as you get
lower you can tell it's exactly the same
[SPEAKER_04]: It must have been close to the light Holy
mox I can only imagine how much dry sift
[SPEAKER_04]: is inside these bins And this is a non
seeded?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is seeded yeah Oh it is seeded I
can't even see the seeds This is a
[SPEAKER_05]: feminized seed Beautiful Yeah they're in
there Now you've got to crush them up to
[SPEAKER_04]: get them out Do you find them?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because when all those hair Like all
these leaves dry and everything right It
[SPEAKER_05]: totally protects the bud And when you
start You start taking off these little
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves I'm going to do it over the bins
Like it's just coated It is incredible You
[SPEAKER_04]: can get really close on that too It's
quite a quality little camera For showing
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality of the resin It's unbelievable
Too often I'm working with people's
[SPEAKER_05]: material And you just don't see that This
is a resin producer But you think if
[SPEAKER_05]: people are trimming this wet That all
these crystals Get smashed, ruptured All
[SPEAKER_05]: these leaves and stuff I don't know how
many people out there throw away their
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves It's sort of more of a 90's thing
Where everybody just threw away their leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of the resin on that leaf Is
really no different than the quality of
[SPEAKER_04]: the resin Right inside the bud If you were
to turn it into hash You quickly realize
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's That's what we're growing here
for Particularly when we're calling it
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine Really nice Give us the
background on the barb one more time
[SPEAKER_05]: There's shishkeberry in there for sure
It's an old shishkeberry clone We got in
[SPEAKER_05]: London And I've had it since the mid 90's
Would that have come via NYPD?
[SPEAKER_04]: That lets me know that because it was NYPD
that had it It would have come from
[SPEAKER_04]: Breeder Steve It would have been an
original shishkeberry Either a red line
[SPEAKER_04]: There were two lines The red line and the
yellow line that were used The two
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanis that were used in the creation of
shishkeberry And both are exceptional
[SPEAKER_05]: Slightly different but still so It's
always been number one If someone makes
[SPEAKER_04]: hash out of it It's a star It is the first
bubble hash I ever made That let me know
[SPEAKER_04]: that there was something special With
these bags That these bags could do
[SPEAKER_04]: something that was special Because before
that I had seen it done a few times And I
[SPEAKER_04]: was very unimpressed with the wet Sort of
substance that came out of the one single
[SPEAKER_04]: The two single bags One work bag and one
catch bag And then Breeder Steve brought
[SPEAKER_04]: over It was the yellow line of pure
shishkeberry And when we made that into
[SPEAKER_04]: water hash It was the first time I was
like There's something here This is a real
[SPEAKER_05]: thing So in Spain too The reaction in
Spain for the barber bun was I was having
[SPEAKER_05]: people I respect come up to me And sort of
tap me on the shoulder And be like Can I
[SPEAKER_05]: try some of your dry sips?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like Of course you can You
were so generous with your dry sips I
[SPEAKER_04]: bumped into so many people They'd be like
Hey do you have any of that great gardener
[SPEAKER_04]: dry sip?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like No I don't have any And they
were like Well let me smoke a bowl of that
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have some And I'd be like That's
amazing That's awesome It was awesome I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: say honestly Five or six different people
Smoked me up With your hash In Barcelona
[SPEAKER_04]: Like apart from you Like you weren't even
around Very generous of you It's nice to
[SPEAKER_04]: give your hash away It's fun You know it's
good to share so I guess next up We're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to lay these screens down And do a
little bit of breaking up this bud So
[SPEAKER_05]: let's do it Catch up with you guys in a
bit Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like best for seeds or best for resin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh that's great for resin But when I
femmed it It was sort of a last minute
[SPEAKER_05]: thing So it didn't work as good as it
should have Alright well We're back You
[SPEAKER_04]: can hear us yapping away here We've got
the large five foot by three foot screen
[SPEAKER_04]: set up And that's going to break up some
nugget Man does that powder up amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy Christ Yeah there's some nice seeds
Feminize Barbara bud So we're doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: little light trick The quick bounce We're
basically going to break some nugs up over
[SPEAKER_04]: this Quite delicately because it's a very
large screen You don't want to really rub
[SPEAKER_04]: too much on top of the screen Because it's
a larger size We're working with a 250
[SPEAKER_04]: micron Underneath here we have a 180
micron And what we do is just the more
[SPEAKER_04]: gentle we are We want to just get the pure
heads So if we can get the pure heads
[SPEAKER_04]: We're happy
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a bin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I need a crappy bin I'll be right
back Alright Amazing resin content on
[SPEAKER_04]: these plants Like these guys are
definitely not messing around It's just
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful Reminiscent of that old school
Shishke barrier So nice It's nice to see
[SPEAKER_04]: special genetics stay around But also be
worked and bred into something more
[SPEAKER_04]: special I would gladly help you but
without gloves I'm not going to even
[SPEAKER_04]: attempt it I'll melt so much of this resin
onto my... Oh yeah you've got some over
[SPEAKER_04]: there I don't know if there's any in there
No I don't think there is I think this is
[SPEAKER_04]: like you I wouldn't even use plastic
gloves for stripping like this I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: wear the gloves because you'll get crazy
blisters Oh yeah I've been there Break
[SPEAKER_05]: them up I'm destocking like this because
it's a seed run Seeds don't mind if buds
[SPEAKER_05]: are broken up People do We can go through
it fairly quickly So we let this just hang
[SPEAKER_05]: and dry and dry It's interesting because
when you get the opportunity to let things
[SPEAKER_05]: really dry out You can play with it right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it so so dry But then you can
close the door Just let it sit And it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like it gets a little moist It gets that
sort of perfect bud consistency No you can
[SPEAKER_04]: get it too dry Most people never find out
when they're just so damn worried of
[SPEAKER_04]: selling it And getting it off the you know
and so much herb is just sold wet That
[SPEAKER_04]: there's always extremely high moisture
content This has an extremely low moisture
[SPEAKER_04]: content Yet you know some of the stalks
can still bend So that's definitely a good
[SPEAKER_04]: sign Take that off The stalk is redding
Man I'm excited to see what's under this
[SPEAKER_05]: screen I've got to say Yeah so we're going
to do this for a bin Every time So you
[SPEAKER_05]: always want to move your product gently So
then when you're doing it and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: always doing it onto the screen All of a
sudden you have a big pile of weed And
[SPEAKER_05]: you're trimming buds onto the top of the
weed Those trichome heads even though
[SPEAKER_05]: they've fallen off They have to now sort
of Navigate Yeah plink over their way down
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have a huge screen here too
So you know if you've got a big screen
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to use it If you've got
multiple people all using their own This
[SPEAKER_04]: would literally be a screen for four
people You could have two workers on that
[SPEAKER_04]: side Two workers on this side And just
working over these screens Doing exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: what he's doing This is a good chunk of
screen to do this work Or one worker
[SPEAKER_04]: Working No serious I'm not really working
am I?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a talker Come on I'm here to talk No
my work will be lifting these screens And
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing what's underneath them And then of
course dropping that onto the ceramic
[SPEAKER_04]: Little plate that D-Nail sent you What do
they call that little ceramic insert?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what it's called Have you
put it inside the time handle or you use
[SPEAKER_04]: it on top?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no I just use it on top I did that by
accident and that's how people are using
[SPEAKER_04]: them now They laughed at me They were like
what are you doing with the thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like it didn't fit in my tie
Because it's the original titanium bowls
[SPEAKER_04]: and nails It fits right in But mine was
ground down so that little piece in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle Was keeping the screen for me Oh
yeah I wanted them to grind it down and
[SPEAKER_04]: thicken the walls anyway It's how that
became to be I think it's good for
[SPEAKER_04]: photography too though Oh it makes great
photos Oh my god I put too much on one the
[SPEAKER_05]: other day and I gave it to a rookie You?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it No I gave it to one of
the rookies So he's the king of putting
[SPEAKER_06]: too much on And the guy is just like And
it's just like right down the middle I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like slowly That's where the drop down
comes in handy There's a little piece It's
[SPEAKER_04]: a little glass piece that goes up And then
goes down and then points up again And you
[SPEAKER_04]: put your bowl and the D-Nail down there
That way things that drop through don't go
[SPEAKER_04]: into the pipe They sit down in this little
chamber Which you could literally just
[SPEAKER_04]: torch later for a rip And it's hard to
watch him do this and not just be like But
[SPEAKER_04]: my hands are just from touching one The
amount of resin on those gloves even has
[SPEAKER_05]: got to be Oh totally just since I've
started Look at that Oh that's a rip Oh
[SPEAKER_04]: you're freaking me out man Just this patty
of hash on his face Oh my god Award
[SPEAKER_04]: winning Barb Right here Well you got some
more You're going to be entering some more
[SPEAKER_04]: things with Barb right here are you not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so I think we should Yeah well
absolutely I mean look at it dude Look at
[SPEAKER_05]: it We got the champ show coming up In
Toronto It's happy weed This weed makes me
[SPEAKER_05]: happy We're coming for the legends title
Legends We're coming for the experience
[SPEAKER_05]: and the good times This will be a welcome
welcome welcome addition to legends I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been thinking about it ever since the last
legends dinner You know how many people go
[SPEAKER_04]: to legends of hash dinner And while
they're sitting there they say to
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves Why didn't I bring my best
hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm standing in the hall of next year
Making my peace Hey if you haven't started
[SPEAKER_04]: making your legends entry for next year
This might be a good reminder for you that
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're coming And you want to show off
Man I'm telling you 48 hours is what you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to come to my booth And show me a
piece to acquire a ticket Because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough tickets There's 15 to 20 that
become available Maybe if more people in
[SPEAKER_04]: the scene that weren't entering Dedicated
their tickets More new people could come
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there are at least 25 people that
just come to the legends dinner Every year
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't really enter hash Most of them
are legends though The legends dinner was
[SPEAKER_05]: always about ancient legends They're
legends in people It's funny going to the
[SPEAKER_05]: legends dinner and having legends smoke
your pipe We have a pipe around here like
[SPEAKER_04]: that I had a few I ended up selling my few
Every year I'll bring one And then as I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: leaving a friend will be like You have to
sell me that pipe Everyone at legends hit
[SPEAKER_04]: that pipe and I'm like You can only keep
so many pipes in this world We got that
[SPEAKER_04]: done?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I'm just going to clear the screen
Notice how I said we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and Matt working hard I assure you I
have my place This is going to be going
[SPEAKER_05]: into your tumbler?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tumbler after this So you'll do a 10
minute?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a 10 minute then a 1 hour And
then we'll do the 24 hour Well we'll do
[SPEAKER_05]: the 1 hour And then we'll go and get the
seed out 24 hours When Matt first said
[SPEAKER_04]: that to me I was like This guy is insane
And he's spinning his material for 24
[SPEAKER_04]: hours He's not actually insane His herb is
just so much better than most people's
[SPEAKER_04]: herb That his 24 hour Which you couldn't
even run The majority of people's herb You
[SPEAKER_04]: could not run for 24 hours It would be
like lawn clippings at the end of it But
[SPEAKER_04]: you've seen what we pull out on his 24
hour Big bag of golden sift that still
[SPEAKER_04]: slightly sticks to itself Sure it's
contaminated It's been spinning for 24
[SPEAKER_04]: hours But the fact that you get the amount
that you get After already doing the 10
[SPEAKER_04]: and the 1 hour It blows my mind man I
think it really does This is THC laden
[SPEAKER_04]: herb Unadulterated cannabinoids Been
collecting them for years It goes through
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of strains to find that one
There's only a few strains Sweet skunk is
[SPEAKER_05]: one of those strains for me The warlock is
one of those strains for me The warlock
[SPEAKER_05]: has a unique smell, both of those Totally
The halma which sort of comes from the old
[SPEAKER_05]: perps And the perps smells are
extraordinary It really is just about a
[SPEAKER_04]: profile There's of course visual things
that show us different structures and
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics in the plant But it's in those
profiles The ratios of cannabinoids versus
[SPEAKER_04]: THC versus the terpenes and terpenoids and
mono-terpenoids and sesquiterpenoids You
[SPEAKER_04]: can read about all these cool things
Google it up This is the next level of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis learning People are not just
growing herb This is the messenger Well
[SPEAKER_05]: you think because of prohibition right?
[SPEAKER_05]: People grew plants for size No smell
Cannot smell These are sort of before
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon cans And you search for houses with
high chimneys Or you search for a house
[SPEAKER_04]: The best house we ever found was on the
train tracks And right where the train
[SPEAKER_04]: came around on this property It gave it a
big boost of power It shot out a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of diesel up there On top of the
stack So it was just perfect for the
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel generator That was also 24-7
pumping out diesel smoke To just have this
[SPEAKER_04]: train doing it like 6 times a day or
something And I remember growers so mad
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you gave them a stinky strain Oh
of course Oh my god man that plant is so
[SPEAKER_04]: stinky It defoked your problem man It's
like oh sorry I didn't know That's so true
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's probably one of the reasons
why only the few seem to have the ability
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny that this would even still
be connected You know the barb has
[SPEAKER_04]: shishkeberry in it That shishkeberry came
from Steve Steve and Matt to me remind me
[SPEAKER_04]: of one another In one sense that they both
recognize quality They both don't just
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke joints They know what full melt
resin is They know the grades and the
[SPEAKER_04]: levels And from all the breeders I've met
over the years The ones that recognize the
[SPEAKER_04]: qualities of the resin To me seem to be
the ones that have better luck in
[SPEAKER_04]: producing strains Go figure that produce
melty resin For sure You just can't figure
[SPEAKER_05]: that out And then because of the clubs And
then you get to see that those same smelly
[SPEAKER_05]: plants Are the same plants that people in
the clubs Are using to feel better right
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's something to the
synergistic smells and flavors that go
[SPEAKER_05]: along with the high or the pain relief or
the Oh I just accidentally dropped that
[SPEAKER_05]: big oops I did it again Oh no we're not
done one bin We're not done one bin We
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't empty it out It's so reminiscent
too of that old-school lime but You know
[SPEAKER_04]: the light colored herb It puts a smile on
my face I'm definitely going to do some
[SPEAKER_04]: macro photography for you guys here Get a
little bit of the resin on the plant I've
[SPEAKER_04]: pulled a few buds aside here that I'll
shoot for you to show you the quality of
[SPEAKER_04]: the resin and how intact it is This dry is
still on the plant So how long did you
[SPEAKER_04]: hang and dry this for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Three weeks It hung for a week It sat in a
bin or it hung for two weeks and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: sat in a bin for a couple days and then we
opened the lid and just We stuck it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: one room that was warm I would suggest
also to crisp it up right before we The
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that you're leaving the stock on is
huge The people think that they can do
[SPEAKER_04]: this by taking the buds off the stock your
bud will get way Dryer so realize that if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to copy him and Come out with
the same results make sure that you leave
[SPEAKER_04]: your plant on the stick The stock is super
key because it holds moisture just the
[SPEAKER_04]: right amount in the inside the cellulose
of the stock and just hold that perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of moisture so that your buds don't
Don't literally turn to dust because as
[SPEAKER_04]: violent as he's being there's still bud
here in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah And many many seeds so these seeds
will be available at the house of the
[SPEAKER_04]: great gardener.com No, we don't sell seeds
on our site.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get them at vancouverseedbank.ca
Sacred herb which just started carrying
[SPEAKER_05]: our seeds which is a huge thing Ian Hunter
back in the day he opened that store to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell seeds and he got busted for it and
they haven't sold seeds since so It's good
[SPEAKER_05]: to Know that the old school so sacred herb
Vancouver seed bank two perfect options if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're looking for Working on the house of
the great gardener dot UK So we're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: and what oh did we enter into the European
scene?

[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play Russian pool?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not play Russian pool, but what
happened to me is I got sucked into the
[SPEAKER_04]: back room and Photograph buds and hash for
two and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah So all my friends were like,

Wanted to get this on video because Matt
[SPEAKER_04]: is about to gift me something I was gifted
years ago But was unable to hold on to it
[SPEAKER_04]: gave it to a friend who ended up losing it
due to the loss Oh man, so happy to be
[SPEAKER_04]: receiving this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the infamous sweet skunk a
Favorite by many people that don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a favorite people that don't even
smoke Cannabis will have a hit of sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally like the salmon of herb now
people don't like fish, but they'll eat
[SPEAKER_04]: salmon That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a great Just unique profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be I have an island sweet skunk
that I sort of have like three generations
[SPEAKER_05]: of It had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could find it and but it's nothing like
this does and this one was gifted to me by
[SPEAKER_05]: a good friend and So keep it in the family
and make sure everybody has it because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's got to stay alive and Preserving
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see legends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is really cool It's incredible
how it is literally like a bonsai plant
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it almost looks like a bamboo or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cut is Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we just kept it under fluorescence
and just kept it on the back burner So it
[SPEAKER_05]: was like this tall and you just sort of
cut it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Totally keep bonsai down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah House of the great gardener man
preserving genetics breeding growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting the community in a way that I
can only give two thumbs up to so Two
[SPEAKER_04]: thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're back It's been hard getting
Matt to not like touch the resin on the
[SPEAKER_04]: screen because he's so like on autopilot
He wants to card up all the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a different process.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing we can card that up later So
we're gonna take this we're gonna gently
[SPEAKER_04]: put it over there Yeah, put it down gently
because there's obviously still Resin to
[SPEAKER_04]: fall through there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like look at that, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen anything like that That's
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now we need to lift this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and put it right here This whole
thing I just want to look at that already
[SPEAKER_04]: like here bring the camera over here and
we'll show the Yeah, absolutely good call
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna take mine off That's incredible
the quality of that So much fell breaking
[SPEAKER_04]: it up, yeah, so let's see what managed to
fall through below that So
[SPEAKER_04]: this right here Should be very very very
very very pure Pure than normal Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: now this looks like it's a the right
texture as well Always doing things on a
[SPEAKER_04]: different level with the great gardener
I've heard that resin up slower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see just in the corner here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful color on this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely golden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm suspecting under the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be Damn near pure heads So
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a nice amount to get for a first
little run Quality looks Really high so
[SPEAKER_04]: melts right into a liquid just in your
fingers I got just a little piece there
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's It's gummy and melty Looks to be
I'd say 99% pure heads just from the way
[SPEAKER_04]: it's glistening and diamond like but I'll
get my macro lens out and I'll photograph
[SPEAKER_04]: this and We still have one more trick to
do to get a second grade and then I guess
[SPEAKER_04]: really we're gonna get a third grade
What's left on top of this screen or we
[SPEAKER_04]: could card it through as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a always a pleasure working with
Yeah, look at that quality even what's
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting on top here is Incredible There's
like random little red hairs and then
[SPEAKER_04]: that's it everything else is just gold
Great to know when you use the right
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and use the right tools that you
can get some pretty great results So we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: wait for the great gardener to get back up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll show them this last little second
grade trick that we're gonna do Just for a
[SPEAKER_04]: quick quick run, you know I Know that's
not I bet you that's 99% heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna photograph it with my macro lens
But even the quality on this is
[SPEAKER_04]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to do the second trick 99%
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it together Yeah, we'll give it a
one Two three, I usually do one in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle, but I would suggest we don't yeah
Perfect I almost didn't even move in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know so let's bring this back over to
our original pile That was from a flick
[SPEAKER_05]: flick This is the flick number one We're
gonna have too many jars in the fridge and
[SPEAKER_05]: freezer Microplane sieve dry sift Micron
size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's true on top of the screen It's
catching a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of the I have a room
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cold I think that's a pretty darn
good idea and I'm gonna make it with these
[SPEAKER_05]: put these in there Somehow we should get a
hinge on it or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool hydraulic hinge
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I brought you bubble bags This
time I felt like for the quality of resin
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're producing and stuff I mean,
I love the idea that you homemade your
[SPEAKER_04]: screens and stuff that you need a
professional version of screens These
[SPEAKER_04]: screens are just so tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a special machine ours are like Yeah
And I mean it's not like we're done now
[SPEAKER_04]: we've gotten a first grade over there a
second grade over here wherever we decide
[SPEAKER_04]: to card this up is a third grade and I
would suspect whatever falls through will
[SPEAKER_04]: once again be another At what point does
it stop melting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly with the barber bud never
know exactly And then you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's when you always want to double
stack the screens because it'll it'll
[SPEAKER_04]: collect this This is what you would have
collected on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like But you managed to pull
these little like a couple of grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: heads out on either pile you pulled them
out It's almost like you further refined.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to clean This has to be
cleaned but now you can literally get like
[SPEAKER_04]: quality of resin like what I was cleaning
for you With just like a single bounce
[SPEAKER_04]: without the secret without the secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different secret secret Sam secret
recipe or a secret technique stays a
[SPEAKER_04]: secret Well, I mean until we still make
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well card is allowed us to do that This
allows us to do that and of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Sam's technique still will always
have its place because You know when guys
[SPEAKER_04]: have like large amounts of it that they
want cleaned That's it I was just had a
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation about sort of dry sift and
getting dry sift to the point where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like this and then they're saying like how
much is that worth and you're like You
[SPEAKER_05]: know, what are you comparing it to are you
comparing it to the 20%?
[SPEAKER_05]: The 20 25% of the BHO guys are getting or
the 10 to 15% That the ice guys are doing
[SPEAKER_05]: when you get to this stuff And you're
pulling out like it's a 1% one like 1% 1%
[SPEAKER_05]: out of all the sit to put a value on it is
really where a prohibition Comes into play
[SPEAKER_05]: because because of prohibition you can't
grow enough of it to make true quality
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine That is deserved like this is the
stuff people should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course not the plants what the plants
it has their place Well, the plants bring
[SPEAKER_04]: us to the resin, you know, and they're
definitely like I would never want to take
[SPEAKER_04]: away whole plant medicine from anyone But
I would hope that anyone would never try
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep you know This on a daily available
basis Would take an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you just see the amount of
cannabis we used to break up over that
[SPEAKER_04]: screen?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure many of you were like,
oh my god, and you know, it's not like
[SPEAKER_04]: we've wasted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a ton of Resin still on that
bud still on the screens, but when you
[SPEAKER_04]: break it down to the small pile of the
pure heads It is beyond rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go try the seconds Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to lift up and bring the first
with us as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't just you can't just grab
the second We're gonna go back You could
[SPEAKER_04]: probably get away with flicking it
multiple times because you have so much
[SPEAKER_04]: resin on there and It's yeah, you can tell
this is a different grade It's a tinge of
[SPEAKER_04]: green that we're not getting here now,
it's not that this is contaminated they're
[SPEAKER_04]: different heads You know which definitely
makes them a little less Picks up nice off
[SPEAKER_04]: of the All ahead nice fresh poly fresh
poly
[SPEAKER_04]: Snake ready for the D now risen like this
you can put it on the card and Leave it
[SPEAKER_04]: for all of a minute And it'll gum up and
harden up and make it a lot safer for us
[SPEAKER_04]: to move that from here to downstairs where
we're gonna go hit that D now Because
[SPEAKER_04]: after all that time of growing beautiful
cannabis and hanging it and putting it in
[SPEAKER_04]: the drum the bins and flipping it and then
Bring it over the screen and deep stocking
[SPEAKER_04]: it and collecting the resin the way we
collected it To drop it is an abso fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: loot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a faux pas beyond faux pas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was amazing You just dropped a tiny
little drop of it and it exploded when it
[SPEAKER_04]: landed as we're talking about dropping it
But hey you dropped it where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to drop it Oh, yeah, that's
listen dropping it on the table is one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing dropping it on the wood stairs
That's a no-go So yeah, let's head
[SPEAKER_04]: downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hit some of these bowls I love
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you If thanks for the morning rise
