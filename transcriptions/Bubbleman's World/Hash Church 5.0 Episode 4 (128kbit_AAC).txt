[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Dave.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna actually try right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we can't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we can't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's being sent to a live stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be great if it worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be great if it worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally figured it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot believe I finally figured this
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, welcome everybody to Hash Church 5.0
episode four.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this might be one of the first
times that it's actually gone live on the
[SPEAKER_09]: screen that I created in YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: A week ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to Thomas from Grandmaster
LED who helped me organize.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, John Maddox, it worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all thanks to Thomas from
Grandmaster LED who kind of walked me
[SPEAKER_09]: through it the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you that don't know what I'm
talking about, we usually create a live
[SPEAKER_09]: video on YouTube a week before the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what happens is that when I go live,
it almost always creates a different link.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the people that are waiting in the
room have to move and we have to go to
[SPEAKER_09]: another room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And today we didn't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me and Skunkman Sam in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the two of us for now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we got a decent show happening
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a couple of new folks that are
gonna be coming in for the conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a great show last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you that haven't noticed,
I am broken in a big way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have broken my class.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in a big vehicle about four days
ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was skateboarding at the Skateboard Park
in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was my son's 10th birthday and I was
having a blast just ripping around the
[SPEAKER_09]: skate park.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I came down a real steep embankment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came around the corner and I was flying
and I hit a rock and that rock utterly and
[SPEAKER_09]: completely crushed me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna mute you there real quick,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: That rock actually just stopped me dead.
[SPEAKER_09]: I flew off my skateboard 10 to 15 feet
into the air and I landed on my shoulder
[SPEAKER_09]: quite hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the equivalent of like your
good buddy hitting you with a bat at about
[SPEAKER_09]: 70%.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I've got a broken clavicle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So nothing shall stop us here at Hash
Church, nor rain, nor shine, nor broken
[SPEAKER_09]: clavicle.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, that's what happens to Mojave.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: I broke my toe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you did this in the last week?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you do it on August 27th?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure it was not nearly as fun as
how you broke your clavicle.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I just actually kicked the
freaking baseboard, goofing around with my
[SPEAKER_17]: son.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was also playing with my son at the
Whistler skate park.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's his 10th birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Him and his buddies are all on scooters
and I'm skateboarding.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I hit a rock going a super high
speed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It made that sound.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I flew.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I landed, I just remember like
the most insane sound.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how I knew I was hurt before I knew I
was hurt, because the adrenaline pumps
[SPEAKER_09]: through your body so fast, was when I
heard all the 20-somethings in the skate
[SPEAKER_09]: park, like at least 15 of them go.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I heard that, I was like,
oh, that was probably bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so 20 minutes later, I'm at
world-class hospital, top trauma people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a tank of nitrous oxide with my own
regulator.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just sucking on that nitrous oxide,
because I told them I don't take the
[SPEAKER_09]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hypermetabolize those things and they
make me feel really, really sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to admit, it was neat to take
nitrous oxide, not like at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't make me dizzy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually any of that stuff just makes me
feel weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wasn't on a psychedelic,
so it was the first time I think I'd ever
[SPEAKER_09]: tried nitrous, not tripping balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it was what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Both you and I are broken today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a gravity event?
[SPEAKER_09]: A gravity event?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have a gravity event.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a major gravity event.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me tell you, for those people that
don't believe in gravity, it's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can assure you, it is real.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it hurts when you fall down like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never broken a clavicle.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've broken most of my fingers,
my wrists, my arm, both my ankles,
[SPEAKER_09]: my cossacks, my collarbone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably missing a couple that I can't
really remember, but I believe this was my
[SPEAKER_09]: 17th bone I broke at 51 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, skateboarding, snowboarding,
dirt biking, downhill mountain biking,
[SPEAKER_09]: just being an all around maniac for most
of my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome Skunkman Sam and Mojave and
Etienne and Colin and whoever iPhone 64 is
[SPEAKER_09]: about to enter.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably our new guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't know anyone else that
comes in on a phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_09]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're sitting right there with the black
screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will get well soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as bad as a broken collarbone.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was five weeks of immobility.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not so bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty bad, but not as bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough of talking about my broken
bone.
[SPEAKER_04]: iPhone 64, is that egg or is that you,
Masonic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning how to use this real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, homie?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, G?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to have you on, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: All broken up, but we've already been
through that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now it's probably about starting to hit
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me tell you about the pain
reducing benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You really feel it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you crush yourself and get hurt.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Wade was talking about that
either last week or the week before,
[SPEAKER_09]: spending so much of his life really
preparing cannabis for people who really
[SPEAKER_09]: need it, but being on the other side of
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that he said something like,
I feel blessed that I'm now on this side
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm able to use cannabis and see it
from a really firsthand point when you get
[SPEAKER_09]: something serious like Wade has.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, obviously we've been preaching it,
but when you get into it, even my wife was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, are those gummies really helping
you?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, unbelievably so.
[SPEAKER_09]: No Tylenol, no Advil, no Tylenol threes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just cannabis wonderfulness.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: This really works.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a THCA bomb and a friend of mine
makes it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm a skeptic about everything in
life.
[SPEAKER_17]: I like to know, but this stuff really
works.
[SPEAKER_17]: And for a while I was like, oh,
my buddy gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I rub it on my elbow,
of course I'm going to think good stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good thoughts and feel happy emotions and
cure my little pains.
[SPEAKER_17]: But after doing this for a while,
this THCA with some other little stuff and
[SPEAKER_17]: amazing pain relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that some of the topicals at high
dose milligrams, like 7,000 cbd,
[SPEAKER_04]: 7,000 milligrams cbd 7,200 really actually
helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm denying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: That brings up a problem because agreed
medicinal dosage is a higher dosage.
[SPEAKER_19]: And your state side, we're limiting
dosage, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because at least here in California,
you're limited to 100 milligrams dosage
[SPEAKER_19]: per, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so since 2018, it's been a problem for
my serious medical patients to find
[SPEAKER_19]: quality high dosage products.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because of exactly what you stated,
Marcus, I broke something.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need something now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can get that, Marcus, and I'm glad
you can.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad you're able to find dosages that
work.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is a conundrum on the ground for
the individual patients still that we are
[SPEAKER_19]: unable to get the medicine needed
depending on the legislation within the
[SPEAKER_19]: state.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that way in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, we obviously have a weird
thing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got this federal legalization thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a medical patient,
there's sort of access.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, when it was only medical and
everyone was hiding behind it to protect
[SPEAKER_09]: their grows, I'm not judging.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that's what was happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was more accessible.
[SPEAKER_09]: The minute recreational came in,
all of the medical people just jumped into
[SPEAKER_05]: my message.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just try not to make you real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not accessible here either.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, 10 milligrams is the limit that
you can get in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you can go to a rec store and buy a
gram of live resin or live rosin or
[SPEAKER_09]: distillate for anywhere from probably $15
to $30.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have a little bit of knowledge,
you can go buy extracts and crockpotted in
[SPEAKER_09]: your own MCT or coconut oil or whatever
else you're choosing as a carrier.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's unacceptable for patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if you were like, oh, well,
you can buy insulin, but you actually have
[SPEAKER_09]: to prepare it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to prepare your insulin
before it's actually usable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a little unreasonable here still
as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm truly a 10 milligram guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm hurt, I'll probably take four or
five of those in a day, which is still
[SPEAKER_09]: only 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas my homie Thomas from Grandmaster
LED, he took 2400 milligrams on the plane
[SPEAKER_09]: ride the last time I went to Germany with
him and didn't die.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't a zombie, wasn't blubbering and
slobbering and was completely 100%
[SPEAKER_09]: present.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we all also have different
metabolization rates.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all are affected by cannabinoids
differently.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I do feel for the patients that
have that slow metabolization like Thomas
[SPEAKER_09]: and really requires large doses.
[SPEAKER_09]: To not have it be available is a pretty
big bummer for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I have a high tolerance to THC as
well, edible.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like, and I make my own for that
reason because I don't wanna ingest so
[SPEAKER_17]: much sugar.
[SPEAKER_17]: When it's just like someone gave me a
drink and they're like 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_17]: drinks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, man, I have to drink five of
these.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's insane.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or if they're gummies or whatever,
it's like, I have to drink, eat all these.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, just give me a therapeutic dose
in an edible form though.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to- No, I shout out White Rabbit
because it's a local company here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bumped into them a while ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude Dave was just at an event I went to
called the collector's cup and he was way
[SPEAKER_09]: off in the corner and he was giving away
gummies and they were like the square
[SPEAKER_09]: gummies and they kind of had the little
bit of cane sugar on them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd seen this style before,
but when I tasted his, he had like
[SPEAKER_09]: habanero mango and banana maca.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he had an actual formulator working
with his company that was actually
[SPEAKER_09]: producing these flavor profiles based on
the flavor profiles of the volatile
[SPEAKER_09]: organic compounds that were present in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought this is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: No real sugar, a tiny little bit of cane
sugar.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was sweetening them with brown rice
syrup.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were all vegan.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were all just like incredible,
like the quality and the caliber.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought, well, this is a good idea
to make this available.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's other gummies on the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was taking these pearls for a while,
but it's sugar, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're consistently taking these
things and you're doing it sort of for the
[SPEAKER_09]: benefit of your health, it probably
doesn't take much to figure out that
[SPEAKER_09]: consuming sugar on a daily basis,
any extra considering they put it in your
[SPEAKER_09]: bread and all your condiments and just
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: To consume a low amount of sugar is truly
to be a conscious human being in today's
[SPEAKER_09]: day and age because it is difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a guy the other day and I don't
think we have these up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a Dunkin Donuts and he got this
pumpkin latte spice thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a big milkshake.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this thing had 185 grams of fucking
sugar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this is like diabetes all day long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that we're getting to the point
where people are starting to realize that
[SPEAKER_09]: type three diabetes is dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the loss of access to your
memories.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as they put that connection and I
think it was, I don't know if it was
[SPEAKER_09]: Huberman or one of these other podcast
medical guys that was the first person I
[SPEAKER_09]: saw mention that.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was actually the dude that turned
Dana White's health around.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's another kind of online doctor dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, no, that can't be true.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more and more I searched it,
the more and more I realized, yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: like almost every country in the world
associates type three diabetes with
[SPEAKER_09]: dementia and Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_09]: North America is kind of the only
countries that don't associate it as that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know this has a special place in your
heart, Colin, as you have a loved one
[SPEAKER_09]: suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just peek the sugar out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Parkinson's really is the main focus
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the other, dementia is setting in
slowly, but it's interesting when you've
[SPEAKER_04]: seen a healthy person go through a
neurological disease and then all this
[SPEAKER_04]: other constituents start to cave in on it
and seeing cannabinoids in the mix on that
[SPEAKER_04]: at high doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're seeing I'm seeing things
that I can't explain, like full stop on
[SPEAKER_04]: tremors, being able to talk better,
better use of their muscles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all over, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think just better
product, to your point, ATN is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just needed, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just in a weird modality right now
where everyone's like, it's not just that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's exactly what you're talking about
that scene.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just high dosage.
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the earlier things we learned in
the medical community here in California
[SPEAKER_19]: was that, again, all of our products were
made by patients because of their medical
[SPEAKER_19]: needs.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had SUCA, we had various types of
natural sugar products available,
[SPEAKER_19]: low glycemic, all kinds of different
things that people were making.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, due to the legalization
here in California, we lost almost 99
[SPEAKER_19]: percent of all those products and product
lines because they could not make that
[SPEAKER_19]: leap.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what you're talking about
dietarily, especially due to sugar,
[SPEAKER_19]: is a huge problem and conundrum,
as you said, because what's the most easy
[SPEAKER_19]: to find product on the market?
[SPEAKER_19]: But gummies, gummies are everywhere and
every gummy has sugar in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If not, then it has the fake sugars.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we know those fake sugars are a huge
problem, depending on your disease and et
[SPEAKER_19]: cetera, what you're going through.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we know if you have cancers and things
like that, you should be avoiding sugars
[SPEAKER_19]: altogether, you know, outright,
because sugar helps feed those cancers
[SPEAKER_19]: depending on the type of cancer,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, proper dietary choices,
just having non-sugar choices that are
[SPEAKER_19]: healthy, where are they?
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they accessible to you?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they're not accessible to me so
much as they used to be.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's a huge conundrum one high.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've just found out I'm stage four and the
only thing available to me is all sugar
[SPEAKER_19]: products.
[SPEAKER_19]: So consumers watching, you need to talk to
manufacturers and demand these things.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why we carried them originally when
we realized, oh, I'm diabetic and I need
[SPEAKER_19]: this type of product because there's no
other type of product on the market for
[SPEAKER_19]: me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't know it, then create it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have something that works for you,
that's why a lot of these product
[SPEAKER_19]: manufacturers started off.
[SPEAKER_19]: They realized I don't have access.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to create it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now that I have created it,
now I have to manufacture it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it goes back to what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the, you know, you have to be a
super fan and also really connected to the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant to understand that need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that it's, you know, we talk about
this a lot in music where the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: basically sold the catalogs to these
streaming services for equitable positions
[SPEAKER_04]: in those companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way they get paid is through
the streaming, which gives them better
[SPEAKER_04]: equitable positions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's almost the same situation in
cannabis where people like us who really
[SPEAKER_04]: care, connected to it are not in positions
more often than not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in positions to make these
products because those people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: making those products don't have the same
connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand the same need of
paying patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at profit and loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at patient needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then whatever else comes after it can
even be taken further back in the sense,
[SPEAKER_09]: Colin, and I like the way you've pivoted
this because it's not just the products.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just the creation of the
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really why we invited Masonic into
the room today.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's why we wanted to talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the bottom line is,
is that these companies that would want to
[SPEAKER_09]: control this and create these products and
bring them to market and stabilize and
[SPEAKER_09]: sell themselves, all of these different
things, they don't have the connection to
[SPEAKER_09]: the production and the creation of these
unique volatile organic compound profiles,
[SPEAKER_09]: these unique cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although a lot is THCA, I will admit,
even when we made cultivars that had CBC
[SPEAKER_09]: and THCV and CBGA and all of these other
cannabinoids, most people in the dabbing
[SPEAKER_09]: world anyway, just thought it was weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a weird texture.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBGA in particular is a weird texture.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a big dabber and you start
dabbing that, you'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is waxy and weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I like this very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the bottom line is, is when you look
at all of these incredible cultivars that
[SPEAKER_09]: have been produced, and I remember Wendy
Turner, what's her son's name?
[SPEAKER_09]: How am I spacing on his name right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Crohn's disease, Colton, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Colton Turner.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when she came in and she was like,
I thank you guys, because I said,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're such a middle American mom,
like you must look at us like we're a
[SPEAKER_09]: bunch of hippies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's like, I love you guys more than
you'll ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were the keepers of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were the ones that kept these
plants alive all of these years so that
[SPEAKER_09]: Colton could come along, learn about this,
gain access to plants and be able to turn
[SPEAKER_09]: his Crohn's around in a way that we had
never seen before.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's this connection of the roots of
the people who like Skunk Man Sam,
[SPEAKER_09]: who traveled to all these hash producing
countries, who planted these insane amount
[SPEAKER_09]: of seeds, who collected these incredible
cultivars in order to use as breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we've gone down so many
generations and there's people like
[SPEAKER_09]: Masonic and there's people like Flux and
Ramon and all of these incredible people
[SPEAKER_09]: that are just keeping this work alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that is the basis of all of
everything that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the most important factor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of what we're going to be
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Feno hunting and breeding and how
selection is done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that how Sam did it is probably
very different from how people are doing
[SPEAKER_09]: it now with populations being so
decreased.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are doing incredible work
really in like their homes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, whereas Sam was doing incredible
work in fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I kind of just want to open up that
discussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome Masonic to be speaking about this
with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you've had some incredible lines,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that some of the cultivars that
you've produced have created just some
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely insane hashes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really stoked to have you here
today and stoked to maybe have you tell us
[SPEAKER_09]: a little bit about kind of how you got
into this and where your specialty lies in
[SPEAKER_09]: regards to how you choose your breeding
stock and how you choose your phenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing I want to say about
Masonic is, you know, we met a few years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago in person and we really kind of
connected on this concept of the love of
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started talking about music.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, one thing I noticed about
Edgar and Masonic is that he doesn't need
[SPEAKER_04]: his permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does what he feels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of the spirit of
everyone here on the panel is like what we
[SPEAKER_04]: came up in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was we were drawn to this in a way
that was it was it was bigger than us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're you're continuing that that
spirit in a way that allows you to connect
[SPEAKER_04]: with culture, make friends and build your
own little culture around that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's to me, that's that's what it's
all about, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's that's it's great to
see you so connected and just loving what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like his genuine love that I see,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just he's working with
Shiska Barry Marcus again and to hear like
[SPEAKER_04]: that come up as a varietal 25 years
removed from when we touched it and had
[SPEAKER_04]: good success with it is amazing and kind
of brings a full circle for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you'd be great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that this morning, dude,
and it made me talk about all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just tell us about it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to just kind of get that bit
in there to give you give the viewers you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, the color that, you know,
you're doing your thing through passion,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: For starters, for letting me be a part of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was on here before,
but it's night and day, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, from last time I was here,
I feel as far as headspace.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I I I started smoking weed like
everybody I'd imagined, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we love smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next thing you know, I ran out of this
really quality bag of weed that I had got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one high school summer when I
graduated, my father gave me a pound of
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel and I lost that pound of sour
diesel because I wasn't necessarily the
[SPEAKER_03]: best hustler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more so a consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, next thing you know,
the things gone and I'm like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do we get this going again?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I'm going to start growing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started like from like I'm 18 years
old and then I'm probably growing for like
[SPEAKER_03]: till, you know, just growing, pumping out
the yard to like 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I knew was I didn't know anything
about like, you know, males and females
[SPEAKER_03]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I knew was kill the ones that are
males and leave all the girls and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I did for like six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I opened, you know, I found out
about forums and little forums like never
[SPEAKER_03]: got into any of them, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go look into it and I would just
look away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, no, that's too much for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm just go back to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remedial landscape, you know, and I would
just do my do my gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I blow up the garden to the best of my
ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 2016 came along and that's when I
finally opened up Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't through the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't through anything else that I
seen this big world of growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's just a bunch of people
that are growing and they're open about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even around that time,
people were still kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: do we show this off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we not show this off on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people to take amuse from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started just imitating the greats
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the breeding kind of came
because I had tools like I had a Tropicana
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry pie tangy before Tropicana F2 was
invented, which was one of the better hash
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was growing that Tropicana on
Instagram and people were taking notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't necessarily know what I had at
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was associating with people that
vibed with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they gave me tools to help me in my
journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unknowingly, that was Bloom at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I'm just like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already in good graces of Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still am to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my, you know, first mentors,
first person that ever gave me seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the guy behind Papaya,
Tropicana, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had gave me the precursors to the
Tropicana F2 wave and I'm growing them and
[SPEAKER_03]: people are taking notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got something cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even noticed at the time, Jungle Boys
was growing the same seed stock variety
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm on the right path, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And straight seeds got made with those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like very transparent about my
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I show everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, look, there's freaking,
you know, this got hit by a random male
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are like, I'll take one,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be like, here, I send it to a
person around the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep in mind, I've been growing for
like six years, just blowing up the
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard, blowing up the backyard,
filling up the garage, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: breaking down all the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would blast a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since 2012, I was open blasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might've done a little five gallon
bucket wash here and there, but it like
[SPEAKER_03]: the squeeze wasn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, nah, like let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just keep blasting it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did open blasting for a very
long time, like 2012 till like I started
[SPEAKER_03]: till I reached Instagram and back to the
Tropicana cherry pie tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seeds got made.
[SPEAKER_03]: People started inquiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started kind of like liking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that is that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of like, you know,
part of that plant is in this seed stock,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I always kept seeds from straight
plants anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was always the thing that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this time it was like people were
inquiring and then I had a male and even
[SPEAKER_03]: then I wasn't convinced yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, nah, I don't want to make
seeds yet because I have to blast all this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff to make like anything worth it,
you know, in order to even consume it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I would smoke my own weed and I just
had enough to make a nickel and dime on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Compton Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would literally sell my weed on Central
in downtown LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would literally go to the shadiest
places to go sell my shatter that I made
[SPEAKER_03]: with my open nug run.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm bouncing back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a male and I advertised it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yo, who wants this male?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to like, it's the Tropicana
cherry pie tangy male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody raised their hand almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave them the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not thinking about breeding or making
seeds though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still like, oh, we're like pumping out
these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking nice pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm growing a bunch of papaya fems maybe
at the time, cause that's what was out at
[SPEAKER_03]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, you know, being a team
player, you know, I'm not breeding with
[SPEAKER_03]: all the tools that are just given to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just growing plants to grow plants and
I'm smoking it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, a whole flower cycle
later from that male given to the dude
[SPEAKER_03]: that I gave it to, he comes back to me and
he's like, yo, I got these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, you do have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like you do have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost immediately I tell all of
Instagram, yo, Instagram, I have plush
[SPEAKER_03]: berry Tropicana cherry pie tangy and agent
orange Tropicana cherry pie tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were like, I'll take two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think this is what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like this is make, this is worth
the squeeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like apparently I have a calling and
that's, that's when I went to Chalice that
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met Bloom in person because all had,
all this was done online, all these seed
[SPEAKER_03]: trends, you know, seed gatherings were
done via mail online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, I'm all like, oh, they're in
town.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in Atalanto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like two and a half hours away in
Compton.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make it over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made it over there and I met Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when he gave me the next five
tools that I was going to use in my
[SPEAKER_03]: journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scratch that, that I was growing papaya at
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no way I was, because that's when he
gave me, you know, papaya punch,
[SPEAKER_03]: banana OG papaya, fabuloso papaya,
which is arcades fabuloso.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, he's, he's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was three chem,
which is from top dog cross to papaya as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one more dosito papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were the five tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also gave me the Tropicana F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had those six tools, took those home,
grew those out to grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm still growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not breeding yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a nice Tropicana F2 male
and I had all these nice papaya
[SPEAKER_03]: selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something told me, like I hit a hairy
palms almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Hey, can I make seeds with
these?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time that I'm going to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, dude, rock that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when Wilson was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's banana OG papaya Tropicana F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything just kind of just natural
organically with the good graces of the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then kind of just being a team player,
you know, and that's how Wilson was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was somewhere around like 17,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love to hear the story of how Wilson was
born.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how you got called into it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's so many different ways
to, to feel the pull and, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, kind of like Colin was saying,
you don't have to, you know, just go do
[SPEAKER_09]: your thing, you know, follow your journey
and let that journey lead you towards it's
[SPEAKER_09]: these people who have this obsession.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I've noticed is, and I don't know if
we share like a heightened olfactory or if
[SPEAKER_09]: it's just this utter and complete passion
and love of cannabis that just,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, just leads you down this
pathway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't fight it, it's,
it can be absolutely incredible,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I feel like everyone here on the
panel has not fought it and has sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: followed that pathway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all kind of ended up in different
places and we all look up to each other
[SPEAKER_09]: for different aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, dude, that is a, that's a great
story.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bill recognizes real, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: We, we see people with passion,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Others who taught us saw their passion in
us.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they lifted us up, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's our responsibility.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why we volunteer our time here
at Hash Church to spread and teach,
[SPEAKER_19]: because we were taught many of us for free
with the only expense being pay it forward
[SPEAKER_19]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're very fortunate to have the
ability and the freedom now to speak
[SPEAKER_19]: because all of us used to hide
underground, just like you were talking
[SPEAKER_19]: about.
[SPEAKER_19]: You had to go find your people and they
had to absorb you and trust you.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to build that trust.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is something we were all forced
to do because it used to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that was another camaraderie that
we used to, you know, rally around.
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to only hire activists because we
were expecting to get arrested every day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I don't have to do that because,
you know, we've changed and the things
[SPEAKER_19]: shifted.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you're carrying on the noble and I
consider the growers, the most noblest of
[SPEAKER_19]: them, all of us, because you've the ones
that have been perpetuating.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're the ones who've been taking the
risks.
[SPEAKER_19]: You are dealing with the risks of how you
grow, where you grow and what you grow to
[SPEAKER_19]: keep it safe, clean and proper.
[SPEAKER_19]: And me and my patients all appreciate
everything and all the risks that you've
[SPEAKER_19]: taken, nothing but love and great respect
to all you growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And shout out, shout out to Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that post you made today in Masonic
and I put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that was the birth of bubble
bags, the Shishkeberry, because I had
[SPEAKER_09]: tried the isolator bags, the two-bag
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wasn't, I wasn't stoked.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was in like 98, I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: I moved to British Columbia in 96 from
Manitoba after doing that whole hemp thing
[SPEAKER_09]: out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Came out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only friend I really had was Hilary
Black.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hilary linked me up pretty early on
with Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so by 98, when I was trying these bags
and kind of sort of figuring out that I
[SPEAKER_09]: might end up doing my own bags,
what led me to that was the first time I
[SPEAKER_09]: ever ran Shishkeberry, because Steve had
called me up and he was like, look,
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really frosty trim.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try those bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually produced a full-melt hash
from a two-bag system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything from the 190 went into like
the 70 micron bag, just full of
[SPEAKER_09]: contaminant and was melting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, probably not anything like when
I finally met Sam some years later and
[SPEAKER_09]: smoked his dry sift and was like,
oh, oh, so there are actual levels to this
[SPEAKER_09]: shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: But still it was leading me in and it was
probably like a four-star.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first time I'd really ever seen
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But without that Shishkeberry and that
Shishkeberry, I mean, I could tell a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of stories because Steve was very close.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had access to both the red and the
yellow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I smoked that weed all over the world
and had that weed for hash making.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just every time when I first
smelt the barb from Great Gardener,
[SPEAKER_09]: immediately knew it was Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first smoked the Nicole from
Marimberos in Columbia, Alessandro,
[SPEAKER_09]: I immediately knew that he used
Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just this crazy dominant flavor
profile that is unmistakable yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen actual Shishkeberry in like
25 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'd be nice to see that come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to run those seeds from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Shishkeberry sounds,
if you can find a Shishkeberry leaner in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, it seems like even with your Wilson
attached to it, it seems like it may
[SPEAKER_04]: improve the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Shishkeberry came through me via a
hash jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Triple OG Icehouse melts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won Legends of Hash first place with a
Pink 57, which is a Shishkeberry Old
[SPEAKER_03]: Widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he came to my house like around the
time he had won second place with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came to my garden and he whips out this
jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, yo, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like in that papaya realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the time I was telling him
like, this is that fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, there's no light on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, that's Shishkeberry,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I need this, you know,
somehow some way a Shishkeberry plant
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up in my garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I made seeds with it
and just kept repopulating the forward
[SPEAKER_03]: line towards all the peach varieties that
I thought looked better than the initial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that's what I have as far as seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you hear anything Shishkeberry
from Macy's, the seeds made with that
[SPEAKER_03]: clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but that's how I got put on game with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yo, I need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple like years later,
like a year later, I ended up at
[SPEAKER_03]: Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just walking through and I,
and I looked to my right and great
[SPEAKER_03]: gardeners there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, yo, whoa, you're the,
you're the bar bud guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, let me grab a couple of
packs of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grabbed some rags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grabbed some fams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I throw them in the dirt almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything adds up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then the year after that,
I grabbed more just for the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just, just, just because cause they're so
nice, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but yeah, I'm like super down as far
as that, you know, story of where I got
[SPEAKER_03]: Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like this is who I got it from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the work I've done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as the clone, the legends of
hash winning variety and the Barbara bud,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all the same shade of gray,
you know, and then the candy Shishkeberry
[SPEAKER_03]: just won first place again with the mix of
a starburst.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I could only imagine how
good that was, but yeah, the Shishkeberry
[SPEAKER_03]: it's something old that I'm spotlighting
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, and that's why I always
give shout out Breeder Steve, shout out
[SPEAKER_03]: great gardener.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's what Shishkeberry should
let me ask Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on FaceTime with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, you know, one of the coolest
combos I've had with a person in the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: industry or the game or the culture,
whatever you want to call it in a while,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's just, it's humbling, you know,
I'm very, very thankful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a blessing to be around people
like that and have those tools.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's important work.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's, it is really important
work in the sense that it's only the
[SPEAKER_09]: people who have this obsession that care
enough to protect and create these
[SPEAKER_09]: different, you know, flavor profiles that
are going to end up, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when they end up in certain hands,
they end up becoming the foundation of
[SPEAKER_09]: this entire medical cannabis, you know,
like we don't want swag.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want like the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting how it translates
that like the dankest herb that you just
[SPEAKER_09]: can't put down that you just want to keep
smoking nonstop also happens to translate
[SPEAKER_09]: to the best medicine for people that
actually don't really have an interest in
[SPEAKER_09]: like the, maybe the flavor profiles and
all these other things, but it's,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's an interesting, invisible connection
that this obsession and this love of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis has this invisible tether to
producing, you know, these profiles that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, are great for getting high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I never, I never, you know,
that's, that's not a negative.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, Sam, I love getting high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would fight for people's rights to get
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just like a, another level to it
when it's about someone taking care of
[SPEAKER_09]: their health.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's there's, it's always been that way
for me, since I met Hillary Black and she
[SPEAKER_09]: was doing the BC compassion club.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is different, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have over here, we've got the hustle
and we're making and selling and flipping
[SPEAKER_09]: and flopping.
[SPEAKER_09]: But over here, this is like, we got to,
we got to have, there has to be a level of
[SPEAKER_09]: philanthropy involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: This can't be the same over here as it is
over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately in Canada right now,
it's a, they're pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we in the States too, man, it started
out, you know, two 15, we all,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you know, before even four,
two 15, it just, once the structure came,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just, it just all kind of, it seemed to
be a ploy to get to where we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I said before with the music
analogy, it's sort of where the,
[SPEAKER_04]: our industry is at, where no one truly
owns anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all VCs and a bunch of people that
are investing and those that are hanging
[SPEAKER_04]: on are so small that it's hard to compete
with that at that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it clouds the water,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like who's, who's right in that moment,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, and then the consumer isn't
really buying, buying with their,
[SPEAKER_04]: with their brain, they're buying with
their back pocket because they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: towards price and not who they're buying
it from.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that comes down to a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I actually applied to the DCC's actual
oversight board because everybody says,
[SPEAKER_19]: what's wrong with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_19]: And they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I go on a slight diatribe for a
second?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give everybody why we're fucked up here in
California.
[SPEAKER_19]: The DCC doesn't know cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't use cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So they don't understand that it's a
simple product, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have a jar here, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I put a small bud in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: That small bud goes in this jar.
[SPEAKER_19]: This jar is chock full of oxygen,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: What are the three things that kill
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oxygen, light and heat, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Majority of everything, of course is,
you know, in glass condition.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've talked about this before,
but if you used a simple gas ratio of 80%
[SPEAKER_19]: nitrogen, 20% Argon gas, and you pumped it
in, instead of leaving this full of
[SPEAKER_19]: oxygen, what's happened is a major shift.
[SPEAKER_19]: And let me walk you back through some
history people before 2018, I purchased
[SPEAKER_19]: from small farmers growing high terpene
rich small batch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would take that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would hold it for three weeks where I
would have it tested.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have it actually done with a plate
test.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when those were clean,
then we would package it into grams,
[SPEAKER_19]: eighths and ounces.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maximum I would buy would be usually
three to five kilos per batch tops max,
[SPEAKER_19]: usually one to two kilos per.
[SPEAKER_19]: That packaged and sold would go out the
door within two weeks maximum.
[SPEAKER_19]: Word of mouth, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, before we're all now just 7-Eleven
selling the same product.
[SPEAKER_19]: Prior, I had local regional farmers and
local products like Afgui, Constance that
[SPEAKER_19]: people would come to me for because it was
fresh, terpene rich, small batch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: The problem that we have now post 2018,
we've got large batch cannabis,
[SPEAKER_19]: mid grade, some high grade, being
absolutely massacred from its trimming.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's basically massacred from trimming on
down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see as I travel to large manufacturers,
they're putting all the same batch
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis in one huge bag, sometimes 10
kilos plus in a bag.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're throwing these bags around
like it's a fucking football.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you've got product being shaken up,
not being well taken care of in
[SPEAKER_19]: non-refrigerated environments because as
we know, anything above the room
[SPEAKER_19]: temperature of the grow room that was in
terpenes, diterpenes, everything is
[SPEAKER_19]: starting to evaporate if they're not
actually kept in a safe environment.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're not refrigerating it,
keeping it the same way as a beer or
[SPEAKER_19]: something has where it's from
manufacturing all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_19]: Two, we don't have quality product that's
going out quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's tonnage sitting on shelves in boxes
being eaten with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that oxygen in that bottle,
remember as we've talked about Hash
[SPEAKER_19]: Church, every three months it chemically
changes.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's actually more CBN and it's
degrading.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, sometimes I get my products that are
six months to a year old at my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you're getting stale product.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're getting fully oxygenated product in
glass jars and not refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and of course the issue of course then
is 11% humidity for packaging,
[SPEAKER_19]: right?
[SPEAKER_19]: To do it properly.
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of these things are somehow the
conundrum that the department of cannabis
[SPEAKER_19]: control cannot somehow understand,
but we all do because one, I'm a patient,
[SPEAKER_19]: two, I was a grower and I have an
understanding as how production,
[SPEAKER_19]: manufacturing and selling works.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're unfortunately, why people are
going to their local plug is because
[SPEAKER_19]: they're getting what they used to get
fresh terpene rich cannabis, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_19]: that stale product shit we're selling in
California.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why if people are wondering,
that's kind of a quick synapsis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the department of cannabis control
doesn't want to force the manufacturers or
[SPEAKER_19]: distributors to necessarily go through
these types of expenses.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if they did, we'd see the quality
change, everything go up.
[SPEAKER_19]: So other States that are listening,
we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_19]: You heard how we fucked up to do it
differently than how we did it so that
[SPEAKER_19]: you're better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, you nailed that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost like you're an expert on this
subject.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I add an anecdote to that?
[SPEAKER_17]: What I think is interesting is I'm not
going to name the grower or the product,
[SPEAKER_17]: but I ran into someone who recently won an
award at an event for some old flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's because he knows how to store his
flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: And literally it was past due,
past COA, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: But he entered it.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, dude, this is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's better than what I have.
[SPEAKER_17]: He threw it in there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he's like, talk about the next
competition.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, yeah, I'm going to throw it in
the next one too.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it'll be like a year and a half old at
that point.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he's just like, look, dude,
I know how to store flower properly.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can easily have shitty flower from
three months ago that looks worse than
[SPEAKER_17]: three years ago if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all the supply chain, the cold supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a cold supply chain,
there it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like we're all selling spinach in a
warm fucking container and sending it
[SPEAKER_09]: across the country and just like,
oh, it's sitting in the in the in the
[SPEAKER_09]: warehouse for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one hundred and five degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You open it up and it's just fucking like
liquid.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like we need a cold supply chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tell in Canada, it's fucking crazy
because when you when you go to the store
[SPEAKER_09]: in Canada and it's getting a little bit
better now, they have these little
[SPEAKER_09]: extraction fridges now that they never
used to have.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what you would generally see even like
up to a year ago and still today in most
[SPEAKER_09]: of the shops is you'll see a little
fridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go to the little fridge,
it is full of beverages that have 10
[SPEAKER_09]: milligrams of distillate in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only thing they're keeping cold are
10 milligram distillate shot, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: nano emulsified beverages.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what they're keeping cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the flour, all of the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is just off gassing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the you know, it's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets hot in the summer, man,
like 30, 40 degrees in Saskatchewan and
[SPEAKER_09]: Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like a hundred plus Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just cooking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, there would be a cost to keep
their vault cold in those in those months.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they only are allowed to display
packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like I mean, you can put
kind of buds out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But people realized quick that the way the
Canadian, you know, regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_09]: works is if you take flour out and you
have it on display, you have to destroy
[SPEAKER_09]: said flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't even give it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't like offer it for free or at a
discount.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Destroy said flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it becomes very expensive for these
shops to be opening up flour just so
[SPEAKER_09]: people can see it and not even basically
smell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's a complete and total nightmare
without the cold chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And without it, you you will never they
are so obsessed with stabilizing cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: that they don't realize that you cannot
really stabilize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: The best that you can do is you can make
it very cold and you can reduce the you
[SPEAKER_09]: know, that vibratory frequency that's
basically off gassing these volatile
[SPEAKER_09]: organic compounds without that,
without that slowing it down.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mojave is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had flour that I grew and dried well
before the fresh frozen days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw it in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can I suck the air out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw it in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really isn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it there for six years, Sam,
six years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I opened it up and people like,
dude, what are you doing with that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I this is new process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to, you know, make rosin out of
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this rosin that I made from this flour
and it was actual flour rosin was like a
[SPEAKER_09]: baby diaper.
[SPEAKER_09]: It stunk from like literally across the
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you really have to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's teasing us.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got Sam's trolling us.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, he's frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, he's talking secret is put it in the
inert gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it away from light and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, they do they do it with nuts
in little foil packs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in your coffee.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that was the thing is originally
the thought was the 80 percent nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_19]: 20 percent CO2.
[SPEAKER_19]: But when cannabis degrades, it turns to
CO2.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was why the suggestion of the
argon to, you know, stabilize the air
[SPEAKER_19]: around it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So no matter how it shifts, if it's kept,
you know, it would there be therefore be
[SPEAKER_19]: as self shelf stable as possible.
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing is the reason why they use
argon is because argon is heavier than
[SPEAKER_16]: air.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you got to remember air is 79 percent
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the difference between just regular
nitrogen, 100 percent nitrogen is the
[SPEAKER_16]: oxygen that's in there.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's going to take longer to sweep out
a container if you're just using nitrogen
[SPEAKER_16]: as opposed to argon.
[SPEAKER_16]: Argon is heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why that's why in Canada,
when we dry suit dive in the cold Pacific
[SPEAKER_09]: Ocean, we use argon gas to inject it into
our dry suits and it keeps us warmer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's another use for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Savvy Terps for talking about
noble gases about half an hour before we
[SPEAKER_09]: started talking about them in chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I use I've used it in in
ovens before, Mark, to to keep the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment in that oven, you know,
stable, completely in there in an open
[SPEAKER_04]: open container.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's I've done some really
interesting work doing that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if this is real, but like
about 10 years ago, someone I know,
[SPEAKER_17]: maybe less, maybe it was about eight years
ago, someone claimed to have bought the
[SPEAKER_17]: rights to the regional nitrogen packing
that everyone was going to have to buy
[SPEAKER_17]: into.
[SPEAKER_17]: If they did that in cannabis, and he
basically took me aside and he's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: you realize that everyone thinks this is
going to be the future, but this is a
[SPEAKER_17]: patented process.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the guy who holds that patent,
I just made a deal with for California and
[SPEAKER_17]: he thought he was going to make millions
because the whole industry was going to go
[SPEAKER_17]: towards the nitro packed cans.
[SPEAKER_17]: And anyway, I don't know if he was full of
shit or not, but it was it was interesting
[SPEAKER_17]: to see like, OK, this is, you know,
that's the kind of thought process you
[SPEAKER_17]: have to have in this business is be like,
way ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, they need to be.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're already doing it with potato
chips.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because when you fry potato chips and
unsaturated oils, they will degrade.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the potato chip companies, when they
package potato chips, you're blowing
[SPEAKER_16]: nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's our guy.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's already coffee.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing the coffee is they before
they do with all your coffee.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why it's open.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you feel that rush in is because they
are along the process of the machinery.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a puff station right before the
closed station.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it literally is the puff then seals in
its clothes and it goes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is keeping the oxygen out of your
coffee.
[SPEAKER_19]: So your coffee doesn't degrade.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you weren't aware.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't drink coffee, but that I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, GML just popped into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, are you in a desert or something,
dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't drink coffee either.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never drank coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife and I both don't drink coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: People would stay at our house and be
like, Hey, where's your coffee?
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'd be like, coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you can twist up a joint if you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'd just be like, you could see the
concern in their face, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like people really, there's something
about suppressing adenosone, like just
[SPEAKER_09]: like not having that feeling in your mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know it, but I certainly know
there are a lot of people out there that,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, beyond love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pushed on me when I was in like
grade three and that's, I just didn't like
[SPEAKER_08]: the taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I still don't to this day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got, you got hit up with the coffee
dealers in grade three.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sneaking out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember sneaking out of the house,
uh, with my cousin in grade three,
[SPEAKER_08]: going down to commercial drive and playing
street fighter too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the Italian coffee shop,
the hasty market and, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: just remember them offering me coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife cannot get up without coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's got the coffee maker in the bed
with her or?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you, but if you, uh, if you freeze,
uh, they make, they sell these online,
[SPEAKER_04]: freeze a, there's like a metal ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can freeze in the freezer or even do
it with a round ice ice cube.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you make espresso and have it pour over
top of the, the cold free frozen ice ice
[SPEAKER_04]: cube or frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Piece of metal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coffee will have, uh, a much,
a much different taste to it because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: retaining more of the, the, the chemical
compounds that are bringing that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that aromic property to life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you do with that Mojave?
[SPEAKER_17]: These are, these are, yeah, these are
actually just, well, they're not there for
[SPEAKER_17]: anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're, they're just steel, um,
frozen.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can freeze them and put them in
anything and drinks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're, they're kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if you ever need a bunch of,
ice cubes, but you don't want a bunch of
[SPEAKER_17]: water after they lose their coldness,
um, you get a bunch of these throw them
[SPEAKER_17]: into your cooler, throw them in whatever
they're fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not the best idea to replace your
ice in the hash making process with those.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing a lot of contamination.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And pretty, pretty aggressive as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, I've already an opinion on this,
especially from you, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, why don't people for those of us who
chew on ice, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't people use oxygen absorbers in
cannabis packaging?
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, um, if you have oxidation happening
and oxidation is usually how terpenes are
[SPEAKER_16]: going to degrade.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just a, um, it's a hydrogen
acceptor, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So when, when, um, if you look at,
um, uh, if you've ever heated,
[SPEAKER_16]: heated up THC distillate and you see white
smoke coming off, that white smoke is
[SPEAKER_16]: actually water, uh, that's being formed
from the degradation of THC, which is
[SPEAKER_16]: turning into CBN.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as THC certain turns into CBN,
it gives up two molecules of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so those two molecules of hydrogen
find the oxygen that's in the air and make
[SPEAKER_16]: water.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
H2O.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, so the white smoke that you see is
actually steam.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually water.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So oxygen is just, uh, well, it oxidizes,
but it gets reduced.
[SPEAKER_16]: So whenever something is oxidized,
something's reduced.
[SPEAKER_16]: So in that case, the molecular oxygen is
being reduced to water, but that means
[SPEAKER_16]: something was oxidized in order for that
hydrogen to be available.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the case of THC going to CBN,
you're oxidizing THC to CBN because it's
[SPEAKER_16]: losing those hydrogen and reducing
molecular oxygen from air.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you want to try to avoid air.
[SPEAKER_16]: So is that the question you want to try to
avoid oxygen?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, my question is like, you see like in,
in most food products, there's,
[SPEAKER_17]: there's two packets, one or two or both.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's usually silica or an oxygen
absorber.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the silica is for humidity and the
oxygen absorber specifically to combat
[SPEAKER_17]: oxidization.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in cannabis, like we adopted the whole
Boveda thing and the whole idea of like
[SPEAKER_17]: keeping a constant humidity in a packaged
product.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like other food products, they know
the big culprit for a lot of things is
[SPEAKER_17]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just wondering if there's a,
if there's a reason why oxygen absorbers
[SPEAKER_17]: haven't been adopted by cannabis,
or is it just that we haven't thought of
[SPEAKER_17]: it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is there an actual possible issue that
might arise?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we were, we were talking about how
the sour diesel bronzes out, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's kind of like a browning that,
you know, certain strains will actually
[SPEAKER_16]: undergo during curing, which is actually a
controlled oxidation, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: You're actually went during curing and,
and certainly like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, again, it seems as though some of
the more oxidized terpenes could actually
[SPEAKER_16]: be be forming in that curing process,
which is going to change the overall
[SPEAKER_16]: essence.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think in general, I mean,
just like in food, like if you think about
[SPEAKER_16]: like, just ground beef, for example,
when that oxidizes, right, it turns the
[SPEAKER_16]: beef brown, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So if they can grab a couple more days of
shelf life, and keep that ground beef red,
[SPEAKER_16]: that's a big savings for them,
you know, I mean, it's just, they can just
[SPEAKER_16]: give a few more days of shelf life,
because you're just absorbing the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's happening is that the thing
that's making, well, ground beef,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's one thought about that for a second,
is the blood and it's the heme that's in
[SPEAKER_16]: the blood, which is the complex with iron.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so when oxygen infiltrates that,
it changes the pigments color to brown.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why aged ground beef will look
more brownish than it does red.
[SPEAKER_16]: But um, but it would be like that for any
bloodborne products.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why I would imagine like,
in meat packaging, for example,
[SPEAKER_16]: you would have things that would absorb
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_16]: But like even in dairy products and other
things, where, well, cheese, for example,
[SPEAKER_16]: you'd probably want to keep cheese in an
air free environment, or else it's going
[SPEAKER_16]: to start or continue to degrade or cheese
is already degraded in a way.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I don't know if that if that's
what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, it's just kind of, it's just
kind of something I wonder about if
[SPEAKER_17]: there's a reason why certain products are
so trend towards oxygen versus humidity.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, guys, I got I got to bounce out
for a little bit, but I hope to see you in
[SPEAKER_17]: a little in maybe 45 or 50.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be back if you guys are still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mark, you know, that's I'll see soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question I wanted to jump into.
[SPEAKER_04]: The browning aspect, I have some diesel
that was harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It browns out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like good herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you smoke it, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it loses the emerald color.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, it just looks like just some
normal like I should go grab it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when you open the bag,
you're like hit with this overwhelming
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk gas, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really pungent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you look at it, you'd be like,
this looks like some mediocre herb,
[SPEAKER_04]: like to be real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but when you smoke it, it's super
flavorful and super delicious all the way
[SPEAKER_04]: down to the last hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you rolled a big joint of it,
you wouldn't eat you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could taste it literally all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many day cures something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's on that's a good that
batch, I think is a three week cure at
[SPEAKER_04]: this point.
[SPEAKER_16]: See, even that isn't that kind of pushing
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you need something more like about two
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going like it's it's where it's
at right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it's like it's that I think
it's almost at four weeks now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yeah, it'll it'll keep going,
you know, but it just it's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's it's such dank herb,
but it doesn't like in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: contemporary herb, you wouldn't consider
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would look at it and be like,
I'm not going to smoke it because it makes
[SPEAKER_09]: me want to see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me think that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we're talking about herb,
especially if we're growing it,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to share people's grows or any
hash making, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show show the flowers, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we want to see the flowers up close.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to chirp in with this.
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually keep this as my head stash jar
of a gas.
[SPEAKER_18]: My call it, which is GMO by gas mask.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I got this at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is this is a back seal jar that
has like an analog little hand action.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can hear it kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got a back release and you just twist
turn and it keeps the nuggies good for
[SPEAKER_18]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of go to the fridge with it even
for longer hold.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, and I've noticed the gas types
on me in the past, especially grown,
[SPEAKER_18]: sungrown, whether East Coast or West,
that they seem to oxidate really quickly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like you got like a two week window seems
to be a little bit more of a hold for the,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, color from like a delicate
indoor or whatnot holding it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the sound of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's jar should sound like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you when you show up to session and
you open a jar and it does that,
[SPEAKER_09]: people are like, what the fuck's that
motherfucker over there got?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I want to go check that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would think like deli style for med
shops.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maine's still medical here and the rec.
[SPEAKER_18]: So like these are if you're going deli
style, you know, and you're in and out of
[SPEAKER_18]: the jar, you just give it the twister.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not trying to sell the company or
anything.
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't tell who makes it, but like
devices like this to keep the air out for
[SPEAKER_18]: head stash, at least.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think it's OK to tell who makes it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if people want to look for it and
check it out, we're not getting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the brand is called.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's called fellow and it's just
that the local coffee shop, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: to keep your high end coffee beans good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is what this is what the cannabis
world has been doing since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of time, we just adopt cool things from
other industries.
[SPEAKER_09]: They pushed us out for so long.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like there's other things in the
world that may not be marketed as a
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, it works so well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll tell you, the first time I
made hash, it was with a twenty dollar
[SPEAKER_09]: cake mixer from Wal-Mart.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like just thought that hash was killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of why, you know, I obviously
I'm a part of Whistler Technologies.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's I'm a partner in that company and,
you know, all these other guys like low
[SPEAKER_09]: temp and hash tech and sambal filtration
and Delta separations.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all these different companies
doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's commercial.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Colin with his.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think you could still make great
cash on the cake mixer.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me say this easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diesel doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the bag appeal girl that everyone
believes it to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, man, in terms of the flavor and to be
real, man, it's a great breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good breeding stock because there's
just so much to to take from it and
[SPEAKER_04]: improve on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you show it again?
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Brian was pinned.
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are small because this is all that's
kind of dry right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just doesn't look like weed that
you'd be like, yeah, I'm going to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hold on to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you when you roll it up and you
put it to your lips, you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is all I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is this flavor profile?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, you know, like here's some
diesel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diesel's a fantastic varietal,
but you got to grow it really well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Colin, what's the story of the
diesel?
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that more like a mass super skunk
sided?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think KMD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: This diesel is gnarly good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and then here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some OG over here to some Trinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all really nice, but this is yeah,
I mean, all this stuff like needs to cure
[SPEAKER_04]: for like Mark said for a lot longer for
smoking grade material, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: The diesel is looking good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is sour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we should be having like the USB
microscope set up screen sharing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Pop that thing under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is better without hearing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: We missed that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you repeat it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about cannabis is better without
curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody think that cannabis is better
without curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my haze, I used to cure it for
three months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I feel very strongly about
haze in particular that letting those mono
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes like release whatever that
profile is and just letting that underside
[SPEAKER_09]: bouquet pop up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where you got that perfumey,
just incredible haze flavors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought that uncured weed was
better than cured weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I will say that it's kind of
what's happening with hash now,
[SPEAKER_09]: both in the BHO realm and in the water
hash realm.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about slapping it while it's
fresh frozen and making sure you run it
[SPEAKER_09]: really cold and make sure once you run it
that that goes into a freeze dryer and you
[SPEAKER_09]: keep your temperatures down as much as
possible in the sublimation process.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you sieve it right away to make sure
there's no ice particles in there,
[SPEAKER_09]: but get it right into a freezer to just
stop that off gassing of any kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember years ago, we were up at Hank's
apartment in the, oh gosh, I think it was
[SPEAKER_09]: in the Leipzig plane.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had an apartment above his,
what was it, the bulldog, his cattle.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a cafe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember that apartment,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've probably been there many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were up there and I was with Tony from
Sagamarta Seeds and I had made some dry
[SPEAKER_09]: sift with sweet skunk for the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I had cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had made it and it was old.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had it sitting for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had the plants sitting for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then he sifted them and that sat for a
while and it was just super well cured
[SPEAKER_09]: hash and then I cleaned it to 99.9% heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave Tony a rip of that and I'll never
forget him just leaning back on the couch
[SPEAKER_09]: and just exhaling it and being like,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I think if the younger
generation could smoke hash like this,
[SPEAKER_09]: they wouldn't go back to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was just so smooth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd let out a huge rip of this hash and
it was sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was also already a very gentle,
soft and just welcoming profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the haze lineage, but certainly not as
rank or dank, but still just so fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet on the flip side, I love a good rip of
some fresh frozen that has been preserved
[SPEAKER_09]: all the way and that makes me cough and
makes my eyes almost pop out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just love what you love.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different levels to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think back to the genetics thing,
I wanted to kind of touch on some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: lines that Masonic that you might be
working on that you're stoked on now since
[SPEAKER_04]: you've worked Wilson through the lines
that you have worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you seeing right now that you're
like, yo, this is really unique?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was doing a single male donor
pollinations for a while with Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to the point where that's what I
was identified as.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, you only do Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you only make hash strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, like I cross Wilson to
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make everything, you know,
I don't necessarily only grow one type of
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm very open minded about looking
under every rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing that, you know,
I'm always doing is looking for trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: see what everything is, putting the smell
to every name out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you guys are saying sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are saying all these varieties,
like super mass, the G's all looking in my
[SPEAKER_03]: drawer while you're saying diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I have like a, a rose flow diesel
variety that I visited five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds I made five years ago where mine
knows isn't in like as, as it was five
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago where now I could like kind of
spot things and label it quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas five years ago, I'm still learning
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, oh crap, let me dig through
this diesel rose flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if I find anything significant,
but all that to say is like what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I did the single male donor Wilson
pollinations for like 16, 17, 18,
[SPEAKER_03]: 19, 20, 21 is finally when I stopped doing
single male donor pollination with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it on the back burner and then that
year something possessed me to just let
[SPEAKER_03]: everything just pollinate each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every single seed stock that I had in
that seed from that season, from all these
[SPEAKER_03]: dope breeders, honey banana hybrids,
Skittle hybrids, Bode year, the list goes
[SPEAKER_03]: on and on, you know, land race variety
straight from Thailand, straight from
[SPEAKER_03]: India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just let it all rock, you know,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it natural selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I did for 21, 22,
and then last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the past three years, I've been
doing these open pollinations with
[SPEAKER_03]: different males from different seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally random.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's literally what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I made seeds for three years and I
was happy with all that progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would pop it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, dope, like mom's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if it was like a mom,
that wasn't something that I liked
[SPEAKER_03]: subjectively the offspring from it from
that natural selection would be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, like that's likable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it was like, cool,
we're on to something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people weren't with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that were with it, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kept me through that three years,
the past three years, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 22, 23, two years, but kind of like 21 is
a 22, 23 for like two years that I've had
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, 24 comes along.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, cool, let's do something else
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of just went with the algorithm
of what everyone's kind of like looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Starburst, I was like, fuck it,
let's rock this Starburst.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone likes Starburst right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Starburst right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something you can easily go grab.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to give me the Starburst
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like asking for stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never ended up on my desk,
but higher grounds sold Starburst F1 seed
[SPEAKER_03]: stock and F2 seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I dedicated some indoor runtime to some
Starburst varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hunted one pack of F1s and two packs
of F2s, kept all the males, kept all the
[SPEAKER_03]: females, made my selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm making, now I made, and I'm making
more F3s within.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now I'm on a Starburst Warpath as
well as everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nothing is left unlooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if a new breeder comes out with a
pack, I'm the first in line to grab it
[SPEAKER_03]: just because it's like my job to always
have my like, you know, just be privy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way when I'm talking, I know what the
hell I'm talking about, or I could have
[SPEAKER_03]: something to say on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm not like, oh,
I won't grow that dude's gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, nah, if someone's making some noise
and, you know, let me, let me see what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking at, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm always, I'm always wondering
what's what.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dude, can you, can you, can you walk us
through the garden right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a little, a little
walkthrough?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is, so this is one of my two
gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it brings me back to being like
when I was like 23.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of two gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: This I call the discovery garden,
cause I don't do production here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do light depths here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I literally just pop seeds and
let everything rock here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the, this is the discovery
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for starters, massive plant,
as soon as I step outside, seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere, all brand new seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all brand new seed starts,
all new smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a watermelon patch that I just
untilled and threw back in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, those are some huge plants right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a jungle out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you go through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, imagine this fucking guy is your
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just like, what's this guy all
about?
[SPEAKER_09]: You find his fucking Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just love it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I even like throw down trays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like just grow some weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to literally go through
this tunnel to get through the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's more weed over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's more weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, those are the power lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, they're growing in a kiddie pool
and there's more weed down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more like these I've been throwing
plants in there just 10 times over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throw a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a, you know, just kind of using
what I got, you know, I don't have a farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: so this plant, I didn't support it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of just toppled over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of just letting it rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get some hash off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get like three ounces, four ounces
of hash off of that bad boy just chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is my discovery garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as big as the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is inspirational.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is relatable.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, you know, it's, you don't like,
grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, you know, grow some weed,
find some flavors.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need a multimillion dollar
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you planting, are you pollinating with
mulch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you hitting multiple males on the same
female?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, am I multiplying with multiple
males from the same seed stock?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when I'm doing my natural
selection, open pollinations to make that
[SPEAKER_03]: seed stock, it is different males from
that same seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what you asked.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you say males or males, Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you asking if he was hitting multiple
different males pollen to one female?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't hit males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured, you know, you do,
it's the other way around, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the reason I'm asking that is because.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does this mic keep doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm asking if he's using multiple
different varieties of males on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more than likely that is what's going
to happen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless like, I can't tell, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's five different males with one
female growing with it, I guess it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: a cat, you know, cats can have different
dads when they have their babies,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm guessing it's more so that then,
oh, you know, just one of them hit it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because there's, there's
different males.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no telling, you know, you could
pop the progeny and wonder what might've
[SPEAKER_03]: hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all in all, I just take it for like
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be anything, you know,
if there's five males, any of those males
[SPEAKER_03]: could have hit it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just to get it like as diverse
as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just making seeds and, and, and you can
label it, whatever you want after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make it diverse as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just so happens that it's chaos
breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's one of like one year,
two years of like the next 80 years of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding that I have that I just kind of
visited and it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won first place legends for Christ's
sake.
[SPEAKER_03]: The candy shishka berry was a natural
selections lineage, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's not that that's like to
prove well, it's pretty good proof that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's good, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: With Skittles, nobody could tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could tell you all their lore.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, you know, a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of like the credo behind
that is like, Oh, we're just making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, as far as receiving end is concerned,
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got half the story locked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the donor is concerned,
I'll just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I grow these seeds from what I know,
like, Oh, if I see something that has haze
[SPEAKER_03]: in it, tie, I could smell it almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shishka berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's shishka berry candy,
shishka berry males out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it hit it almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a little selfish, but I'm
making seeds very transparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me, yo mace, what were the
males out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could explain a bunch of times,
but it's all like, dude, it's random.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I tell you, you're not going to be
able to know because you're going to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: down the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do know it's cause you're a
discerner, you'd probably tell me before I
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you, you know, I smell Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably Tom Hill Hayes F3 hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a white Tahoe skunk that
probably hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, but all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's my thing was like that this,
this year, this natural selections,
[SPEAKER_03]: the reason I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I'm asking is because I
often use a male, a single male,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hit it towards hundreds of different
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know what the male is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did the previous five years
with my Wilson male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I decided to do, as I'm doing the
natural selections pollination,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing other single male donor
pollinations at different spots,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to like do my vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fills up to me in a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a whole lot of everything,
you know, Oh, look, just cross these
[SPEAKER_03]: together and cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is my way of like, kind of in
essence, doing all that at once per se,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just what would I have?
[SPEAKER_03]: All at once and still work single male
donor pollinations on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing other pollinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a freak show pollination right
now as we speak, as I'm doing a starburst
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination, as I'm doing this chaotic
breeding is some might be, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all being done at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not just one thing that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it all, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the bottom line is, like you said,
cultivar is winning legends.
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk about if it's, if there's,
if it's making noise, you've been making a
[SPEAKER_09]: ton of noise for some years now.
[SPEAKER_09]: People love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: People love the Wilson.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been able to fall into it with the
right, you know, meeting Bloom early on
[SPEAKER_09]: and getting, you know, those papayas.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's a great way to do it in
the sense of just using your nose and
[SPEAKER_09]: following, you know, Toucan Sam style.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, it's very, you know, that
chicken's bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: That chicken's bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make a big chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's, and then the scientists
and the people that are good with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: jargon, they could back me up and be like,
oh, this is why he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that is why I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll respew that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy peasy, you know, but that's,
that's kind of the game for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm, I'm the guy in the garden,
just planting thousands of plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: taking care of them myself with the little
space that I've had, but with the passion
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, is like, you know,
trumps everything that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to smoke, you know, I hate to be
like weird, weird about it, but like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to smoke hash all day and just have
hash around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like, as long as that's
sustained, the quality of my life is
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's what I revolved my
life around to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, I just have to be as good as I
can with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of nodding heads, a lot of nodding
heads while you said that at least three,
[SPEAKER_09]: at least three that I saw.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome to Selena.
[SPEAKER_09]: Selena snuck in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like you're sitting in a nice
little garden or at least a photo of a
[SPEAKER_09]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the most beautiful garden right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my friend Drake garden,
you know, Drake.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a really interesting growing
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Fijadam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys are familiar with it,
but I'm going to show you guys really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick where I'm sitting, just to give you
a quick glance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like literally amongst this beautiful
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look up, like these canopies,
I want to say it's about 12 feet tall now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are so vigorous and healthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that in Vernon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a beach and grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to show it to you guys
today because I really think it goes along
[SPEAKER_00]: well with what you've been talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversation has been wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already tell after today that we're
going to have some of Mesa's seeds growing
[SPEAKER_09]: in our gardens in the near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about all those flavors got me
fucking drooling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can contest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've drawn a lot of your work,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything you've sent and everything
we've bought has produced something worth
[SPEAKER_04]: running in terms of the hash realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's rare to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thug Pug is another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of his work seems to just do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's another one that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously Fletcher Archive, he's got a
good knack for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, man, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you gave me the natural selections I
ran, like RS-11.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you gave me a GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave me a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back on the list,
but there's a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the RS-11 vividly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That came out very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, even like the Willie Nelson,
not Wilson's that you gave us were like
[SPEAKER_04]: oddly good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long ago did you get those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a couple of years ago,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are older ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I made those strains, I'm just
popping stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what Willie Nelson is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 32 from South Central.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't grow up on Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew up on OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though everyone's like at the time,
2018, no one was getting props for growing
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes unless you were in the in crowd with
the mean jeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as status quo hash heads,
they disregard almost everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even nowadays, everyone agrees on a
certain turban profile as far as the mass
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, I'm just kind of doing
left field stuff, doing stuff that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's all I had at the time,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, let's rock this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's rock this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had gifted me those packs and he
was held to a high regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me throw these in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just kind of happened like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never like, yo, we're on a chase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to grab that one because we're
going to be rolling in dough when we do
[SPEAKER_03]: that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's always been like everything
natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Willie Nelson, NL5, ended up becoming
like one of the strains I threw on the
[SPEAKER_03]: back burner because at the time,
it smelled nothing like candy,
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing gas, nothing sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like evergreen, floral,
hazy type type turk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw it on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have I had like a one
gallon bag full of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would just give them a way for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times we'll sell them for 10
bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up becoming one of the
varieties that a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_03]: because it ended up being a better grower
than most of the varieties because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: lineage that it had in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just learned along the way that like
everybody likes everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might like what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ended up becoming like a record store
when it came to my seed varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, I like skittles and candy
and gas and sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I'm going to buy when I'm
making my purchases.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would be a disservice and it would
suck for anything else not to exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, train wreck just one day doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have all those offerings as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make sure to lock in and make hybrids,
whether it be with a single male donor,
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination or natural selections,
as far as receivers are concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like it's like a record
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, I literally tell people,
what do you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I like candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you love these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's and you know,
everything's great for what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone likes what they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Shishkeberry happens to be a
safe one for a lot of people like at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually surprised to see it come
back around, to be honest, with all the
[SPEAKER_04]: things in the world that have come,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, knowing what I know of it,
maybe it's been here all along.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, if nobody would have ever spotted
papaya, I think like the way Harry did,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would have just.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see brains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else would have did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He like so the way it happened with him is
some dude smoking him out with papayas and
[SPEAKER_03]: chatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yo, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dude's like, here's the clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's like making fems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's it's kind of like and that's
when it gets in more people's hands,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's harder to get the actual
clone into people's hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the seed stock, it's like you
could send it to Iran from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, good luck sending the fucking
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've seen crazy things with us
once too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we've been running S1 sours that
we've made just like ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're seeing like ridiculous plants
that are very impressive that I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: believe could exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just you got to hunt large
populations of it to Sam's point.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having some technical difficulties
right now, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like the stream stopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to get it going again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the custom live stream is going
and we're still recording, but I don't see
[SPEAKER_09]: it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see the stream.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't find the chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't find everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just don't want to admit to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it shows that it's it's ended for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can't find the chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can easily just start this over real
quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just you know what I'm going to
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to do the way I usually do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to stop the live stream and then
I'm going to live stream on to YouTube,
[SPEAKER_09]: which will create a whole new YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can just continue the
conversation from here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I have to splice them together,
that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a big deal either.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't want to miss the conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for your guys' patience.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you in Grand Square there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just checking shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mays, this is Blueberry Banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We watched this in April.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew this right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got excited when we're talking about our
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew this and I washed it in my backyard
in Compton.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I noticed you're doing some air dry
stuff, which I love to see because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly it's where I think all of us,
at least on this panel here, started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is our air dry fatso that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have air dry heads in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was freeze dry because,
don't get me wrong, I love my air dry
[SPEAKER_03]: technique, but I do air dry because of
lack of freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just kind of working our way up the
ladder.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are good at air drying as far as we
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned from Pua.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Pua works for Nelson and Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were showing off a jar
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's who taught me how to air
dry was Pua.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a really dope hash maker.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he is a dope hash maker.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met him in Barcelona years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a good kid, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say, if you can master air
drying, everything else is easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you understand the inherent needs
of that material on a level that you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: learn the other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't learn it any other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if someone gave me the freeze dryer,
I'd be like, let's learn how to air dry
[SPEAKER_03]: first, because that's just I'm like work
from the bottom on the way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like reverse engineering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just kind of know every piece of
the engine to an extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it makes you think about where Sam's
mind was all those years ago when he was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, well, I'm just going to cure my
herbs so good that when I go to sift it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like the best of all the worlds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's with a capital V.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with a grow all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I found.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like just grow the best flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have the best hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's usually environmental in a lot
of cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can have the genetics
subjectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could care less for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the clean resin at the end,
that's from my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been like, oh, man, I could have
prevented more dust from kicking up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would have been the literal 50
percent better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it would have just been that much
better, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts with the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, a lot of stuff's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get your one percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just not going to get what you want
back on some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I washed 500 grams of black lime reserve
and we got like a gram back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with all the information we have out
there and everybody talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's where clones, I think,
or lines that are known, such as your male
[SPEAKER_04]: lines that you created that turned into
the lines that you work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like skunk one, Sam, I'm sure you
selected and leaned into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For reasons that were most likely towards
the end of things you wanted to make and
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The BLR Wilson does dump as opposed to the
BLR mom itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your answer right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everything washes is just BLR Wilson
dumps about four or five as opposed to BLR
[SPEAKER_03]: by itself, where it only does one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And BLR Wilson does still carry on that
lime tinge, not as explosive as mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's more of a sharp burn your eyes
lime.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Wilson gives it like a cream back
end, but it's like a lime cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, like, you know,
you've got to kind of work it,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of kind of work it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only Hayes thing that I've seen told me
the black lime to watch out for herms if I
[SPEAKER_04]: ran seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you saw?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no herms, no herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see herms in in in land race varieties
more than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see herms in my greenhouse when I'm
growing it in the summer with the with the
[SPEAKER_03]: doors closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really see herms when like I live
in Compton, California and never gets
[SPEAKER_03]: below 40 here and never gives it gets
above like 105.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like it's always within
that frame and it's like very forgiving
[SPEAKER_03]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I grow, I've only noticed herms
when I'm growing plants in places where
[SPEAKER_03]: they shouldn't be growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the shade where they're like
getting confused with the sun in the shade
[SPEAKER_03]: or in a in a greenhouse where the
temperature is fluctuating a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: more than they're used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I notice herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also notice herms in a lot of like
feral land race varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've grown some stuff that was sent
to me from Saipan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown some stuff from that was sent
to me from India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown some stuff from Thailand that
was sent directly from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to be a little bit more careful
growing those as opposed to just anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the BLRs, no, I literally paid top
dollar for those seeds in a charity
[SPEAKER_03]: auction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I allocated some F1 seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also bought the cut that Skunk Tech
and Mean Gene were selling collectively
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were doing on an Instagram sale
about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have both of my selections and
theirs in my living library as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: seed stock, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk Tech has some really good stuff that
he had sent to the states that I received
[SPEAKER_04]: and then eventually sent to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they're from Chimera,
a bunch of old stock that he just popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some posts of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there should be, I think he should be
probably releasing some of those too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chimera stuff was always really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sam, didn't you work with Chimera?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam mentored Chimera.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's known, yeah, he's known Ryan for a
very long time, 25 plus years,
[SPEAKER_10]: I would guess, at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome to Wade Laughter who popped
in as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a little bit of tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we didn't breathe that much
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we actually did was we worked
together primarily supplying seeds to the
[SPEAKER_01]: nether.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Canada, we sold to all the big
dispensaries, licensed dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: They definitely had that figured out
before most.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a window there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those guys sold a schwack of seeds into
Canada for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I can hear it in the background there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear Sam talking, echoing on the
YouTube that restarted.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how are you doing today, Wade?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not muted, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not so great.
[SPEAKER_13]: The chemotherapy has been harder to hold
than I had hoped it would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I decided to drag myself out of bed
and see what was happening in Hash Church
[SPEAKER_13]: because this is one of my deepest loves to
concentrate with this plant and what she
[SPEAKER_13]: can do for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's all I have to report.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am ingesting significant quantities of
TBD and TBN based on some science I saw a
[SPEAKER_13]: couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hoping to see some results from that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, mostly doing okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're glad to have you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: In any way, shape or form, we're just glad
to have you here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's real sweet to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also broken my clavicle here in the
last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm dealing with a broken bone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly not anything compared,
but boy, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I broke the clavicle on this side,
opening a pill bottle a couple of days
ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my, that's what that was that broke?
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I flew off a skateboard going mock
speed and landed on my shoulder at the
[SPEAKER_09]: Whistler skate park.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was kind of like getting hit with a
bat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was no bueno.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still trying to figure out this
technical difficulty we had.
[SPEAKER_09]: We lost about 175 live viewers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had 368 people watching live and we're
back to about 153.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys for being the hard cores
that came back and hopefully the rest of
[SPEAKER_09]: people will realize that we're back on
tune.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in 10 years of doing Hash
Church, it hasn't just shut off on YouTube
[SPEAKER_09]: many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's maybe like the second or third
time that's ever happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: So apologies for the technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did do it differently today and I'll
probably just stick to doing it the same
[SPEAKER_09]: from now on because that was stressing me
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like a pro after 10 years because I
was having a massive anxiety attack
[SPEAKER_09]: wondering where the stream went,
but I didn't want to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys for your patience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's time to smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried any suppositories for your
pain?
[SPEAKER_09]: Me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've been just eating gummies.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, you know, just been chomping on the
white rabbit gummies, the sugar-free brown
[SPEAKER_09]: rice syrup sweetened vegan little gummies.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just 10 milligrams of pop,
but I, you know, eat like maybe five of
[SPEAKER_09]: them throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had to take like Tylenols or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I think it was Thomas talking
about suppositories last week in regards
[SPEAKER_09]: to how much it helped his relative there
with the stage four liver cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct, Thomas?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was doing actually six weeks of a
hyperbaric chamber just like basically
[SPEAKER_08]: compressed oxygen, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, or I don't know, like going under
oxygen under pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, he's been just taking like a
suppository dose every single day because
[SPEAKER_08]: he has no tolerance at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he had all different types of tumors
all over his liver.
[SPEAKER_08]: And literally about six of them are gone
and he's down to two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the last three months, they haven't
grown at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've all been just like, like even the
doctors are just like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: just keep on doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's kind of taking like a high dose of
vitamin C and then just, yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: suppository dose every single or twice a
day now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just trying to load them up as much
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the doses he's on for
suppositories?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just was making rosin and making it as
like putting just a little bit of coconut
[SPEAKER_08]: oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't even know if he actually even
needed any coconut oil, but like I had
[SPEAKER_08]: just been making pure rosin and just maybe
about a 10% ratio of coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then putting it in gel caps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's been taking a couple of those a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had to guess, it's probably like at
least 600 milligrams I would imagine or
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 from each one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had it actually lab tested it,
but I'm using like a good, like it was
[SPEAKER_08]: made from flour too for the most part,
but it's decent flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know one thing, if I wanted edibles,
I would never get Thomas to make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He would make them for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy eats 2000 milligrams at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't eat 2000 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cultivar are you using for the rosin
for these suppositories?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious from a patient perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually, it's been a combination
of three.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like this death baba strain that
I've had for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was mac daddy and a pink Kush
was just what I happened to have been
[SPEAKER_08]: growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've just been from that one crop and I
just made like a bunch of oil from them,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we've get it running really,
really low.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, you know, I was thinking about like,
do I even need to mix coconut oil into it?
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone's taking it suppository,
I'm not even sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've about to make a whole bunch more
for him though.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like really, well, he was given like
months to live basically at some point,
[SPEAKER_08]: like a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's like, it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, how's this constitution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he getting his energy back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I just saw him two days ago and
he like looked so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was surprised on how well he looked
compared to like six months ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: like where he was always sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, um, usually people, when they have
it, they get really, really tired.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, he's just doing really like,
he obviously still is a little bit tired
[SPEAKER_08]: and he, you know, he, he's completely cut
out any type of sugar in his diet too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, just trying to eat as healthy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for doing that for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's exciting to see, like I said,
uh, I, you know, I was, when he was doing
[SPEAKER_08]: the hyperbaric chamber, like it wasn't
taking it out, like the same way that the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis has been anyways, but I think
that's anybody's best bet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I, we lost somebody else in my family
from it and I got them a bunch of ROs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our RSO, and they were afraid to take
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, cause you know,
they're afraid of getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just like, no one has an excuse
not to take it suppository.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not use as many weapons as you
possibly can, if you get into this type of
[SPEAKER_08]: situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I recommend to everybody and
just push it on your family member.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just make them try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's like, and obviously they
play well together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, is it vitamin C, like IV therapy
that they're doing as well?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I'm not sure about that part,
but I would imagine it's like a high grade
[SPEAKER_08]: or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine it's like.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good type of UV or what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say UVC vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been talking about UVC lately so
much just having that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thomas has UVC on the, uh, on the brain,
Selena.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the predator lights that he's
released that, uh, disrupt bug populations
[SPEAKER_09]: in a sort of, uh, pretty miraculous way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you like, I mean, just for myself,
can you explain a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: how that works?
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get high from a suppository.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, if you put it up too high,
like usually when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: patient care, I also work with medical
patients that use cannabis, like to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher you go, the higher you'll get
is usually what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a part of your colon that
correlates with the liver and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: quite high if you insert it too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, your hydration level,
you know, your diet, all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really it makes a difference in how
that suppository is going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: be received or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: To be quite honest, I've never got into
that part of the topic of how,
[SPEAKER_08]: like how far, how far to push it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I never even thought of that,
but I didn't, definitely didn't think that
[SPEAKER_08]: it gets you high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like this guy or my cousin,
like he took 20 milligrams orally,
[SPEAKER_08]: he'd be totally leveled.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess he's, it's keeping it at a
level where he's not getting high yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and what I've also seen with some
patients that I've worked with is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the degree of cancer that
they're fighting and the degree of pain
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the medicine goes towards
mitigating that first before it presents
[SPEAKER_00]: as a euphoria or dysphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we've had an example where
somebody's cancer went into remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taking the same dose that they'd
always taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden they were very intoxicated
from the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is it was because the
cancer had gone into remission and it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't needed for fighting the cancer
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I mean, this plant is miraculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really, we don't fully know,
but I think it's really cool that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, we're at least experimenting
and people have access to it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing that option for your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just this topic got brought up
earlier this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, while there was like, uh, someone had
said something about the legal market and
[SPEAKER_08]: the, and you know, the black market or the
legacy market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And before I made a post, I actually went
around and I like phoned a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: different stores to just see like how much
someone can get a gram of RSO if they need
[SPEAKER_08]: to fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, you know, at the cheapest I
could get was like $34 for something
[SPEAKER_08]: that's 650 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, what percentage of the
population can actually afford to take
[SPEAKER_08]: that or do that twice a day?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's just, it's not, it's not
affordable for people, but on the,
[SPEAKER_08]: like on the legacy side of things,
you definitely can find stuff that's
[SPEAKER_08]: affordable for people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a real issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, um, where, well, like the government
or some people need to start stepping up
[SPEAKER_08]: or advocating to subsidize anybody,
if they, if they legitimately have cancer,
[SPEAKER_08]: they should, they should, it should be a
right where they can get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I know people that are, you know,
telling me that they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're trying to take it as much as they
can, as they can afford it, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty crazy when you're fighting for your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to pay excise tax on top of it
all is just such an insult, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know when they subsidize to the
most stupidest other things you would
[SPEAKER_08]: imagine, like when you look at other
things or other departments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's where too, you know,
like I'm, I'm in a patient grow right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if patients have the option to grow
their own medicine, obviously it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the most cost-effective way to
get it, but not everybody has the space or
[SPEAKER_00]: has the capability, especially if they're
in a certain, you know, weakened state of
[SPEAKER_00]: health, um, you know, and time,
time is a really big factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I think like the power of
community is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to have, you know, those
neighbor grows that can share medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: share resources or having friends that
have, you know, those freezers full of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra product that they're not necessarily
going to use and being able to share that
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the community for people that
really need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd love to see more of those types of
channels happen on a, on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great way to take back our
power as, as humans, as sovereign beings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well said for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still trying to figure out how the
show got cut off, but we're back to 200
[SPEAKER_10]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're we got back up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bumping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are, people are coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finding you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still having your panic attack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I'm pretty relaxed other than,
you know, the soreness, but I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's nothing like soreness or a pain to
really force you to be in the moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of people spend a lot of
time in the past where they spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: time in the future, which of course causes
anxiety and or depression.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's good to just try to be present.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's one of the reasons why I love
cannabis so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause cannabis is also a nice little like,
Hey, look how beautiful the world is when
[SPEAKER_09]: you pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you actually just exist in it in that
moment, rather than be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do this, this, this,
and this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got all these plans for the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, that's anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you go back to the past and you're
like, Oh, I did this, this, this,
[SPEAKER_09]: and this, and now it's different.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's depression.
[SPEAKER_09]: Best to just stay in the moment if you
can.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I I'm not the best at it, but uh,
look at this gift you've given yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: this broken clavicle to just bring you
right back into here and now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a, and slow me down too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a very type a personality.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I move very quickly, very quickly
everywhere, always doing things fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is like a good, a good reminder
that slows good too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can keep up with you in the airport now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I walk so fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like really bad knees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a, well, not always,
but I have arthritis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes it's like such a fight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, dude, please just slow it down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: My knee.
[SPEAKER_09]: He has asked me to slow down a little bit
in the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a walking meditation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That like slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually get so much more done when
you just slow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that presence that you were
talking about being in the care now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I walk like, uh, I'm about to have a heart
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used to, I called it hummingbird
mode, which I mean is appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, but also you need to stop and
like, smell the flowers and enjoy life
[SPEAKER_00]: while it's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it would take me forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I, we were going at my speed,
like Marcus will get right in there and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll like get him in the elevator.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or else I'd be like, I'm letting everybody
go where everybody's just fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, he's just like, oh yeah,
he's not messing around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, I have to keep up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, he'll cut in front of one
person.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to get with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like one of those like little
kid, like harnesses on him where he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: like the little vest with the little
leash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's, uh, I'm sure if those
existed when I was younger, I probably
[SPEAKER_09]: would have had one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I'm sure I gave my parents heart
attacks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids are amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you don't think so, but they,
they are so aware of when you're staring
[SPEAKER_09]: at them, when you're looking at them,
when you're perceiving them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the second you stop perceiving them
and they bolt, it's like, it's why you're
[SPEAKER_09]: like, how could that kid possibly have
gotten away in that short a period of
[SPEAKER_09]: time?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, well, I'll just, just have a
couple and you'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vigilantly watching for you to just look
away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you think is two seconds was
actually like two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now your kids like seven aisles over
hiding in the cereal boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun while you freak the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got cat kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a mouse this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came into my room and presented me with
a mouse at 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a different kind of fun
surprise.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I get that every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yesterday was a bird.
[SPEAKER_09]: The day before was a shrew.
[SPEAKER_09]: The day before that was a mouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just been consistent for like,
say maybe the last 200 plus days.
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat is a murderer.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, when my cat gets consumed by like
coyotes or whatever's going to eat it,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say what I said last time when people
go, Oh, aren't you sad?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll say live by the gun, die by the
gun.
[SPEAKER_09]: That murderous motherfucker killed
thousands.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now he too has been murdered.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, woe is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's like the cycle of life,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably died doing what he loved,
murdering something else or changing
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And probably when he finally won my
original cat, Dutch, who got killed many,
[SPEAKER_09]: many years ago by coyotes and then flown
out of my village by a bald eagle.
[SPEAKER_09]: When Dutch passed away, he I'm sure he
realized he was like, Oh, this is what
[SPEAKER_09]: it's like.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be on the Dutch love to like pull baby
birds out of nests.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was a serial.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a serial killer.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the most sadistic cat ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would be remiss.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be remiss if I didn't show a
picture of Dutch as I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch, because he was my favorite cat and
he was murderous and he was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he got eaten by coyotes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch would go on hikes with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd cruise around with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Up in the forest, climb trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like 25 pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a huge cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like paws were like, people were
like, Oh, why do you have a cat that's so
[SPEAKER_09]: big?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saved him from a homeless like shelter
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this kind of crazy cat lady had him
and she couldn't take care of him or
[SPEAKER_09]: herself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, Oh, you know, I paid her
for whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was 25 bucks to get that cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a street cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was the best cat that ever lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: He usually are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we love our pets.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you owning cats and dogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a big division in the cats and
dogs community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Owning cats and dogs is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you get to really know the unique
nuances of like the just like completely
[SPEAKER_09]: unconditional love of a dog and the
complete like absolute dismissal of a cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're so neat to have on both sides.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love animals.
[SPEAKER_09]: So always have.
[SPEAKER_09]: RIP to my little dog that passed away a
couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and Brian's dog as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, you know, when I saw the
painting, I was like, that dog has passed
[SPEAKER_09]: on for sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was my Stella girl,
Stella Blue.
[SPEAKER_18]: She died a year and a half ago,
but she was 16 and she traveled,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, it's from Southern Humboldt and
grower lines on both ends of the family.
[SPEAKER_18]: So she had a good long life.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I just lost my little baby Lucy
at seven years old, beautiful cane Corso
[SPEAKER_18]: about three months ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's been a change here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just kind of been like moving
through it and going through the grieving
[SPEAKER_18]: and understanding unconditional love for
sure rings a bell.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've got a big lesson and a
blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a painting of her next to you?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just got this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_18]: The painting here is of my old girl,
the big one.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then this is just a picture of Lucy in
the greenhouse right next to the raised
[SPEAKER_18]: beds in the light app.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I was happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a cane Corso named Lucy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had another cane Corso named Leah,
actually, that I lost her about two years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago and she was one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got her spayed and it was from the
surgery.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so crazy because like I had a bad
feeling about the place we were going to,
[SPEAKER_08]: like someone had said something bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then I went and found another vet who
had the best reputation around.
[SPEAKER_08]: They tested her and did all these tests
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yeah, she when I got her home,
she bled out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had another one, believe it or not,
before that, that it was another cane
[SPEAKER_08]: Corso and it had like a bunch of defects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I spent like about seven grand trying
to figure out what was wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had something in a spinal cord and
we had to put them down at like six months
[SPEAKER_08]: old.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a cane Corso guy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they're beautiful animals.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to know they're very patient and
taught me like she was really low pressure
[SPEAKER_18]: dog.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's kind of carried on in spirit,
you know, where it's like a low pressure
[SPEAKER_18]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it really is kind of come in with like
a lot of peace into my life.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've got to get a good blessing from
that baby.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love the canes too.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that's probably one of
her gifts to you, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: afterlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it just carries through.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, right away.
[SPEAKER_18]: Very vivid.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is like more, you know, obviously
noticeable now that she's gone,
[SPEAKER_18]: but it was like immediate, immediate
transferal there, you know, of energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, RIP to our friends that have come
and gone, both animal and human for that
[SPEAKER_09]: matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say to people when I hear them
grieving, I think of Dr. Seuss who said,
[SPEAKER_09]: don't be sad that they're gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be happy that they were here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, yeah, dude, no shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I saw, I saw my friend Clint
Young had posted recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: He lost his father not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he wrote, I miss you, dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that you're gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I wrote in the comment section,
or do you love that he was here?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's just this slight ever so
slight perspective change, which I'm sure
[SPEAKER_09]: it's probably one of the reasons we all
love cannabis, you know, shutting off the
[SPEAKER_09]: background sound and all the sort of
manipulations and all that sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost like good versus evil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just want to shut off the evil for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a little hoot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You open your mind and you can start
becoming more open to these concepts and
[SPEAKER_09]: these ideas that life is a little deeper
than than you may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to share my last, my only ketamine
trip I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Empower Health Group
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a clinical staff day and part of
my journey was grief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found myself on the River Styx in my
journey on my cosmic canoe, I called it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's this feeling that you're
constantly moving and you can't hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was on the River Styx and I was
floating on the grief river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the message to me was the grief is the
love and the love is the buoyancy that
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps you afloat on this grief river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a juxtaposition,
but it's such a beautiful compliment of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't grieve as deep if you
didn't love as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it hurts so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the beauty of grief,
too, is, you know, it's it's always with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you carry it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though more time goes by,
I love the analogy that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grief is kind of like, you know,
this this stone that you carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like so encapsulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so acute, especially in your
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your your beautiful dog passed
away only three months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like as time goes on,
you have more space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that rock remains the same or that
stone remains the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grief you get to carry with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a representation of your love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in our culture, we don't honor
grief as much as we should, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we have timelines on it or should look
a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grief is just so ineffable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's not linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes you'll get a smell or
a sound or a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take you right back into those
moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like your brief frame where you
can celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that for you, Selena, that you
really stared in the face of grief in a
[SPEAKER_09]: different way, doing end of life,
both your grandfather and your grandmother
[SPEAKER_09]: in home.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is like beyond like angel status.
[SPEAKER_09]: The palliative care that you offered them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that grief was being experienced
through the entire process, obviously,
[SPEAKER_09]: to the end and on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't run away from something like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You face it head on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can once again get you can get deeper
in to the to the experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was terrified of grief.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got hit with grief when my father was
was killed suddenly with his wife on a
[SPEAKER_09]: motorcycle that I had bought him for his
50th birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had this accident and they both
passed away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, grief was like a shovel in my
face.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had never really been forced to to stare
at it before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was it was a little bit
shocking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see how people would want to run
away from it or maybe get confused by it
[SPEAKER_09]: and think that it was a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think as what's his name here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Floundy said here in chat, what did he
say?
[SPEAKER_09]: The worse, the worse that it is,
the luckier you were for your grief.
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow Bundy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and especially in your circumstance,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it went like with my grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a slow grief process,
you know, and with dementia, you slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: watch this person slip away while they're
still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for you, it was like a shovel in
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, boom, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you able to lean into it and go
into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you run from it for a while until
it finally caught up?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think I did run from it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I pretty much faced it right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say like at the funeral,
I was kind of like the the movie where you
[SPEAKER_09]: see the Italian woman in all black with
the veil over her face and she's like
[SPEAKER_09]: crying on top of the casket.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was basically her like just like I don't
think I had pride for I don't even know,
[SPEAKER_09]: like maybe 15 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was the most incredible release of
emotion and deep sadness and kind of just
[SPEAKER_09]: like, whoa, like my dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a great relationship with my
dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad was super mentor, super awesome
man, super, you know, like just very
[SPEAKER_09]: hardworking and all of his his ethics and
morals got kind of put into me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I looked up to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a fireman.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he was like a hero.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the day I was born, he was in
his first fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: He became the youngest fire chief in
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada at 48 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did that because he went and took
while after leaving my mom, getting
[SPEAKER_09]: together with a new woman who also had
three kids plus his two kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: He took his GED, his master, his Bachelor
of Science and his master's in business in
[SPEAKER_09]: like two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would see him at the kitchen table
just like working so hard, like crazy
[SPEAKER_09]: style for like five hours after a full
shift.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he also owned his own business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he was a fireman, but he drove semi for
a buddy who owned a semi.
[SPEAKER_09]: He drove limousines for hearses for my
grandpa who owned a funeral home and he
[SPEAKER_09]: owned his own fencing and decking company.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he built fences and decks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And often the people that wouldn't be able
to afford those fences and decks,
[SPEAKER_09]: he'd just swallow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he was like extremely hardworking.
[SPEAKER_09]: If any of you knew my dad, you'd be like,
oh, OK, so that's why you're kind of like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I get to see him in me and I get to see
him in my sister.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm much more on the happy he was here
than sad that he's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you get comfortable with it,
they're never really gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if he was gone, I wouldn't be
talking about him right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you keep him alive by talking
about him, by sharing those memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can I ask, like, what was one of the
I mean, I'm sure there's so many events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was one of the gifts or the gems that
you got out of having that relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, he's your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, what was some of the juice of
what he was able to give to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you feel very safe when you grow up.
[SPEAKER_09]: With a father like that, you know,
you learn about strength, you learn about,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, doing doing right by people and
proper manners and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: his gifts were his his sense of humor.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was my dad was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_09]: He would he had a classic thing where he
would kind of, you know, tell a long joke,
[SPEAKER_09]: hit the punch line, get the whole room
laughing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you kind of pull his pants up a
couple of times and walk out of the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And although it sounds funny, he literally
did that thousands of times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just watched him do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just the way his timing was with
his jokes, that he'd kind of like,
[SPEAKER_09]: leave the room when he hit a real good
punch line.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was something that I'll always be
reminiscent of and happy of just good
[SPEAKER_09]: times, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the things that I took from
Oman Opa, I mean, they both survived the
[SPEAKER_00]: Holocaust, so that's pretty crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they always talked about looking,
you know, for the sunshine in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking on the brighter side of life,
always looking for that like little that
[SPEAKER_00]: little silver lining and everything,
you know, and considering they had
[SPEAKER_00]: survived such horrific circumstances,
it was always looking for like the the
[SPEAKER_00]: juice out of life of the moment,
you know, really enjoying that cake or
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoying that visit or really being
present, you know, and just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: simple things, the things that you can't
buy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I carry that with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the things that you can't buy,
it's because money is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like once you're focused on that and
we all have to kind of be focused on it to
[SPEAKER_09]: a degree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, thoughts and prayers haven't paid
my mortgage ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I wish that it did.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got to hustle and I got to make
money on the same on the same side.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is definitely a strange thing that
the the working and the making money,
[SPEAKER_09]: unless you're really doing something that
you love, can just rob your your soul of
[SPEAKER_09]: all that juice that you're actually here
trying to find in the first place.
[SPEAKER_09]: So and it's funny that you say the juice
because today's panel is really kind of we
[SPEAKER_09]: wanted, you know, we invited Mason to talk
about breeding and feno hunting and really
[SPEAKER_09]: to talk about the juice, you know,
the good part.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he even showed some of his juice
earlier is like, yeah, I grew this.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looked like ridiculous rosin,
by the way, dude, super fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just full circle, even
metaphorically, as we get into a deeper
[SPEAKER_09]: level of conversation here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about things we don't often talk
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you, Selena, for bringing the
feminine energy into the house and
[SPEAKER_09]: bringing the just the nicer, slower,
vibratory frequency.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I see Mark with his furrowed brow,
as I say that, is both Mark and I are
[SPEAKER_09]: like.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice to be slowed down every once
in a while, right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can speed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in your hummingbird mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's been showing his cats and his
dog.
[SPEAKER_09]: See, he knows he knows the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cat and the dog.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have four cats and two dogs,
a tortoise and a goat at this house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my other house has like 40
chickens, two dogs and a farm cat,
[SPEAKER_03]: guarding cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got I got too many animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeding the goat, some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got good fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you guys, if you had any insight
or advice or words of wisdom for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to get involved in reading and
producing different cultivars and
[SPEAKER_00]: different just to really like be of
service to this plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just experiment like I'm so inspired
by your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even your plants that are laid
over and you're just letting them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any words of wisdom for people
that are watching this that are inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of sounds cliche,
but like easy does it just do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop some seeds, you know, a lot of people
try to replicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like perfection per se, but like if it's
your first time, it's never going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my thing was just it's it's like
we can know all the jargon, all the info,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the history, but it's going to be hard
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be filling pots up with dirt
and, you know, watering them every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it's hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you could do a little bit at a
time and be special at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll become more privy if you're
like, you know, just taking more risk and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting more energy into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of risk is involved because of
legality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, yeah, you might have to take
a risk, you know, or else you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be subjected to growing six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's not abundant at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to learn much growing six
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like just do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you finally to like to go where
you want to go and sit where you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: sit with, you know, all the breeders and
the who's who's or you could just be who
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to be and just like kick back,
make dope shit, you know, and keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone knows what they got.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that and just like highlighting
unique stuff or preserving dope stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: do what you want to do, but just do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a super cliche, but you just got to
do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's accurate for the most part.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good way to explain to
people that, you know, Johnny B taught me
[SPEAKER_09]: exactly what you just said, which was,
you know, everyone's trying to strive for
[SPEAKER_09]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I started my YouTube channel,
I was literally just trying to make not
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect, not perfect videos, but I would
definitely like clean anything out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would control the shot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would edit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted it to be what I wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Johnny B would come and he would
film with me all the time and we would get
[SPEAKER_09]: some views and, you know, got the channel
up to like a hundred thousand at one point
[SPEAKER_09]: in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that point, John was like,
Oh, I'm going to, Oh, I think I actually,
[SPEAKER_09]: the channel was up around 70,000,
maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_09]: And John was like, Oh, I'm going to,
I want to start, you know, doing this too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, well, you should do,
this is the camera I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the computer I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the software I use.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how I use it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then he went and started doing some
cool videos and his videos were different
[SPEAKER_09]: because he's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's super relatable.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's making hash in his basement.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like dirty laundry hanging from
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a bomb went off in this
guy's house and it's just authentic and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's relatable and it's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here I am creating this unrelatable,
unreal, you know, over, overlooking the
[SPEAKER_09]: ocean, making hash on the boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, I still got views, but not the
way Johnny B got views.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B beat me to a hundred thousand
view followers on, on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just driving me nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like putting all this work and energy
into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it might've been my wife that
was kind of explained like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: like perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, why are you so obsessed with this
perfection?
[SPEAKER_09]: Even with hash church, the first time I
started hash church, I did it 162 times in
[SPEAKER_09]: a row without missing a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot imagine how much stress and
grief that caused me in different
[SPEAKER_09]: countries without internet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I would stress the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my wife would be like, what is your
deal, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you so obsessed with doing the
show at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: PST when you're not even on the West
coast, you're in fucking Amsterdam or
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica or Panama for Christ's sake.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a good lesson that Johnny B
taught me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much more important to just do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Instagram, it's good to see
you using Instagram differently because I
[SPEAKER_09]: think a lot of people use Instagram for
podium wins.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about not exposing your faults
and not exposing your mistakes and not,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's the value.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the juice Selena was talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: The mistakes are what we want to hear
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to see you on the podium.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on the podium every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm feeling great about my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how people see that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's non-relatable, but when they can,
Johnny B would come out and he would just
[SPEAKER_09]: be like, well, my garden's got mites
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just like just like totally
expose his shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I got powdery mildew again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's that grapevine that's
hanging out my house.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bubble man told me to cut down 15
years ago, but I keep getting this fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: powdery mildew and people loved him for
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sure, you're watching those
videos of perfect grows and perfect
[SPEAKER_09]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: But people that don't have that,
that's not maybe it's giving them some
[SPEAKER_09]: inspiration.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think more so it's making them feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like the frequency of the
algorithm is that it creates envy and it
[SPEAKER_09]: creates just a, not a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I like about you Mase is that you're
just doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even showing your grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also loved it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it doesn't have to be like this
obsessive compulsive perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like beauty comes out of the imperfect,
you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it's also what kids need
to learn these days that imagination comes
[SPEAKER_09]: out of boredom.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't have boredom,
you will kill your imagination.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're watching, get your kid off
their fucking tablet or the phone or the
[SPEAKER_09]: computer, because that is the murderer of
imagination.
[SPEAKER_09]: And imagination is the creation of happy
children.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, unless they're watching Hash Church,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, unless they're watching Hash Church
just for a couple hours, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, you know, like the six to eight
hours a day on the tablet, it's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my son only likes six hours.
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a Facebook memory.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know how in your Facebook feed you'll
get like, oh, six years ago you were doing
[SPEAKER_16]: this.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just maybe like about a week or so
ago I got this.
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 years ago when Horatio had first
reached out to me and said, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_16]: Tony V's up here talking all kinds of
terpene stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you come up on Hash Church and set
this guy straight?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was like, I think maybe like
October 23rd, 2014 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was that son.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's been 10 years, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been 10 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Horatio hit me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you to invite my friend,
Dr. Mark Saldone onto Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, invite him on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit that I opened Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_16]: Gosh, that was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard to believe it's been 10 years.
[SPEAKER_16]: So how many years in a row did you,
like how many consecutive episodes was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like 162.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was three years, just over
three years of not missing a Sunday.
Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe just under three years,
but it was 162.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, I was very relieved.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even recently, Sam earlier this morning
was like, why did you decide to like stop
[SPEAKER_09]: doing Hash Church and why did you decide
to start doing it again?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just go with the feeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't, it wasn't hitting the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, you know, I just, I thought
everyone needs a break to go do their own
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then there was a 2.0, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So at some point you brought it back.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at some point the channel got
hijacked by some Bitcoin right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was bit, bit finance.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a scam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was me at ski school in Whistler
dropping my kid off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get this YouTube video and it,
it was like, I got an email from YouTube
[SPEAKER_09]: and I never get got by this stuff,
but I, in an instant clicked the link and
[SPEAKER_09]: that was it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The channel was gone in an instant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a shout out to the gentleman from
Russia who helped me get the majority of
[SPEAKER_09]: my videos back because there was a guy
from Russia who had ripped all of the Hash
[SPEAKER_09]: Church videos, like all of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, no, no, not just all of Hash
Church, sorry, all of my YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got me like hundreds of YouTube videos
back because towards the end of that scam,
[SPEAKER_09]: the guy started deleting my videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd go on every day and I'd be like,
oh no.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he, he deleted like 15 million views in
videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why my views are like 32
million or something instead of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the close to 50 that they would
be at.
[SPEAKER_09]: If, if those didn't get deleted.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also learned in that experience,
when I lost my YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_09]: that I do not like my YouTube channel does
not define me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And although I was bummed about it more
for Hash Church than anything,
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also on the flip side, like,
well, I could just do this again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could just start another channel.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the minute I accepted that way of
thinking, the sooner I figured out,
[SPEAKER_09]: like people reached out, they gave me
links to click on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually got in touch with someone at
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got me my YouTube channel back with,
you know, 600 of the thousand videos that
[SPEAKER_09]: were on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this Russian dude popped out of
nowhere and was like, Hey, I've got like
[SPEAKER_09]: at least four or 500 of your videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think he was maybe missing like,
like a dozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, it's neat how the world can have
your back out there from, from any given
[SPEAKER_09]: location.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love that, uh, that Edgar's in
fucking straight out of Compton,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is so fucking awesome that you're
just smashing it in Compton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, uh, something wild as you're
talking about this Russian dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to quickly introduce Drake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drake is the grower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned how to grow from him.
[SPEAKER_14]: From this.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, I grew up with Judom.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the, uh, the son of the KNF
practitioner, Master Cho, Hankyu Cho,
[SPEAKER_14]: his son, Young Sang Cho came up with
Judom.
[SPEAKER_14]: The information that I've acquired on this
was from that same individual who still
[SPEAKER_14]: going to be a little bit cautious with due
to where they're at in the world,
[SPEAKER_14]: um, with information, but yeah,
all the information I got over the last
[SPEAKER_14]: like three and a half years were from this
individual doing all these meetings on the
[SPEAKER_14]: daily, uh, zoom in and, uh, yeah,
I got to, I got to give so much kudos and
[SPEAKER_14]: respect to him.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if everyone can just take a minute and
put out some good energy and some,
[SPEAKER_14]: just some lovely vibes are in a really bad
spot and they may not even be around
[SPEAKER_14]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a long time with no contact.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but this is a really really lovely
individual going through a lot of,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, a lot of stuff on their end,
but it's still willing to put time in for
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, and just, yeah, big loves,
big ups, and it's a pretty small world we
[SPEAKER_14]: live in.
[SPEAKER_14]: So kudos to you, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're watching this, I hope you are
positive message.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see a Tim brought a friend back.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I, uh, I have a, um, I have a meeting
of scientists from around the world of
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis that meets on Sundays at 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanted to introduce hash church to a
new doctor.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Dr. Ortega.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, his name is Arturo and he is from UC
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, he got his doctorate there and he is a
CRISPR scientist.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and he works in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanted to introduce Dr. Ortega to the
group and introduce y'all so you can ask
[SPEAKER_19]: questions because he's working on a very
interesting, uh, field of science,
[SPEAKER_19]: being a CRISPR scientist and working in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we talked about hoplating,
viroid diseases, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, Dr. Ortega, please introduce
yourself to the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, I, uh, like you can say,
I am a CRISPR scientist, molecular
[SPEAKER_15]: biologist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, um, my interest has always been in
plants, um, for trait improvement,
[SPEAKER_15]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my focus now is on, on cannabis and
hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I work for a company called,
uh, Max Gene, which is a sister company to
[SPEAKER_15]: my Florida DNA.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, some of you may be familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: They do, uh, pathogen testing for things
like hoplating, viroid for growers and
[SPEAKER_15]: such.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, right now we're, we're working on,
uh, establishing a platform to,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, gene edit, uh, cannabis for trait
improvement or to offer new traits to
[SPEAKER_15]: breeders and growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we've had some, uh, within the last
year, we've had some success with
[SPEAKER_15]: developing this protocol.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and we have some regenerating tissue
culture that has gene edits using CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, can see if I can share a photo.
[SPEAKER_15]: So everybody see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me make sure that sharing is,
uh, on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I mean, if you'd like or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course I would like, but
sometimes zoom has these weird defaults
[SPEAKER_09]: where it says only I can share.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to make sure it was
turned on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I can, uh, yeah, I can just send you
the photo and then you can share it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've set it up so you can share it,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can control what you want to share.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your camera's off too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if you realize that or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to turn it on by any means.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it's fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I prefer to have it off.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, we're not all sitting in
beautiful gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: See.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a few.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a few people that say they have
questions about CRISPR and cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll save those for after you've explained
what you're going to show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we can get into that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back Mojave.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Hey, while we're waiting for our
tour, it'll get that fired up.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to also mention to Masonic
man, cause we dropped off before I got to
[SPEAKER_17]: say a chance.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't get to meet you, but I did go to
your free seed day event, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was just the other day cataloging
all my seeds and I had just all these,
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, where did these come from?
[SPEAKER_17]: All these packs.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like pack, pack.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh dude, free seed day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just what a great thing you do to put
together this event brings all these
[SPEAKER_17]: people together and you guys give away so
many seeds and you create a space for
[SPEAKER_17]: people to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So just like big props for you on that,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming and supporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get one out in the East coast
with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to run one up together for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a regenerating cannabis plant that
we transformed with CRISPR and we targeted
[SPEAKER_15]: a gene called phyto-ED Satrace or PDS for
short.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when you mutate this gene,
typically the phenotype you see is an
[SPEAKER_15]: albino plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is just simply for proof of
concept.
[SPEAKER_15]: For our protocol.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so now we've also had some results
with other gene targets, one specifically
[SPEAKER_15]: for drought resistance.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're kind of right now trying to get
some insight from growers and other
[SPEAKER_15]: scientists on what kind of traits the
market's looking for that we can target.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you guys have any insights,
we'd be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big yields on hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: Trichome content.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oil content.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few that I've considered for
those traits.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one locus, gene locus,
that gives pottery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been shown in several other plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as trichomes, there's also one
that if you target it, we predict a
[SPEAKER_15]: specific gene, predict that a trichome
density will increase.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about type of trichome production?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like less bulbous and more capitate
sessile.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to look into what kind of genes the
trichome development are involved in.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what genes are involved in that
pathway?
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just cool that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a neat way to be able to look at the
plant and go, you know, deeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll always think of Terrence McKenna when
he said, how come the deeper in you go,
[SPEAKER_09]: the bigger it gets?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: More questions arise afterwards,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Wade had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, thanks Etienne.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't help but jump in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a little bit about crystal
technology and I'm assuming you're doing
[SPEAKER_13]: good practices on making sure some wild
variant doesn't get out into the other
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis plant population.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other thing I wanted to say
is hopefully, hopefully you're exploring
[SPEAKER_13]: some of the finer minor phytophenibonoid.
[SPEAKER_13]: The hemp industry is certainly exploring a
lot of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a patient and as a person who
pursues minor phytophenibonoids for my own
[SPEAKER_13]: benefit would love to see stronger plants
producing phytophenibonoids that are of
[SPEAKER_13]: interest to patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have standard practices to prevent
the release of these plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know the plants?
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything is in a confined space.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're actually just doing tissue
culture right now at the moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't actually grow to seed,
to flowering.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it doesn't, it never leaves the lab.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an open field or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as other phytophenibonoid
pathways, we are looking at those as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Possibility of conferring different
cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it gets very tricky when you start
perturbing those pathways because we're
[SPEAKER_15]: not sure what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have all these terpene
synthases.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have, you know, there's a lot like the
THC synthase and other cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: synthases are very redundant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you perturb one, the other one might
compensate for the loss of the other one,
[SPEAKER_15]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are exactly the kind of concerns
that I have.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for articulating that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are valid concerns for sure,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm cautious on both sides.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the idea of using science to go
deeper in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can, you know, if there's new
ways in the future that this technology
[SPEAKER_09]: can access information that we've sort of
been blind to, or maybe not blind to,
[SPEAKER_09]: but that took, it just seems like
everything's about either access or
[SPEAKER_09]: speeding up the access.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's one of the things that's,
that's what it's been like for hash making
[SPEAKER_09]: for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, once we figured out how to
isolate trichomes to a 99.9% ratio at
[SPEAKER_09]: right after that, it just became,
well, how fast can you do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in some respect, I feel like
breeding was there in the early two
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands where everyone was racing to
find like these fast finishers,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could, you know, you could
flip them faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, 2010 happened and we
started focusing on flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's, you know, flavor and
then potency as well is really,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really first potency now,
now flavor, I should say.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but it's really, you know,
we're at this real dichotomy right now
[SPEAKER_04]: where the plants themselves may not be the
best plants for growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: at scale because they're not resistant to
the problems that we see from pest
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure or you know, pathogen,
path, you know, pressure, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the last hash search,
we talked a lot about clone houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a good topic because in
some respect, and the reason I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: bring Maison is because, you know,
if you, if you continually just buy trays
[SPEAKER_04]: of things that exist that other people
have already ran your, your bottlenecking,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not only yourself, but also the
consumers around you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're making an environment that's
undesirable for them to go buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, exploring those varietals
and it going deeper to look deeper at what
[SPEAKER_04]: perhaps you might be able to do as a
farmer from, let's say, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred seeds or a thousand seeds from,
from Masonic or others.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were talking about S1s
earlier a little bit where I feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: CSI's S1s are some of the best seeds I've
seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of blown away when we first ran
some of his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this was really odd.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was eye-opening for me, you know,
historically, you know, in our,
[SPEAKER_04]: our community in circles, we used to talk
down on S1s, you know, we used to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, they're not as strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to be as strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're weaker, you know,
and it's just our lack of understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: and of, of what, you know, genomics,
it really truly is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, we're, I think
someone said, said it last week,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we used to say, we know a lot
about a little, and now we know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or we know a lot, a lot about a little
about a lot and a lot about a little,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I think Mark said,
somebody said that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, yeah, we're on our way to
knowing nothing about everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's amazing with all that,
all of our expertise, we're, we're still
[SPEAKER_04]: searching for things that quite frankly,
I think we've seen before, but we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: isolating enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that there's more people growing
plants, you know, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: bottlenecking things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, looking at the gene
pool, looking at what, even going back to
[SPEAKER_04]: what Sam has contributed and all those
years ago, like it's incredible that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: today looking at the gene pool that we
have right now, you know, and still
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling from things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're, all of us are buying from
clone houses, you know, because it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's seeds out there that are
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that Masonic, you,
Edgar, you and others are really providing
[SPEAKER_04]: a pathway for people to really do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not taking the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people are aiming for
that perfect, you know, so, or it's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's, that's what people are
safe with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you go grab the clone,
you flip it, you know, why would you go?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that's been the standard,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And the problem is there isn't a whole
array of genetics available at a longitude
[SPEAKER_19]: and latitude that will max out in the way
that you need.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are, they are working on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just got off of meeting with a guy from
the USDA's germ plasma Institute and you
[SPEAKER_19]: know, they're growing over 500 variants.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in two weeks, I'll give y'all a report
along with pictures of the garden to give
[SPEAKER_19]: an understanding about, you know,
what they're doing because they've been
[SPEAKER_19]: collecting seed crops from around the
world and they're seeing early expressions
[SPEAKER_19]: of full seeded plants already.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's the end of August.
[SPEAKER_19]: And those are, he said from like Nepal and
Pakistan, Mojave.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, it's also, you know,
latitude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what Rob was saying on our meeting.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's, it's a key issue that
isn't being discussed because a lot of
[SPEAKER_19]: people are taking those European genetics
and thinking they're going to get that
[SPEAKER_19]: full expression in Louisiana, Mississippi,
or, you know, in other areas.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're finding that they're,
what their expectation is versus the
[SPEAKER_19]: reality they're getting is two different
things.
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the big problems in our industry is
that, you know, a lot of the breeding work
[SPEAKER_17]: and cultivation tech and stuff has been
done in controlled ag.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in controlled ag, we have a very
limited understanding of photo period and
[SPEAKER_17]: night interruption and trigger points.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's kind of an arbitrary thing that
bleeds over from a lot of crops,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is just add four to six hours of
extra light in your plants won't flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so that's what people do.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that for a lot of different crops.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just like add a bunch of light and
you guaranteed if you're growing a short
[SPEAKER_17]: day plant, it won't flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other thing that we do,
which is like an arbitrary thing is that
[SPEAKER_17]: if you give them 12 hours of light,
they will flower.
[SPEAKER_17]: So over the past 30, you know,
almost 40 years, we've been doing that as
[SPEAKER_17]: an industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And by following those guidelines,
we lost a lot of data points, which is how
[SPEAKER_17]: many hours a day does this really need to
not flower each cultivar, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's what tells you what
latitudes you can grow them.
[SPEAKER_17]: That tells you how many day hours they can
absorb in terms of photons, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of plants can easily flower 13,
13 and a half, 14 hours, 15 hours,
[SPEAKER_17]: 16 hours of daylight, and they still
flower, but they're not out of flowers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so that, that little, that one
piece of data that the USDA is like
[SPEAKER_17]: collecting on all these different
sessions, that helps shape the industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we weren't, we weren't able to do that
because we were all just in the closet or
[SPEAKER_17]: just running greenhouses with this
arbitrary number.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I've been screwing around with
night interruption with cannabis for
[SPEAKER_17]: years, and I never add more than 20
minutes a night to keep it from
[SPEAKER_17]: triggering.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I don't do is I don't collect the
data on every cultivar that says,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, at what point will this one
trigger?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, so there's a lot of,
there's a lot of really interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_17]: that we can do when you can do large scale
trials at multiple locations of the same
[SPEAKER_17]: variety, you know, but, and I'll just add
one other thing on the seed thing is back
[SPEAKER_17]: in the nineties, man, in the Dutch seed
world, the people who came, they all
[SPEAKER_17]: wanted the same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: They all wanted, you know, what do you,
what do you have that, that yields a lot
[SPEAKER_17]: is incredibly potent, really early and
resistant to mold.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like they wanted the
perfect scenario.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there were a few varieties that did
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the reality is most people did didn't
really focus for 30 years, the past 30
[SPEAKER_17]: years, they could have perfecting all of
that in one plant, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_17]: really what ultimately farmers want.
[SPEAKER_17]: They want just a few plants that have all
the traits that they want instead of
[SPEAKER_17]: having to pick through thousands of
different plants and thousands of
[SPEAKER_17]: different phenohunts in order to get to
their end game, which is a successful
[SPEAKER_17]: crop, not a failed crop, you know,
a crop that they can sell.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, that's why I think everyone,
I think that's we're now all collectively
[SPEAKER_17]: working on that now out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like, it's a really promising time
to be in cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's what the market is asking for.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Dr. Ortega, what is the industry asking
of your company if you're dealing in
[SPEAKER_19]: CRISPR and cannabis, what are they asking
y'all to do?
[SPEAKER_19]: Or what does the industry ask of the
CRISPR technology currently?
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we've had some requests for terpene
profiles, flavors, things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also resistance to certain diseases
like hobbling, viroid, powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_15]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it for now.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're just trying to get more insight
from more people.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the cannabis industry to kind of guide
us to our next projects once we now that
[SPEAKER_15]: we have this protocol pretty much
established.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a question, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, like from your vantage point,
where would you like to see this go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of advancements would you like
to develop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do you think that we can have these
in like real world applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, for example, you know,
patients with certain types of cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Parkinson's disease, or this symbiotic
relationship between cannabis as a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and humanity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we contribute to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see this going and what are
you excited about?
[SPEAKER_15]: So I see this going to generating new
traits for beneficial molecules.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, definitely, you know,
the plant itself right now, cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: plant, creates its very beneficial
molecules.
[SPEAKER_15]: for patients.
[SPEAKER_15]: And where I want to see it go is bringing
out those very those molecules that are
[SPEAKER_15]: not as abundant as like THC or CBD,
those kind of like hidden cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_15]: or even other things like flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's canflavin.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you guys have heard of
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a flavonoid that has some
anti-inflammatory and potentially
[SPEAKER_15]: anti-cancer properties.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I see it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see this going more towards the medical
side.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the secondary thing would be
like, you know, improving or augmenting
[SPEAKER_15]: the, you know, drug type cannabinoids like
THC, things like that, for consumers,
[SPEAKER_15]: for consumers, sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: As well as generating more sustainable
traits for growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, what if growers use half or a
quarter of the amount of fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_15]: water in their grows and that leads to
more sustainability?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you can generate a disease
resistant variety so the growers don't
[SPEAKER_15]: have to use pesticides or you know,
other compounds in their grows.
[SPEAKER_15]: So to sum it up, I see it going to medical
applications and also sustainability
[SPEAKER_15]: applications.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what I'm most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Arturo, I was talking about this
earlier in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it seems like some of the most incredible
cultivars come out of that rec market.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes from these obsessive compulsive
cannabis lovers that just are so obsessed
[SPEAKER_09]: with it and it's connected to probably
their olfactory and their level of sensory
[SPEAKER_09]: science that they're actually able to
perform.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're finding these incredible
flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I see what you're doing on that
side of things as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you ever look at, you know,
cultivars that are grown from the black
[SPEAKER_09]: and gray market, you know, that are all
these different sort of seed breeders to
[SPEAKER_09]: see, you know, these flavor profiles that
are winning these contests like Legends of
[SPEAKER_09]: Hash and the, you know, there's a hundred
of these different contests now that you
[SPEAKER_09]: can go to and you can enter your product
into.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's done properly, there's just
this real high level of enjoyment that
[SPEAKER_09]: comes from the recreational market that I
think has a huge and profound impact on
[SPEAKER_09]: the medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Market.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not coming from like pharma
companies, you know, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can split and do all this science and
it's amazing, but do you connect what
[SPEAKER_09]: you're doing to what these breeders are
doing and growing these unique cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars where you find things through
that, that the plant is naturally
[SPEAKER_09]: producing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you go back to CRISPR technology
and sort of put those two things together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I made that, you know,
an understanding question.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's actually what we want.
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are a very young company.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just had our one year anniversary
earlier this month.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wanted to establish this protocol,
this procedure first, before we kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: delve into all these growers that have
these specific varieties that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, have their flavor profiles and
their cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's definitely something that we want
to tap into and work with, with those
[SPEAKER_15]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching Point Break last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you know, you got to become
the surfer now, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: The Keanu Reeves version?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to become the surfer now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got to just dive in there and
like ride the waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to legends, go to Emerald, go like get
in the trenches, find out literally what
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's literally key note flavors that
everybody likes, you know, and that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: they identify them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't necessarily call them by their
scientific name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll grab a button and tell you it
smells like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be easier for you to do your
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking just knowing these like
things that we identify as and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: just getting in the trenches and learning
our jargon and applying it to your
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it'd just be that much easier for
you to explain to like, yo, Blue Dream,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're familiar with it,
but like that's very general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that just helps automatically with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as far as new strains are
concerned, like there's all these new ones
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from the archives, the blooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you'd go grab some of the more
newer strains that people are messing
[SPEAKER_03]: with, even though they might be like a
derivative of something old, but like a
[SPEAKER_03]: honey banana, you know, that's from like
2016, 2014, but it might be new to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's new to a lot of people, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all like just kind of just being
privy to the cycles and just applying it
[SPEAKER_03]: to the science and just like, why does
everybody love Skittles and rainbow belts
[SPEAKER_03]: and all these hybrids of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why does every why did Candy
Shishkevery win first place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Starburst good?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just grab all these, you know,
and then you would have to know and be in
[SPEAKER_03]: good graces because this is like a
different culture where we're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you don't have the real one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like we're still in that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but but money talks in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you go to the guy,
Mr. Skittles, Mr. Orange, Mr. What whoever
[SPEAKER_03]: made it, Mr. Wilson, you know,
Mr. Tropicana, Mr. Papaya, and you grab
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitty gritty, that'd be better for
your science because you'd be alluding to
[SPEAKER_03]: like the original piece, you know,
as opposed to like, oh, I got this from a
[SPEAKER_03]: duty set.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's probably papaya bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that it's less of or more of,
but it'd be better for.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not the yeah, it might not be the
original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's just my my two cents from
listening to that merge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it'd be a murder of you just
getting in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's definitely something that we have
to do, you know, we're just, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: we're not as steeped in the cannabis world
as as most of you all.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's definitely a deficiency that we
have.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's our we're coming to a point
where we would want to start that
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation with people and kind of get
out there to to these reunions and
[SPEAKER_15]: meetings and conferences or just,
you know, just by randomly meeting growers
[SPEAKER_15]: that have certain rights.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, you know, legacy varieties that they
might have that they've never shared with
[SPEAKER_15]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I got a question, Sam, you're the
you're the genetics master of masters.
[SPEAKER_19]: What would you like to see done with
CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_19]: Or what would you do with the CRISPR
technology?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's muted right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just see if he can mute.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good question, though, I'd like to
hear the answer to it as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll answer for him.
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it didn't he say years ago,
like trichomes the size of grapes that you
[SPEAKER_17]: could just pluck off?
[SPEAKER_19]: He did say that, yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Arturo, what's that possibility?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was looking at a gene to target
that could possibly have the trichomes
[SPEAKER_15]: grow not just on the buds and increase the
trichome density.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's uncharted waters right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have one for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want no clusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the plant just to produce trichomes
from the stock, all the leaves,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, no clusters at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can grow like billions of them next
to each other, like just plant as many
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds as we can so we can you can just and
it's just leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you don't have to wait for
flowering.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wait zero flowering time because that
does never happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, you've better
surface area for hash washing because
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just opening that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this this gene I've been thinking of
targeting.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was studied in tobacco as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And was found that when they knocked this
gene out, it did somewhat like what you're
[SPEAKER_15]: talking about, where the trichomes started
growing more on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not on the stock, but on the leaves
itself.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the reverse of that is no leaves
on the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the ABC plant does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you've seen anything mean stuff
that CSI did with it was the ABC times
[SPEAKER_04]: like KMD or GSC or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot more runs than success
rates in that population.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of what I saw that was successful,
there was just big clusters of flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: with like two or three families coming
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like from a finishing
commercialization point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could just like snip to trim to little
cuticles and you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, that would be to.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, yeah, because because of
what the restrictions on on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, legally, there was not a lot of
research done until recently on on the
[SPEAKER_15]: genes and pathways that might be
associated with, you know, flower
[SPEAKER_15]: architecture, flower formation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something that we will have to
empirically kind of figure out.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can take information from other
plants that have been studied and kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of guess what you know, if you target
this gene in a way that might result in
[SPEAKER_15]: this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like, oh, you know, if you want
a shorter inter length nodes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like what I'm alluding to is what
May said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, go get the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go basically go get that cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go sequence it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand what's there from a dynamic
point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could then that there's your
baseline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, but you got to get it from
reliable sources, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And kind of see like you can use a
technology called mapping by sequencing
[SPEAKER_15]: and kind of see which, you know,
genes might be involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you like you get a segregating
population of your the phenotype that
[SPEAKER_15]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you kind of like coordinate the the
potential genes that are involved in that
[SPEAKER_15]: phenotype.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should I text Kevin McCurn and I
was like, you should really come on right
[SPEAKER_04]: now, because this would be two wizards in
the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to get you guys talking because
we've done some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably be helpful to your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of towards at least the work
I've been doing is towards the end of sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of this ideology where it's like we're
pulling out certain traits and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at them and isolating them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the other thing I want to
bring up is like, OK, so we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, you know, we're really excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are the dangers of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is, you know, I think of like Herbert
Boyer, I think of Stanley Cohen,
[SPEAKER_04]: Rudolph, Jez Sawick, he's pronouncing his
last name right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking these people that started the
GMO world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like the inventors of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I read some things about them like a
year ago or so, a book about how they were
[SPEAKER_04]: mandated to make these changes based on
the desires of their clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, don't bruise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you know, tomatoes need to look
redder.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't look at the health impacts
of what that did to the actual plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: the fruit that it brought to life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if you're going to look
at this and I've been thinking about this
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot because the work that I've seen
medicinal genomics do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your duty to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: About what you're doing and why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's important to think about
this as you move forward, because you are
[SPEAKER_04]: holding a very dangerous but helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, call it concept, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got through your concept phase,
you think you can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I invite you to look at that because
of, you know, don't repeat history is what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and have you thought about that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, yeah, I've thought about the,
you know, ethical moral implications of
[SPEAKER_15]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, for one, am thinking about that
when I'm kind of planning the proposing
[SPEAKER_15]: projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's definitely so right now we do
everything fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's no nothing escapes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We autoclave our tissue after we're done
with it and everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the future, once we get to the
point where we're, you know, doing field
[SPEAKER_15]: trials outside or, you know, giving this a
variety that's been genetic to a breeder
[SPEAKER_15]: or a grower, there's that potential of
it's escaping and pollinating another grow
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhere next to wherever you're growing
or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it potential or is it like guaranteed?
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to like control pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sustainable brought this up about 10
minutes ago in the chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, Oh, these people obviously don't
understand the drawbacks and limitations
[SPEAKER_09]: of GMO, which he followed up with a quote
from Cho et al, which is off target
[SPEAKER_09]: mutagenesis is an emerging problem when
inducing site specific DNA breaks for
[SPEAKER_09]: genome editing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what would let's speak on that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's other.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you try to target a specific gene with
CRISPR, but there might be other sequences
[SPEAKER_15]: in the genome of the plant that might be
very similar to your gene target.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so those can be also targeted by
CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's computational methods that we
can use to predict off target effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: And before you release a gene editor
variety, you kind of try to also genotype
[SPEAKER_15]: those off target potential off target
sites and see if they've actually been
[SPEAKER_15]: been affected or not.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really depends on your gene target,
whether you're going to have off target
[SPEAKER_15]: sites.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes you have a specific,
we call it a guide RNA, which shuttles the
[SPEAKER_15]: CRISPR to your target site so it can
target your gene.
[SPEAKER_15]: So sometimes a specific gene target has
low potential for off target sites and
[SPEAKER_15]: some have a higher potential.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we consider that when we design our
CRISPR guide RNAs.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, like going back to what you were
saying about whether it's potential or
[SPEAKER_15]: guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So when Paul nation and things like that
will definitely make it almost guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something that we have to
address once we get there, whether we're
[SPEAKER_15]: just going to have all of this confined to
a space that's going to be sterile.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, there's going to be
procedures to to contain the cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: plants that have been gene edited and make
sure that the pollen doesn't get out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a tough one, you know, because we
just said, like, the best things come from
[SPEAKER_09]: our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as we get into these dangerous areas
where your mistakes can have these drastic
[SPEAKER_09]: effects, it's just human nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you land on something and it has any
negative, everyone will jump on your
[SPEAKER_09]: throat and say, I told you so.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you create something that's life
changing and really affects people's lives
[SPEAKER_09]: on a massive scale, people will be like,
oh, yeah, you know, I pretty much figured
[SPEAKER_09]: it was going to go that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I was a big supporter of this
technology the entire time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's this is why Dr. Arturo is part of
my science group and works with Rob and
[SPEAKER_19]: Mojave.
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the reasons why he's working
with us is because he's ethical and we're
[SPEAKER_19]: ethical and we want to keep that ethical
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I brought him here as well
so that the world could be aware of the
[SPEAKER_19]: work that he's doing, but also understand
that we're also trying to make sure the
[SPEAKER_19]: ethics and the proper stewardship are
followed along the way.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're as curious as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, Arturo, I think,
Dr. Arturo, you understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: the gravity and the fear.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, and that's why I brought you here
is to dispel some of the fear,
[SPEAKER_19]: because there's a lot of misinformation
about general misinformation.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we're at the tip of that spear.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this by exposure, it's putting sunlight
on it so that we could dissuade these
[SPEAKER_19]: fears.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so knowledge can rule the day as
opposed to shadows and fears and lies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I love what you're doing at Che in
the sense of bringing like mentoring,
[SPEAKER_09]: in a sense, guiding, offering guidance
offering kind of our perspective from our
[SPEAKER_09]: community to Dr. Arturo.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than judging, trolling,
you know, like kind of causing just like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, okay, look, these perspectives
are incredibly important and we should
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely bring them with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we don't want to do is isolate
ourselves completely from all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: people that are doing this work and really
have no say or no guidance or no helpful
[SPEAKER_09]: direction from the perspective of the
grower, the breeder, the hash maker,
[SPEAKER_09]: the community, if you will.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a really important point,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really believe that because on our last
week's call, you know, I definitely,
[SPEAKER_17]: I felt the energy around you.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of protection.
[SPEAKER_17]: We all feel like we have this,
we're stewards and we feel like this
[SPEAKER_17]: entitlement to protect the plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: But on the flip side of that is it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: The industry is what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: The direction it's heading is what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the people who are in charge,
it's a whole new wave and we want to have
[SPEAKER_17]: a seat.
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to continue to have a seat.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been along through this big arch
that this cannabis has gone through.
[SPEAKER_17]: And on the other end of that arch is going
to be something else.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we, that's kind of what we've all been
fighting for.
[SPEAKER_17]: But whether it's, whether it's
participating or getting just a seat at
[SPEAKER_17]: the table with the USDA or understanding
new technologies, new innovations and
[SPEAKER_17]: understanding how other industries have
treated all other plants, that's just
[SPEAKER_17]: acknowledging that this is the direction
that cannabis is now in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And our role is really has a big impact.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe the greatest impact is in that seat
at the table transition.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really believe that, you know,
because we see how industry goes.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've seen what has happened to other
crops in the past, you know.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just the nature of capitalism.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the nature of the world we live in,
the commodity driven international market.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why, you know, Canada had a really
big role in how the international market
[SPEAKER_17]: unfolded, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and California had a big role in
how the US market is unfolding.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the people who've taken the reins,
you know, they need, we need to still have
[SPEAKER_17]: a role in their understanding of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Sam, can you turn off the bit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Selena.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you turn the video off in the
background?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's echoing through your
microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I keep muting your microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll mute it until you can turn that
off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we want to hear from you for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Selena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to add is,
I think that's why it's so important to
[SPEAKER_06]: ask why are we doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had talked about, you know,
having these guardrails in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the bigger question is,
you know, why are we doing what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we really just, you know, trying to
find turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we really just looking for effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are we actually, what,
what is the end goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I like to imagine and
Marcus, you know, this, I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: altruistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that, you know, on a larger
scale, we're helping to liberate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're producing different cultivars and
phenotypes that maybe we haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to benefit humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really important to to
get back to the core of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if at the end of the
day, the thing that's driving us is let's
[SPEAKER_00]: make more money today than yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a much different why than how can
we benefit humanity and the planet as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, you know, from your
company's perspective, like, what is your
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so happy that we're having us talk
about ethics because it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: crucial, especially at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys defining your why?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your why?
[SPEAKER_15]: Our why is so we.
[SPEAKER_15]: We definitely are doing what we're doing
in order to provide or improve,
[SPEAKER_15]: not just, you know, not just cannabis,
but in the future, other crops,
[SPEAKER_15]: things like that, for the benefit of
humanity, specifically in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_15]: medical reasons, like I said before.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's definitely so we definitely want the
cannabis community to kind of guide us.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to just be like cynically
just, oh, it's just for the money kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And me specifically as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's that's my life philosophy,
I guess you can say.
[SPEAKER_15]: But.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we don't we don't just want you
know, this technology just to belong to,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, one company that's going to have
all the patent rights to, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: to be able to develop, you know,
cannabis using this procedure.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we definitely want to, you know,
develop something that the community can
[SPEAKER_15]: can use the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And.
[SPEAKER_15]: We so this is one of the reasons I came on
is to kind of extend my invitation to to
[SPEAKER_15]: hear from everybody in the cannabis
community, what their insights are,
[SPEAKER_15]: because what we're doing is kind of
uncharted waters right now.
So.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind if I ask to, you know,
beyond the way you'd already shared,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some of the guardrails to ensure
that you guys are operating as ethically
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainably as possible and really
like setting that tone and carving that
path?
[SPEAKER_00]: For, you know, other people or other
organizations that want to get involved at
[SPEAKER_00]: this scale.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, as scientists, we have to
develop standard operating procedures for
[SPEAKER_15]: the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we kind of use the.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Previous.
[SPEAKER_15]: Protocols for other crops.
[SPEAKER_15]: To kind of guide us into what we have to
do with respect to cannabis, like you
[SPEAKER_15]: don't make sure it doesn't get out from
our lab and make sure the tissue is dead
[SPEAKER_15]: before we dispose of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also are kind of use like the USDA's
guidelines as well for.
[SPEAKER_15]: For you, dealing with a potential
transgenic or gene edited plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, who's to say it's not out there
already?
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's to say that it hasn't, you know,
it's it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when we form our opinions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are our understanding of any given
subject, even if considered an expert in
[SPEAKER_09]: the subject is still very small.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's it's easy to judge these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's people that get triggered by even
the mere mention of CRISPR really quite
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of almost reminds me a little bit of
the the the vaccinated non vaccinated
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation in regards to the tension
that gets created and the judgment that
[SPEAKER_09]: gets clearly pushed through just the
digital screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade has something he wants to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to try to lift your mic up if you can,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't been very clear today,
but we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.
Can
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, way better.
[SPEAKER_19]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to start by saying thank you,
Arturo, for doing that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I expressed earlier my concerns about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have I have some friends who are in who
are doing similar work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Eleanor and Karen Bentley at anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know a little bit about CRISPR and
what I'm on the one hand, I feel cautious
[SPEAKER_12]: and I appreciate what I'm hearing and your
concern about keeping things in hand,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited, on the other hand,
because over the years we have bred
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis plants for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are limitations to some extent
on what we can really accomplish with
[SPEAKER_12]: straight up standard old school breeding
like Sam does.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are bringing a whole other possible
realm of, like I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_12]: minor finoconibinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure that the cannabis plant
produces compounds that will end up being
[SPEAKER_12]: of great interest in the medical community
and in patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's my excitement.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like what's likely is we'll end up
with some cannabinoids that have
[SPEAKER_12]: alphanumeric names for a while that turn
out to be really remarkably effective.
[SPEAKER_12]: D.D.
[SPEAKER_12]: Meary in Israel found a alphanumeric
cannabinoid that had really remarkable
[SPEAKER_12]: properties against 18 of 20 cancer cell
lines he was testing.
So.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a balancing act on the one hand,
deep appreciation for your ethics around
[SPEAKER_12]: and the patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from my own point of view,
excitement about what you might find in
[SPEAKER_12]: this plant we love so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll stop there and go back to
listening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's definitely so many things
that we can discover from this one plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the cannabinoid and terpium
pathways are like a way of the web.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're so interconnected and so complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_15]: So very hopeful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the future.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, some of these molecules that,
you know, these lesser of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_15]: you can potentially be used for as a
template for developing a new drug for,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, whatever disease, you know,
cancer or some inflammatory disease,
[SPEAKER_15]: chronic diseases, things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And with regards to CRISPR, I know some
people have their misgivings and they're
[SPEAKER_15]: cautious about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we do with CRISPR, you know,
gene editing of certain genes of the of
[SPEAKER_15]: the plant is something that could
potentially happen over thousands and
[SPEAKER_15]: millions of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Naturally, we're just kind of taking a
shortcut.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what the technology allows us to
do.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not doing anything or we're not
putting like the gene from, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, like a beetle or or for the
bacteria or anything like that into the
[SPEAKER_15]: plant and leaving it there indefinitely,
you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: So.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just taking a shortcut in a sense,
and we're we're using an enzyme that's
[SPEAKER_15]: found in nature and we're arming it to
target the genes that we want to target
[SPEAKER_15]: and for the for the benefit of humanity.
[SPEAKER_15]: So and CRISPR hasn't only been used in
plants, as you probably know, it's been
[SPEAKER_15]: used in the medical field in the past
year, I think, to cure some.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I forget what it was, but it's
something that somebody that was blind,
[SPEAKER_15]: they had cured their their blind.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a specific condition that they
had.
[SPEAKER_15]: They used CRISPR to to cure them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe they're also trying to use
it for sickle cell anemia as well.
So.
[SPEAKER_15]: But.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I understand people's hesitation to
kind of adopt this technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just want people to know that
there's there's scientists and people that
[SPEAKER_15]: are involved in this, you know,
the CRISPR world that are ethical and and
[SPEAKER_15]: moral and and you know, if there's any
controversy or issue, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: scientists as a community will will what's
it called?
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll put in a moratorium on certain
things like, you know, gene editing,
[SPEAKER_15]: using CRISPR in humans for for eugenics
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's definitely something that
community, the scientific community has
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of as a whole tried to prevent.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think with terms of with regards to
crops, there's something also similar to
[SPEAKER_15]: where, you know, scientists want to I
guess, ethically use the CRISPR technology
[SPEAKER_15]: to not confer any traits in plants that
will be like damaging to the environment
[SPEAKER_15]: or ecosystems and also to human health,
which is why, you know, in the past,
[SPEAKER_15]: whenever there was a GMO that was deployed
in a crop, there was several years of
[SPEAKER_15]: testing beforehand and field trials and
things like that before it was even
[SPEAKER_15]: brought to the market.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's definitely creating a
conversation in the chat room for anyone
[SPEAKER_09]: to read that they can check it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: Conversation is just people's opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that said, you know, the the I
keep going back to what I read when,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, essentially Herbert Boyer and
his other constituents were, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: much like you getting approached by,
you know, they're respectfully that your
[SPEAKER_04]: clients and they're like, hey,
we need a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way you went about it and are
going or they were going about it in their
[SPEAKER_04]: terms was they were going after less
bruising, easier transportation,
[SPEAKER_04]: faster flowering times, fruiting times,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, they didn't think about the
other aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure, they did all those testing,
to your point, and they did all these
[SPEAKER_04]: trials, but they weren't asking other
questions that were perhaps more important
[SPEAKER_04]: down the line that we didn't really
realize at the time or more importantly,
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't realize that at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as smart as they are and as brilliant
as the team was, they created crops and
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are less nutritious,
actually ended up doing the opposite in
[SPEAKER_04]: the long run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're in a dichotomy with with,
I would say, farming right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're looking backwards,
we're looking towards regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_04]: practices and learning, you know,
what what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you know, have you,
you know, again, I just we've talked a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: about what you can do, but have you,
are there any risks?
[SPEAKER_04]: And of those risks, I guess, more
precisely, of those risks, what is what
[SPEAKER_04]: have you found?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you found anything that is like,
hey, we shouldn't do this?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing that I can think of that
we've considered that might be that we're
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to target that might be a danger to
the environment or human health,
[SPEAKER_15]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how could you how could you know
that, like whether it would or not?
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like an impossibility.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of on the fence, you know,
I like the conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are very staunch in their belief
systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're either on one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sort of I'm similar to Wade in the
sense that it's like, yeah, definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: frightens me the potential the,
you know, the human error.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I think like, you know,
I think it's on this one conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's crisper.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then it's like, but everyone's like
consuming seed oils on a daily basis and
[SPEAKER_09]: people smoke radioactive tobacco and
people like consume alcohol as their
[SPEAKER_09]: number one recreational drug, which is
just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just like a brain cell killing like
I'll never forget growing up smoking weed
[SPEAKER_09]: and drunk adults being like, that shit
will kill your brain cells.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's an interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely can see how it's,
it's very human, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you've got humans that live in
teepees and live off the land.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have other humans that want
to build rocket ships and explore space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And generally, the ones that live off the
land are worried about the ones who are
[SPEAKER_09]: building the rocket ships that they're
going to just inadvertently destroy the
[SPEAKER_09]: land.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems like that's the kind of go
ahead, Mojave.
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I just comment on Arturo?
[SPEAKER_17]: And obviously, you you're more of an
expert than me, but maybe just comment on
[SPEAKER_17]: what Colin had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_17]: What you were specifically talking about
is a bottlenecking through a large ag tech
[SPEAKER_17]: breeding to create a better product,
a better commodity versus a better banana
[SPEAKER_17]: or something that's more nutritious.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that that that's an
interesting dichotomy with that and CRISPR
[SPEAKER_17]: style breeding and specifically,
which is that they are bottlenecking an
[SPEAKER_17]: entire genome by saying this banana
shipped better, forget all the other
[SPEAKER_17]: diversity and all got packaged in here
because what they're really looking for
[SPEAKER_17]: was mold resistance, shipping,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas what I'm assuming what CRISPR can
do is they actually target that particular
[SPEAKER_17]: trait.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not about bottlenecking the entire
genome into one commodity product.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about saying, okay, well,
if we could identify, for instance,
[SPEAKER_17]: what that was that we didn't want in the
banana, that shipping longevity,
[SPEAKER_17]: whatever, ripening speed or whatever,
and then apply that to all the other
[SPEAKER_17]: crops, then we didn't have to bottleneck
the entire gene pool.
[SPEAKER_17]: We could actually and with cannabis,
what I think makes an interesting
[SPEAKER_17]: discussion around CRISPR is we haven't
selected the cultivars yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's thousands and thousands of
cannabis cultivars that are at constant
[SPEAKER_17]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not the way it's going to work
forever.
[SPEAKER_17]: Eventually, there has to be a finite
number.
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the breeding work that's been done,
you have to pick your lane.
[SPEAKER_17]: So like, for instance, you look at the
companies that have put a lot of money
[SPEAKER_17]: into triploids.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great concept.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you didn't pick the right cultivars
and the right parent stock to do that
[SPEAKER_17]: improvement work on, and then three years
later, millions of dollars spent like,
[SPEAKER_17]: oh, that's not what the kids want to smoke
this year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Back to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_17]: But with gene editing, I'm assuming that
in theory that that one thing like what
[SPEAKER_17]: they learned with wheat or other crops
about branching applied to all the other
[SPEAKER_17]: crops because they identified that one
branch branching gene and said,
[SPEAKER_17]: we just have to find that same branching
gene in all these different crops.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the isolated nature of the selection,
it makes it even less risky in a sense
[SPEAKER_17]: than having to lump all genes together
into one cultivar variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Toro, if you could expand on that for
even the listeners so they understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm going to ask you these
questions to tee it up for you to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: deeper about what your work is and why you
feel like it's important to the work that
[SPEAKER_04]: all of us continue to do in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to explain it
because it's misunderstood in a huge way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think genomics in general and
cannabis are so far behind to Mojave's
[SPEAKER_04]: point where he alluded to we're just we're
not we've billions of varietals that are
[SPEAKER_04]: found every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, phenotype phenotypes found every
single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it's like a, you know,
it sounds impossible, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Impossible for for what to distill it down
into, let's say, 10 varietals,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're asking Rob Clark like, hey,
man, do you think we ever find like value
[SPEAKER_04]: in sativa's ever again?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, if we turn back time,
I guess we could, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, speaking back to what Mojave
mentioned about bottlenecking.
[SPEAKER_15]: So with this CRISPR technology,
you edit one gene or you can edit more
[SPEAKER_15]: than one simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that can be applied to not just one
variety, to several different varieties of
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that the potential for bottlenecking is
not there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like how he mentioned with with
banana, you know, banana, the Cavendish
[SPEAKER_15]: banana is just one clonal population.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's one genotype.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's, you know, if if a fungal
pathogen that's hyper virulent comes,
[SPEAKER_15]: it can devastate the entire banana.
[SPEAKER_15]: The crop industry in the entire world.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're looking at, like we want to
target genes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's definitely something.
It's.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's I guess it's traits that can be
deployed and not just one variety,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you get what I mean.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, I give me two different
varieties you're thinking of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go with papaya and sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are the like chemo types or what are
their properties?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one would, you know, one expresses
more of a karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mercy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy dominant profile with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the other ones more of a
fruity I'd say as it's more of an exotic
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit category.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's that's, you know,
in terms of the constituents that are in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, in terms of the terpene profiles,
I think would vary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, like, say, for example, like a trait
that's not even involving, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: the chemo type or anything that we want in
the background, we can apply it to both
[SPEAKER_15]: varieties, like, say, for example,
like the drought tolerance gene that we're
[SPEAKER_15]: looking into.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that we can potentially
apply to different varieties, not just
[SPEAKER_15]: like homing in on one variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can also like say you have a
certain variety that you want to use as
[SPEAKER_15]: breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can just target that one and then do a
breeding trial afterwards with to try to
[SPEAKER_15]: generate something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds to me like there's so there's
two different asks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the last guy has more consumer
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I want this profile to taste like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you just spoke on is more of a
I'm a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run business and I've got X amount to
spend on my crop this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I need a variety that is trout
resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to spend less on my nutrient
inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there so it's a lot more complicated
than that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I can't, you know, if a grower comes
to me and says, I want this specific
[SPEAKER_15]: flavor, put it in this variety that I
have.
[SPEAKER_15]: You wouldn't be able to do that with with
CRISPR, really, because it's so
[SPEAKER_15]: complicated, so complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm hearing is like, it'd be
better you use case for what your
[SPEAKER_04]: technology does is better use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use would be on the ag side where,
hey, I want to be mold resistant,
[SPEAKER_04]: drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because perhaps you're doing dry farming,
you're in part of the world where you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get much water.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's historically where cannabis was
grown at scale, arguably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Places where it didn't have a ton of
water, but had enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you should.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, you could target the you
know, the chemo type in the flavor
[SPEAKER_15]: profile, but it's just that, you know,
when you target those genes involved with
[SPEAKER_15]: that, you're just you're not going to know
what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so here's even another question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, let's say you did all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had varietals.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made a new papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say I grabbed a 10 pack of Masonic
seeds, Wilson F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cross that to your gene edited or your
CRISPR edited varietal.
[SPEAKER_04]: What then?
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you have to empirically look at the
phenotype of the progeny that you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm saying is, like, because you
did CRISPR on that, let's say it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: female.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that gene pool somehow limited or is
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What what would become of that,
in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, would it just go back to a
generation?
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mutations, are we adding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just like imagine like, OK,
we do a CRISPR edit of one gene in a
[SPEAKER_15]: variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then so it's going to be homozygous
mutation mutation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So then we cross it right with whatever
you want to cross it with.
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I've learned about cannabis on
certain varieties are very heterozygous
[SPEAKER_15]: around the entire genotype.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: The genome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's still going to be something new.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the progeny, because of all that
background.
[SPEAKER_15]: Heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're saying like you were asking if
there's a potential for there to be a
[SPEAKER_15]: bottlenecking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just bottlenecking or just you're
we're editing the genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things are missing by by design.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the progeny, it's going to be,
you know, the mutation that you put in and
[SPEAKER_15]: then the wild type mutation from the other
variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can see what happens when you do
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe there's like the, you know,
middle ground where you get the,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, a mild effect or whatever you're
trying to make.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the homozygous one.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the subsequent progeny will have the
full phenotype that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like imagine that it's just just just
picture like just a random mutation in a
[SPEAKER_15]: variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're just introducing that variety into,
you know, and crossing it with this other
[SPEAKER_15]: variety that you have.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think maybe some people have the
impression that when you target something
[SPEAKER_15]: like one gene or one target with CRISPR,
it's like it's really complicated.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to change the entire genome and
make something fixed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's not really the case,
especially when you just target one gene.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like to say for the like the PDS gene that
I showed, that's going to be consistent
[SPEAKER_15]: throughout every variety, no matter what
the genetic background, because that gene
[SPEAKER_15]: is so crucial for chlorophyll pigment
formation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So but that that won't necessarily be the
case for every gene that you target.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes you mutate a gene and then
there's another gene that's very similar.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or related to it that will compensate for
its loss.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you kind of have to after you edit a
gene, you have to kind of evaluate the
[SPEAKER_15]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't you can't really say,
like, oh, OK, if I target this gene,
[SPEAKER_15]: I know exactly what's going to happen in
the subsequent.
[SPEAKER_15]: A generation, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think you'll be able to edit CBD
synthase so it doesn't produce any THC the
[SPEAKER_01]: way it does now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can knock it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I know about this, the CBD
synthase, it's very similar to the THC
[SPEAKER_15]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some homology there.
So.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'd you'd want to know you don't want
CBD synthase to make CBD or to make THC to
[SPEAKER_15]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any zero THC.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you you you you don't want any THC in
the specific variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a CBD only variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I have CBD varieties that are about
40 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anything more than 10 percent CBD also
has THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's that's.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's certainly doable, but it's not
going to be as simple as just targeting
[SPEAKER_15]: and knocking out the.
[SPEAKER_15]: The CBD synthase gene, you'd have to go in
there and do precise edits on the amino
[SPEAKER_15]: acids that are in the protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that way you can if you
could, you could make 30 percent CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties with zero THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's going to.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would take some time to kind of
figure out, because since the CBD synthase
[SPEAKER_15]: enzyme is very similar to the THC synthase
one, you have to do very precise edits in
[SPEAKER_15]: the sequence so that it doesn't kind of
doesn't use the precursor to those
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoids to to direct it to to make
THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to be tricky, but it's
certainly doable with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've suspected it was, but most of
the other cannabinoids do not produce
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also potentially you could target
an enzyme that is up the pathway.
[SPEAKER_15]: So before you get to the CBD and the THC
synthases, you can you can edit that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I do know that for CBD there in
the terpene biosynthesis pathways,
[SPEAKER_15]: there's a there's a molecule that gets
shunted to the CBD pathway.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's potential of doing it that way,
kind of like circumventing the THC pathway
[SPEAKER_15]: that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just looking at the heterozygosity
of the moms that I have, and they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: around like one percent to one point
three, seven percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is point four, and that's the
point of Roja.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you still have a question,
Wade, or did we move too far away from
[SPEAKER_09]: that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.
Yes.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I understand about
CRISPR that I haven't heard you say,
[SPEAKER_12]: Arturo, is that most genes have more than
one effect in the organism in which they
[SPEAKER_12]: are found.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty rare that a gene only does one
thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: In both cases, yeah, it might have
multiple functions.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is one of the one of the ways,
if you will, that you explore new
[SPEAKER_12]: territory.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thing with organisms and CRISPR
technology.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so sometimes, especially in plants,
you have you can have duplication events.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a gene will be duplicated while the
plants evolving or the organisms evolving.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or it gets the duplication gets crossed
over into a different chromosome or
[SPEAKER_15]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you have the copy of that original
gene and that the new copy evolves into
[SPEAKER_15]: something else.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that new gene might have a whole new
function that benefits the plant or
[SPEAKER_15]: produces a new molecule.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in a way, that's something that you can
do with CRISPR as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's kind of a shortcut,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the only thing you're cutting off is
time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Selena has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious, how do we prove it out
over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked about your end goal being
about benefiting patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say to Colin's point,
we grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another piece of this that I'm
curious about anybody that wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: comment on this is the actual culture that
we're growing the plant in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's living soil or if it's in
cocoa, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at that, proving out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that we're gene editing for a
certain expression to help certain
[SPEAKER_00]: patients maybe mitigate certain symptoms
that are going through cancer therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we prove it out over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: What could those types of trial processes
look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we actually ultimately know
that when you're editing here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have this effect over here
indefinitely?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, too, you can edit over
here, but it might have some other effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering, how do you isolate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how would you prove it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way is human trials.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, with respect to editing a gene
and getting something completely
[SPEAKER_15]: different, some effect or new function.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's say for the chemo type or things
like that, you can evaluate the profile of
[SPEAKER_15]: those chemicals, of those molecules by
HPLC mass spec experiments and compare
[SPEAKER_15]: that to your original wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then let's say you produce a gene
editing plant that really overproduces
[SPEAKER_15]: this certain molecule that's very
beneficial and that scientists are looking
[SPEAKER_15]: at as an anti-cancer potential drug or
something.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you would pass that off to those
scientists that are more geared towards
[SPEAKER_15]: the medical field, and they would do some
additional research.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then eventually, if those preliminary
experiments are successful or they're
[SPEAKER_15]: promising, then they do the trials,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Medical trials, which I don't know
anything about, but how they're conducted.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it would definitely be a very
long process.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it's a very beneficial molecule and
it has a lot of potential, I think it's
[SPEAKER_15]: worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to mention, Arturo,
I saw you work on LinkedIn the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was really, really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can move on to other traits
that you can edit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Considering several different traits.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd definitely like to hear from you
guys for traits that might be worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_15]: To target.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a few of us have maybe pondered
this a few million hours in our minds over
[SPEAKER_04]: their existence in our life.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oil yield.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oil yield, tricum yield.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, just increasing the overall oil
production in the plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say it should be number one,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, I've seen Chris for edited plants,
which I, or maybe it was GMO, I forget
[SPEAKER_01]: which it was, but they were using the
genes in tobacco that make trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made four times as many
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the heads, each individual head
was a little bit smaller, but it also
[SPEAKER_01]: increased terpene and cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've all, we've seen really deeply in
photography,
[SPEAKER_04]: the capitate stock that is created from
the actual plant and the resin itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm wondering, and just asking the
question of the group, is there more room
[SPEAKER_04]: for more?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how would that even happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it seems like surface area would be
the constituent for allowing more to more,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least more resin to happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each resin head is also different
sized, depending on the variety and the
[SPEAKER_01]: method grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the ones that I saw definitely
had my volume four times as many,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they were counted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Arturo, you've seen that article
on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I think I mentioned before about
the, this specific gene in tobacco where
[SPEAKER_15]: they knocked it out and increased the
trichome density.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cannabis has a homolog in its genome
of that specific gene.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that could, not only would it could
potentially increase the trichome density,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it could have it have the cannabis
plant produce trichomes on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I do know that the, you know,
there are several genes involved in,
[SPEAKER_15]: in the trichome formation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So those, that's also another,
another potential pathway that we could
[SPEAKER_15]: target to kind of, I think somebody
mentioned a different type of,
[SPEAKER_15]: of trichome, like a bigger bulb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So is that, would that be more beneficial
to produce that instead of?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it just has a, it has a big head.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to just give you a quick little photo,
I can show you, this is a Astro Boy I grew
[SPEAKER_09]: some years ago, and it's just got the two
kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got the capitate stock, then it has
the Cecil, which is kind of over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have, well, the bulbous ones
are on this leaf and you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_09]: them as blurry circles.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're not really noticeable from a
perspective of hash making, using
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanical sifting, even liquid nitrogen
and getting extremely cold using water
[SPEAKER_09]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: These heads, the capitate stocks,
they just come off the easiest and so do
[SPEAKER_09]: the capitate Cecil's.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bulbous, because they don't have a
stock, although they do sit on a
[SPEAKER_09]: single-stipe cell, you can't really see it
with the naked eye or even a microscope.
[SPEAKER_09]: You end up, they don't have a stock,
they don't release as easy, they don't
[SPEAKER_09]: come off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I noticed as a hash maker,
that when I isolated them and did get them
[SPEAKER_09]: off, they weren't good.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were like not what I would consider
like high quality, inhalable trichome
[SPEAKER_09]: heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also believe, this is my own complete
and total theory, and it may be just
[SPEAKER_09]: cocky-pock, but when I ran cultivars
through dry sifting or wet washing that
[SPEAKER_09]: were CBD dominant, the yields were
incredibly low.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I always thought that was because A,
they were 50 plus percent bulbous heads
[SPEAKER_09]: under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking that's where that CBD was
in those heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did dry sift and water hash with
CBD varieties, because we developed the
[SPEAKER_01]: world's first CBD varieties, they all
consistently yielded lower for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, obviously with a solvent or
CO2 or some other way, you can get those.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was also kind of what led me to that
theory was the BHO community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I always had huge interactions
with the BHO community.
[SPEAKER_09]: People would be like, you know,
I ran this and got like a, this is back in
[SPEAKER_09]: the dry days, by the way, we weren't
running fresh frozen yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: People would be like, oh, I got like a 13%
yield when I made water hash out of it,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I got a 24% yield when I made oil out
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like oil wins, I'm doing oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, all right, well, that's
fucking interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of what led me to looking
for hash-making cultivars that had less of
[SPEAKER_09]: a visual production of bulbous heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had my microscope out and it was just
stacks of capotates and sessiles,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be like, that's the plant for me,
you know, nine out of 10 times anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it had a super high percentage of
bulbous heads, I just found that I didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: get the yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the yields that I did get just weren't
as juicy and as melty as the ones I got
[SPEAKER_09]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I constantly selected four as big heads as
possible, but on the end of a stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll tell you something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've said it before and I'm not
blowing smoke up his ass.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never smoked anything stronger than
Skunk Man Sam's Skunk Number One Pure Dry
[SPEAKER_09]: Sip, that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it almost knocked me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of my consciousness.
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost left my body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember trying very hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I can't pass out at Sam's
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: I better not shit myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I don't puke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like these were legitimate thoughts going
through my head when he first invited me
[SPEAKER_09]: over and was like, here, have a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's definitely trying to destroy me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this was Sam's nature back then,
1000%.
[SPEAKER_09]: He loaded that fucking thing up,
fired it up with a couple of matches.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was looking for utter and complete
destruction.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure he probably had a camera hidden
under the cushion to record it all once I
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking shimmied and had a seizure on his
living room floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give me some Bitcoin, I won't put
it public.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, the day after I was at
his house, the first time I was at the
[SPEAKER_09]: milk bag at my booth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if you remember this,
Sam, there was a guy next to me selling
[SPEAKER_09]: self hemploid hemploid t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a dude from America.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember where, but Sam stopped
by.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, hey, you want to smoke some
hash?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gave me another rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a big rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy took a rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this guy was no lightweight.
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy hit the floor so hard and shook
for like five to eight seconds before he
[SPEAKER_09]: got up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Selena, this was like happening
for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got back up and he was pale white and
he looked at Sam and he was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you to do that to this guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember Sam was like, no,
you can't do that to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a couple of my buddies were like,
did you hear what Sam said?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that was legendary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like back in the day, this was like 20
some odd years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like, that meant something to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I felt like I earned a stripe
on my belt because, and after that,
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tell you that I cannot count how
many people I knocked unconscious with
[SPEAKER_09]: bubble hash at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a weird time where, yeah,
there was oil, but oil was made by a weird
[SPEAKER_09]: guy with dirty fingernails in his garage
and no one ever got to see the process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just like the seventies and the
eighties oil guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It came in a bottle cap and sometimes they
didn't even take the plastic out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was way before BHO days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hit and that people were like excited
about oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really the strongest you could get,
unless you were skunk man Sam was like
[SPEAKER_09]: some shitty, you know, single screen
farmers hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was plenty oil in the
seventies from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was rare here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was rare here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the fact that someone went there
and knew what they were doing and filtered
[SPEAKER_09]: that through probably with like activated
charcoal or something to like clean that
[SPEAKER_09]: color out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they used cold solvents and they had
some of the tricks, but in, in,
[SPEAKER_09]: in Manitoba in the seventies and eighties,
like he got some hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw hash from those countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but generally there was nothing like
bubble hash available to the masses and
[SPEAKER_09]: bubble hash and BHO basically came out
within a couple of months of one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suddenly bubble hash is what really
changed the world because people still
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know about the static tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't able to create the dry
sift as, as high quality as you and I.
[SPEAKER_09]: Know how to make no, that's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're the anomaly of growing
exceptional flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: That process works really only best with
exceptional flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you use flour, that's less than
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_09]: The process seems less and less magical
and less exceptional.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas when you do it with like what you
were growing in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_09]: holy shit, dude, the amount of heads stuck
to the hand, the purity of those heads was
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: That changed the game, dude, because I
don't even think I took macro photographs
[SPEAKER_09]: of pure bubble hash before those pure dry
sift hash water has changed the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you could get it to bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't say that it didn't, but this
picture, the first time I shared it in
[SPEAKER_09]: 2008, nobody could fucking believe it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were just like, what the actual fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's some proper skunk man,
Sam skunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, like pure dry sift,
tiny little bit of stocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: He probably only did like three or four
passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well cured.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, instead of handling grapes,
you had to handle oil that was smear and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that, that photo was a game changer
for people.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one would stop thinking about the
process for a decade.
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole, the photo was definitely a part
of how people eventually kind of got onto
[SPEAKER_09]: it and figured it out with guys like,
uh, Tan and, and Mies, who was one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: first to really sort of show it with the,
uh, parchment wrapped around the DVD case.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, D420K was a part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a whole group of people just
playing around and focusing and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and enjoying these, these discoveries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wonder sometimes, you know,
that was an accidental discovery.
[SPEAKER_09]: These sometimes these accidental
discoveries are just the greatest thing
[SPEAKER_09]: that you could possibly ask for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accidental discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guy who was actually doing the
work, uh, with his hand, but it was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the high quality trichomes were
sticking to his hand from static tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't even realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went back to Amsterdam and wham bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it working really good, really fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll tell you how that changed my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you finally broke down and showed me
that, and I hope I didn't bug you too much
[SPEAKER_09]: for you to do so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I always tried to show respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wanted to tell you just in case I
died, I wanted to make sure somebody would
[SPEAKER_01]: pass it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I deeply appreciate it to be in that
guy, dude, because that day in your house
[SPEAKER_09]: was a mindblower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I saw that, I just started going
down this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, Oh my God, like there are
great secrets out there that people hold.
[SPEAKER_09]: That because of it, it changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can change the way you live.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you knew that secret.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it really opened me up to this,
like that there's way more going on in the
[SPEAKER_09]: world that people could possibly
understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not until you learn one of these
very, very simple secrets that really
[SPEAKER_09]: nobody knows that you realize like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's definitely great secrets out
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this is kind of metaphorically
that are just, if we could discover them,
[SPEAKER_09]: it would change everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our conversations, it would change,
you know, our understanding and it would
[SPEAKER_09]: change and pivot our pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly changed mine learning about
the cannabinoids pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the terping cannabinoid
combination that will really be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that and stuff like CRISPR and,
uh, doubled haploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, scientific breeding will lead the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, doesn't mean everybody has to smoke a
scientifically bred plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, it will be the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and you know what, as you say,
it will be the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It may very well be, but today the cutting
edge is fucking Edgar and Compton and his
[SPEAKER_09]: backyard fucking tossing seeds down like a
motherfucker telling everyone it's cliche,
[SPEAKER_09]: man, but just fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the cutting edge today.
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter what anyone says, put those
flavors against anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone's done with a CRISPR or any other
scientific process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they don't, they just don't hold up
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for now, Edgar, you win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of it, we win.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many seeds do you produce in a year?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're muted, Edgar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any, so like I'm allocated to so much
space and like when I do a pollination,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just gung-ho let it,
let it hit everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's, it's, it's not like,
you know, on, on, it's a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many plants I have at any
given moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I just always, I'm always popping,
always cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so it's a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a number for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made an average of five or 10 million a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably don't even, or decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't probably make a million a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I'm only, I only do it in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably make like, uh,
every year we're probably make like
[SPEAKER_03]: 250,000 to 500,000 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a lot away and I sold them all for
less than 10 cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you're growing 5 million.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of take from that credo where it's
all like, I have 500,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind selling them for,
you know, you know, less than a buck a
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, you know, and let alone the
free seed day where it's all like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I divvy up a thousand packages of my own
gear that I make.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage others to do the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just like all team up and we just
give away seeds and we revolve a day
[SPEAKER_03]: around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I take a page out of both of those and,
you know, respects to the OGs for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to walk in the million man march
in, uh, Amsterdam and I would take the
[SPEAKER_01]: kilo or two kilos of my scum seeds and
hand them out to anybody that wanted them
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the time I would hear people in
Dutch saying, Oh, these can't be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be henna seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'd answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just got handed a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got there, Mojave?
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I just wanted to show you guys this
plan.
[SPEAKER_17]: Since we were talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_17]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so Jim Goodwin gave me some,
uh, Mel Frank gave me some flower a couple
[SPEAKER_17]: of years ago, five years ago or so this
Cambodian, which I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: If someone had given it to him and he
trusted the source, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_17]: interesting, unique flower, very
equatorial, the way the plant grew.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, uh, anyway, I liked smoking it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he, he had it tested and it
turned out it was a one-to-one,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, CBD THC, but it was a one to one with
a really interesting kind of narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_17]: profile.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't your typical Harlequin ACDC
Afghani based one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was a really nice, refreshing high.
[SPEAKER_17]: And anyway, so I got some seeds out of the
flower and then he gave me some more seeds
[SPEAKER_17]: and then I popped them and I got this one
that I selected that what I really liked.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then I had one little sport that shot
off that had this, this mutation that
[SPEAKER_17]: would go either fully albino or half and
half.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or it would go just really beautiful
mosaic, which really I like as it just an
[SPEAKER_17]: ornamental plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but the cool thing is that it's a
mutation, but it's only in the sport,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only in the offshoot.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had cut it off and put it in a glass
of water and just was leaving there,
[SPEAKER_17]: just kind of just looking at it on my desk
for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I was on a call with Rob and ATN
and this other plant scientists.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, Oh, should I probably should
have cloned that, huh?
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I quickly, you know, right after
the call, I went and dipped it in some,
[SPEAKER_17]: and I cloned it and it made it after a
week.
[SPEAKER_17]: So just sitting in water.
[SPEAKER_17]: So now I have this mutation, which
consistently will show this weird
[SPEAKER_17]: variegation and mosaic and albinoism,
but it's only in this sport.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have, I have this cloned in other
versions that are just completely green.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but anyway, I just love it just
because for as an ornamental plant or as
[SPEAKER_17]: an interesting, just what cannabis can do
and how many plants come from sports.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if you, in the wine industry and all
the Pinot Grigio and all the white Pinot
[SPEAKER_17]: plants are Pinot Noirs that stopped
producing pigment or that particular
[SPEAKER_17]: pigment and became a new mutation,
which became a new clone, which eventually
[SPEAKER_17]: was reproduced millions and millions and
millions of times.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just the fun part of breeding
and selection where you get little weird
[SPEAKER_17]: little mutations.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a poplar enviroid,
but not.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's a mosaic.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it reminds me of like a caladium
or other ornamental plants and stuff like
[SPEAKER_17]: that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe the virus is mosaic virus
causing the spark, the spark, the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that are not white or green, but mixed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the thing is when I made the clones,
the ones that had too much too yellow,
[SPEAKER_17]: they just don't root because there's no
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_17]: They just wear in the propagator.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can only win.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're collecting your next generation.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every time you got to collect one that has
a little bit like these ones on top here
[SPEAKER_17]: and a little green and a little yellow.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if I collected from this branch,
it would just go back to just being green
[SPEAKER_17]: again.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, or possibly going back to being green.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, it's just, it's a, yeah,
funny.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's also, um, Sam, you might like
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's yellow stem, halfway yellow stem.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can see on the line, it's yellow
stem on one side and then green on the
[SPEAKER_17]: other.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: For Dr. Bocha.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got five more minutes till our four
hour mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got to thank everyone for coming and
chilling and sharing.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's anything else anyone wants to
say in the last five minutes, they can put
[SPEAKER_09]: their hand up or, or they can just hash
church tile shout at the top of their
[SPEAKER_09]: lungs over the other person and just
fucking push through and just get what you
[SPEAKER_09]: need to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say something really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say thank you to all of you
for growing this beautiful plant and for
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that are watching,
please share as many seeds as you possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the spirit of this plant is with us
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just really cool that,
um, we're just so inspired to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So free seed day, I feel like we should do
that every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but just thank you guys so much for
all their work and all your blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat and tears and love.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Marcus, check your, uh, the,
the chat there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I put, uh, Dr. Ortega's email in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to add him for a future hash
church discussions and Arturo,
[SPEAKER_19]: thank you for coming and, uh, spreading
your, uh, your, your truth about,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you know, CRISPR and what you're
working on and being very transparent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I brought you along because I knew you
would do a great job and I thank you for,
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, you know, coming in and taking it on
the chin and being a good ethical
[SPEAKER_19]: scientist that you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Love and appreciation, sir.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thanks to everybody for your questions
and your interest and for letting me,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, join you guys in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'd certainly like to come back and,
and hear more from, from all of you.
So.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you for coming for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, uh, Masonic for making it out and
chatting with us, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to get you back as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every, anytime you're doing a new
release or, you know, you got something
[SPEAKER_09]: new on the go, which sounds like every
minute of every day, uh, just fucking come
[SPEAKER_09]: by and share with us, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone, uh, love to have you next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do come in, try to come in on a
computer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you can also open up the YouTube,
uh, live because people were asking
[SPEAKER_09]: questions and talking about your packs in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I think you would have done quite
well to, uh, engage in the chat while you
[SPEAKER_09]: weren't talking in this particular chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll get you on again for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks everyone for coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really appreciate everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I appreciate all the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 265 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got almost everyone that was watching
live back over the course of the last
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people do appreciate the conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the idea of just, uh, having
everyone open to dialogue.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I saw one thing during the COVID-19
lockdowns was that the division and the
[SPEAKER_09]: shutting down of a part of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: In any subject is absolutely, um,
detrimental to the, to the benefit of,
[SPEAKER_09]: of humans.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's best for us to always be able to have
these conversations, whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not agree with them, but,
uh, it's, it's about learning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said it earlier in chat,
you know, um, without free will,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you can't have just good with
free will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Free will involves both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and it's only really our perspective
that makes them one or the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very thin veil.
[SPEAKER_09]: They live very close together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, the bottom line is, is you can't
have free will without both of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate the conversation today and
the dialogue and everyone coming and
[SPEAKER_09]: hanging out from, uh, Wade laughter
fucking love you buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just so pleased and happy that you
come and share your Sunday mornings with
[SPEAKER_09]: us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it can't always be easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know just having a small broken arm,
I'm uncomfortable sitting here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the discomfort that you have to
experience while you share your time with
[SPEAKER_09]: us, it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Dr. Mark, always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get you into some deeper
conversations, uh, this nest next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Mojave, thanks for showing your
plants and Colin for inviting Edgar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, uh, Brian, again, we're going
to get you talking one of these times more
[SPEAKER_09]: than just about your dogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear, I think that you and Edgar
would have had a great back and forth
[SPEAKER_09]: dialogue in regards to the different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys have a lot of similarities going
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you guys don't know each
other, you should definitely get in touch
[SPEAKER_09]: with this with each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to hook you guys up for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause, uh, well, his email is,
is, is also, I believe it's on the main
[SPEAKER_09]: email.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you guys to all have access to one
another.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that's another great part of past
church being able to reach out to anyone
[SPEAKER_09]: that's on the panel at any given time for
any reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's, that's the way that I see
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely reach out to one another.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys have an interest and anytime I
have someone that wants to reach out to
[SPEAKER_09]: one of you from the chat, I always hook it
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Via email as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Etienne, as always, thanks for bringing
in Arturo.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciated the conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know much about CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know about the, Ooh, CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, isn't that the GMO thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I didn't, I've never heard it be
discussed by someone like you Arturo.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate your patience with us and
your empathy that you're coming from with
[SPEAKER_09]: this process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally respect people's visions of
being slightly afraid of it and as they
[SPEAKER_09]: are with AI and any other change.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when we first came out with
Ross and people said we were ruining the
[SPEAKER_09]: resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were heating it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're destroying all the turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause Ross is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, skunk man, Sam, love you buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super stoked that you could make it here
today and be able to engage in the
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are truly one of the elders of this
community and you've helped birth so much
[SPEAKER_09]: of so much of what all of us are doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and I think it's important to respect
and acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, when our elders are alive,
not after they've passed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So every day I'll say it from the
treetops, dude, thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_09]: being you and just being fucking the
cannabis warrior that you've been probably
[SPEAKER_09]: most of your life, at least according to
the stories that your wife has told me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Selena, Colin, the whole group we're going
to, we're going to drop now, but next week
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll be gathering again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate you and may the full melt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless your bulls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sooner than later, because if it doesn't,
I'll be fucking sad for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.
