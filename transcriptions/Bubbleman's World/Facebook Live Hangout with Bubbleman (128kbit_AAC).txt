[SPEAKER_00]: How's everybody doing today in Facebook
land?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will as always give a few seconds or a
few minutes to Give everyone a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get into the room I always
realize that when I when I first start
[SPEAKER_00]: these chats I'm pretty much talking to
myself Although I you know I like to at
[SPEAKER_00]: least start talking because other people
are gonna come in and they're gonna watch
[SPEAKER_00]: this Not live, but they'll watch it
afterwards and there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 20 or 30 people in the room already
so welcome everybody Feel free to type
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Mariah Broughton and Nancy Budwell
have just joined I've got the Halo
[SPEAKER_00]: Sapphire dish as clean as clean can be can
you believe this dish has ever been used
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks new One of the things I love
about it Mark David in the house Dominique
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Patrick Craig Tunnelly Cheers Cheers
and more Cheers Spencer Kohler Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: Connerton always down for dabs with bubble
man What are we gonna talk about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just actually got a text From Eugene
Monroe he's the NFL player for the Ravens
[SPEAKER_00]: that donated $80,000 to promote cannabis
as a pain medication as an alternative to
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids We've got a good conversation that
we're gonna be having with him next week,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're excited You know I was
unfortunately sad to see that the Ravens
[SPEAKER_00]: let him go today really unfortunate They
said something like his his cause isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: our cause when it really should be their
cause because the bottom line is These
[SPEAKER_00]: football players are being drugged but
with opioids they're being sent out onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the field to destroy them themselves and
the bottom line is is that cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: work wonders for pain management and it
can also be a preventative for them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, so Yeah, he did indeed, but watch
more things from from mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boo bubbly as Eugene Monroe calls himself
That's his nickname boo bubbly huge bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash fan and a fan of all the things that
Tony and myself have been doing so we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to having a good
conversation with Mr. Monroe and it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: bad that that his team the Ravens just
didn't stand behind it because the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing historical work, so that's an NFL
players exactly it is all about the money
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly chilly you know drug them
right up It's that's the thing when they
[SPEAKER_00]: say they're worried about them being high
on the field They're already high on the
[SPEAKER_00]: field high on opioids, and that's kind of
a bit of a dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think it's time to get ready for a dab
I've been waiting all day for my wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: bake dab to do with you hello Nick Tello
and Martin Riggs and Derek Syand and Adam

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're having fun Nathan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it synthetic sapphire or how are they
sourcing the material?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are growing the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally grow these dishes How
fucking cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think blue river extracts dot-com
sells he ships to the UK Canada we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: ship to the UK as of yet But soon one day
I'm looking forward to breaking out Happy
[SPEAKER_00]: day Jake Lemure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to have another dab
Although that dab really did get my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: watering that was a lot of hash and a lot
of rosin and a turp dip It was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got over here We got some
purple candy Well, I like purple candy
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome Ross Kaplan Ross is a friend of
mine from Mount East.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be making his way across The
country in the near future and coming for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little visit to BC Good looking forward
to that Always nice to have friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the world come by Stuff is a little
bit a little bit buttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna need to put a little maybe
of this can of tonic resin on there just
[SPEAKER_00]: to Secure it There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Hate when it butters up and then it just
it doesn't want to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to you know, look like that
So you got to get a mixture in there Once
[SPEAKER_00]: you dip it into the turps Oh one thing
about this is the one nice thing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: butter is is that when you dip it into the
turps It literally absorbs the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the shatter it kind of just gently
slides out on the outside I'm working on
[SPEAKER_00]: that Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on that right now as we speak
I actually have to go to the courts either
[SPEAKER_00]: today or tomorrow to get some documents
and I'm working on it Doc keeps saying I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke marijuana and weed I correct him
refuse to call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Doc's don't always know What are the
best temperature ranges for concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally personal and it'll change
depending on what surface you're hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're hitting on are you hitting on
titanium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hitting on quartz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hitting on sapphire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hitting on ceramic or perhaps
silicon carbide all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: surface areas will have different
temperature sweet spots for Turpene
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the best way to do it is,
you know start around 400 and move your
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to 600 and find your sweet spot
because it's definitely going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: between 4 and 600 degrees Hey right on
Jeremy Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you digging them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do another rip Turp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what did I turp dip?
[SPEAKER_00]: I turp dipped Cali orange OG creamsicle
This one's this one's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Charlie Victor You use RO water for
bubble hash I've used All sorts of water
[SPEAKER_00]: for bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to use RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to use distilled I love to use
creek water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to use pure artesian spring water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used lake water I have used water
from waterfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used waters from rivers I will use
water from a dirty nasty shitty city if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to if I'm forced I'm not going to not
make the hash just because I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the best water but Using the best water is
obviously great when you can Creek waters
[SPEAKER_00]: proper spring waters proper RO waters
proper hard to beat RO But if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big RO machine and you just want to
make a batch It's not going to be the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I can't tell you how good that tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pure heaven that is pure Pure
heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even believe how good that tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow water is nice But you got to be
careful with snow water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to make sure you're in a
really clean environment because snow When
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing in the air will pick up
contaminant that's in the air all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty debris and dirt That's above cities
We get the snow from up on Whistler
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain up on the peak as well as the
black tusk Which is about another mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: range south of Whistler Mountain in the
Tantalus region And the black tusk has
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible snow when you melt it it melts
into clear water And that's always a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do with your snow take it and put
it in a clear glass of water put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: windowsill Let it melt and and look at it
afterwards Is it clean or is there a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of particulate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Floating and some sitting on the bottom of
the water because you do not want that
[SPEAKER_00]: Particulate that sort of product will sink
in your bubble bags and it'll end up
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminating your final product Shout out
to Soma who just came into the room
[SPEAKER_00]: brother from another mother I miss you
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't come to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to Amsterdam anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: When are we gonna hook up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to come to Amsterdam and hang out
with you fucking miss that guy known Soma
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 damn years Always got along with them
don't think we ever had a disagreement In
[SPEAKER_00]: all the years we've known each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't picture Soma getting mad at me
Always smiling yeah, everybody say hi to
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma Tony Verzua started Blue River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his company Tony is Blue River.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a quick breakdown on how
fast it happened He was playing around and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing little things, but he wasn't quite
on the right path K from trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies called me one day Where are
you K?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here's K right here So K from
trichome technologies called me one day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said bubble man you need to get on
the water hash Water terpenes the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are escaping into that water you need
to capture those and get it back into your
[SPEAKER_00]: hash It'll be the future of of hash I Took
that information and I said to Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what this terpene thing is the
real deal K's been working on it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while I think that you know if we could
figure out how to get the terpenes out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water it might be something that we
could you know really move forward in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and Tony was not really super
interested in that But I did tell him
[SPEAKER_00]: about the terpenes that day and I swear
less than a week later He had terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: like a week later, and that really was the
start of him making terpenes And he
[SPEAKER_00]: started you know first he started with a
simple steam distillation which anyone can
[SPEAKER_00]: start with you can make your own terpenes
They're just a they're not really a true
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule They're more what we would call
an artifact not an accurate representation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the molecule itself But more like a
shadow of what it once was due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cause of the heat affecting and changing
the molecules Then he learned to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: some different processes, and I'm sure he
must have gone through like a hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion or a vac diffusion There's all
sorts of different things that people do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world of chemistry, and you can
just google it up We've posted some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in all things terpenes hydro
diffusion vac diffusion steam distillation
[SPEAKER_00]: cold trapping people are cold trapping
from slabs that are Vacked out in ovens or
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dryers these are all different ways
that people are Doing it and then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course Tony's invented his own way to
create the brand of terpenes that he has
[SPEAKER_00]: now Which is kind of why Blue River is a
bit a bit standalone ish right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too many companies in the same
In the same on the same level and for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just asked him hey, you know Canadians
need this product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to represent Canada I mean I'd
love to represent Europe for that matter I
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proponent of the Blue River
terpenes, so I Started my company Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: River Extracts Canada Just a couple of
months ago and the websites up Blue River
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts dot ca you can check it out
welcome Dustin Halderson and Alexander

[SPEAKER_00]: director of this show It's just something
I did on a whim and then you guys loved it
[SPEAKER_00]: so much that I feel this Incredible
pressure to now do it every Sunday even
[SPEAKER_00]: this Sunday, which is Father's Day of
course I'll do hash church of course we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have people in hash church telling their
stories and Yeah, cuz people need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired Every day of the week that is for
sure So let me know both Alexander and
[SPEAKER_00]: Christopher When would be a good Sunday to

[SPEAKER_00]: definitely like There'll be stories that
you want that you want to hear for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I just forget sometimes and I don't
have Relationships with you guys where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you every single day so Sundays
come and go real fast for me So if you

easier for me where even if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones just let me know a Sunday
that you can come and you can be On and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll pen you in and it's it's very
important for the audience that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: say you can you're gonna be there That you
make the point on being there that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make the point on having a headset that
you don't come in on a phone But you come
[SPEAKER_00]: in on a computer and even maybe check a
day or two before Sunday we can do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little You know pre run where I open up a
Google chat And I send you the link and we
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you can get in without Your
microphone ringing and bleeping and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different things that sometimes end
up happening on hash church, so I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up Or making it a little bit more
professional, but like I say this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: my profession I'm a hash processor that
just happens to had to have learned
[SPEAKER_00]: photography So I could show you the photo
so I could show you what I was dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with and what I was making You know the
purity of it and whatnot and now the
[SPEAKER_00]: videography and the audio and the
directing of like a live show or producing
[SPEAKER_00]: it just becomes a lot to try and To try
and deal with okay, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question chase will blue river turps
evaporate if the lid is left off for
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, okay, I'm not gonna be sarcastic
when I ask you these questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Turpenes are volatile so they're
almost Evaporating at room temperature so
[SPEAKER_00]: yes is the answer right off the bat of
course they will and in fact Even being
[SPEAKER_00]: left at room temperature versus being left
in a fridge or a freezer will change their
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction When you leave the lid off and
you can smell the terpenes in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: that's answering your question for you the
fact that those molecules are continually
[SPEAKER_00]: continually escaping out into the air into
the atmosphere and that you can smell them
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the that's how you know they're
Evaporating that they are escaping and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep the lid on and you can't smell
them well, then you know they are where
[SPEAKER_00]: they belong Terp terp Can you vote for a
Canadian for US president?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that if they could you know what
fuck that our Prime Minister He seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a good dude, but I don't know if he's
you'd want him to be your president
[SPEAKER_00]: because He people have are having a
problem with him right now And he's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know he went and said he was gonna do all
this stuff for cannabis and now he is
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into effect But unfortunately
people are still being arrested for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and that's something that we all
feel that maybe right off the bat he
[SPEAKER_00]: should have Quietly told the RCMP and and
the policing listen no more busts for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis possession now I understand
making that a public statement would be
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy because people would just All open
up dispensaries and selling weed
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere because people are gung-ho to
make what they can make off this before it
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes and I had this sort of discussion
earlier with someone saying oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna lock it all up They're gonna
own it all they're gonna make all the
[SPEAKER_00]: profit and I was like, okay First of all,
who is they second of all who fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cares who makes the profit if it's
accessible to everyone like if I could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: High quality resins in all sorts of
different cultivars land race and long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cultivars Included and they were
at a reasonable price I would be so happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that because I know how hard it is
for me to collect Keep club keep clones
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh now I'm a mothering room and then
flowering and vegging now I'm a vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: room and a flowering room plus a mothering
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a full-time job Let alone
being a father having businesses all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other things I need to do It's not
that easy to do he should stop the arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, but making it a public
statement people Would go fucking nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: Alexi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be like selling everything
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happened when they gave licenses
to grow cannabis Just licenses to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for our own personal needs Look
how much that changed everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped the price of weed because those
licenses all that herb that was grown Got
[SPEAKER_00]: put into the black market, which of course
those licenses were never to sell the herb
[SPEAKER_00]: They were only to grow the herb and use
the herb as medicine and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately that very Action that
undermined the entire MMR program and had
[SPEAKER_00]: us, you know Basically have to fight for
our right to grow again while fucking it
[SPEAKER_00]: up for everyone else I don't mind telling
you every single person who had an MMR
[SPEAKER_00]: license and was selling that herb for
profit Shame on you not because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wrong to sell herb for profit I think
that's a great thing to do But don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do it under the guise of a federal
exemptee license that people need and
[SPEAKER_00]: require Just go do it and break the law
the way we used to That's that you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to if you have to make profit off
of cannabis and you can't get a license To
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then obviously what you're doing is
you're selling it illegally and I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: in practicing civil disobedience and I
believe that obviously the compassion
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs need to have their medicine acquired
from somewhere, but I'm just like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a tough point of contention with me
where so many people sold so much of their
[SPEAKER_00]: weed from the MMR that they pulled the MMR
license and then even those same people
[SPEAKER_00]: would always say Well, I hope that they're
gonna grandfather us in and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfather you in shame on you They can't
be grandfathering anyone in this has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: for everyone Everyone has to have the
ability to get this if they want it now
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me most Canadian citizens do not
want to have to grow their own cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for medicine Guaranteed they want to have
access to it just like they have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: their everything else they buy their food
and their clothes and their Alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: their everything we buy for the most part
comes from large companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to support a smaller Craft
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great bubble bags started out as a
small craft company now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a larger company Well, we still love
getting support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be called evil because
we're a corporation I I donate money to
[SPEAKER_00]: the right things I give medical discounts
and Sometimes people lose sight of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that if you can be a corporation you
can be fairly big And you cannot be evil
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how mark Emory's doing up
here in Canada I think he's damn happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: be free from prison and be with his
beautiful wife Jody and have his wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that they that they both have
and He seems to be pretty happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't hang out with him on the
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very rarely see him I did talk briefly
to Jody today about maybe throwing a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpian party at cannabis culture who here
is from Vancouver I'd like to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are all from if you don't mind
just type in where you're where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching from Right now It'd be great to
see if we had a couple of Vancouverites in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room because I do want to get your
idea about a potential Blue River Terpian
[SPEAKER_00]: party I've had medical discounts 25% from
day one of my company day one I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: done that keep in mind where I come from
was I was one of the first growers for the
[SPEAKER_00]: BC Compassion Club I procured cannabis for
the BC Compassion Club at a loss For the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time that I procured I would never
make profit off the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not something I was willing to
do Vernon couple of Vernon's in the house
[SPEAKER_00]: nice Stefan Phillips nice hanging out with
Cushman in Vegas gives give thanks give
[SPEAKER_00]: give shout out give mad hugs to mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman fucking good friend of mine
we got a Eugene and a Florida Langley
[SPEAKER_00]: because BC only in Vancouver though I
would love to make even sponsor an event
[SPEAKER_00]: with flowers for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes sponsoring and sponsoring is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Illinois We got Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Seattle Pendleton Yes, we've heard
Langley BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in for the Terp party, Ohio Mike Combs
is definitely in for the Terp party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Mike Combs yesterday randomly enough
He was getting off work and asked if he
[SPEAKER_00]: could pick up terpenes and I said well
sure I'll come meet you I told him to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: me out in front of Nat's pizza and We
proceeded to have a really quite a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene dip Rip it was how we met was
through Terps I asked him if he wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little session and we went and had
a little session and it was indeed a
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure to meet you Mike you were you
were very easy to hang out with and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: neat meeting someone that you absolutely
don't know maybe less so for you I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know because you might feel that you know
me better than I know you because you
[SPEAKER_00]: watch all these videos and you You've seen
me talk on hash church, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it was definitely trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Kyle chain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday on the 29th there brother
It was it was neat for me to meet someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that I absolutely did not know and then
just have a session And a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about Terps on eBay Jamie
Jamie James Jamie house I would stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue River if I were you obviously I'm
biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust a lot of Folks out there in
the extraction world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all say the same thing their shit is
the cleanest the cleanest the cleanest and
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just can't be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone can have the cleanest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them must be wrong I got my
camera for the very reason to show the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness and the purity of what I have
the ability To accomplish missed out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the third party in Barcelona, dude Adam it
was a good party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a better thing next year
though Honestly, we should we should talk
[SPEAKER_00]: actually because DNA might want to be a
part of that if we could get sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the the dabble product to be like a
strawberry banana or a Tangy or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: kosher Kush get two or three varieties of
you know, some of the shit that's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: down there and Produce like a little Blue
River bubble man brand DNA fucking The
[SPEAKER_00]: party I think the three of us could kill
it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to Don and Erin about that because
they're welcome to be a part of it We're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do it regardless and of course
they're invited But I like the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing their name up there and I like the
idea of the base Material that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing being DNA genetics that would that
would go very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those turps don't lie, bro Those turps do
not lie That's a fact of it Sour tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: sour tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh DNA turp party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Blue River DNA bubble man turp party So
let's let's keep make that sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think the bubble man name
should go in the front What do you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a humble pie guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put my name right at the back No,
I don't think it would be at La Colada
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would up it If I got it to the
point where it was Blue River bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: brand and DNA We would make a point on
getting a really fucking not saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: like La Colada isn't a great venue Those
people are fucking incredible awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so Just really amazing hosts
their resin quality It was just very like
[SPEAKER_00]: the it's an Italian place and they smoke
an enormous amount of cigarettes in there
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not the exact vibe I want
for an updated version of The party
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing against those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd throw a party at their place again for
sure But I think for this particular Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: River party, we would find another venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Need to buy an emailing glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should I buy online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Heath, you know and a lot of people
might flip out for me saying this It
[SPEAKER_00]: really depends on your level now my mentor
for instance Now I never I always
[SPEAKER_00]: supported the most expensive shit
mothership glass for fucking $4,000 D
[SPEAKER_00]: email with the courts for for $900 Or
whatever the 1100 that did the 2.0 I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: always down with getting the best of the
best of the best and that's what I promote
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do realize that some people are not
it's not viable for them to go and spend
[SPEAKER_00]: $6,000 on their email and and pipe so
recently the West Coast concentrate guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: went over to their place and they they
have the DH gate motherships for $30 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: puffed out of them and I was like well
like I have to admit like I'm not gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one but Fuck it sure got me dabbed out
and sure got me bubbled out And I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them if they could order one of
those with an email that was literally
[SPEAKER_00]: like $30 or something for my mentor Ron
Because he's hard on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna break the fucking pipe for sure
eventually So a $30 pipe for him to break
[SPEAKER_00]: is no problem in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has that pipe right now He is loving
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a cheap little electric nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is loving it He paid he paid a hundred
bucks for a glass pipe and two glasses
[SPEAKER_00]: Pipes and an and an email Yeah,
there's brother ships as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are close to a thousand bucks,
you know Hickey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hickey Contact Hickey Ron Hickey got
the exact thing you want if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with Ron call him up and ask him
He's got the DH gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they got him a FTK and maybe a
mini the mini one as well So what is
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone puffing on locked into some og 18
Og speaking og I got the triple og right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more triple og right here.

got a venom og.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my venom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my venom?

more hit shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have one more hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what we're all puffing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it orange crush homegrown
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam really got the room instigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hit the triple og Triple og,
I don't know if you guys noticed this
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie, but I finally figured out that my
happy daddy sword Fits into this tightly
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that I'm confident to use it as a
carb cap and I actually fucking love it So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure I need that other one sent
out anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Really kind of dig this this other vibe
I got going on Didn't taste like og to me
[SPEAKER_00]: what didn't taste like og to you
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Nice that was cool the way that
little symbol showed up on the screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: popped We're gonna send it anyway.

[SPEAKER_00]: And find the carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, yeah, you must have got a bunk batch

sometimes people heat them up and they
[SPEAKER_00]: change the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep them in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't like leave them Out like just
hanging out in room temperature have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun come across them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can really dull them You want to keep
them in a fridge or a freezer?
