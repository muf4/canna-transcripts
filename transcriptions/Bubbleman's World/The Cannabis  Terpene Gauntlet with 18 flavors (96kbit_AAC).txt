[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with D420K and we are about to do
the Blue River Extracts Terpene Gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 18 incredible flavors that I've had
sent over from Mr. Verzura Tony from Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to kind of go through them real
quick, we've got Lemon Kush, we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Creamsicle, we've got Purple Punch,
we've got Sunset KB, we've got Pineapple
[SPEAKER_01]: Creamsicle, or Pineapple Cream,
and then we have Tahoe OG, Triple OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ath Gooey,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue, Vitamin CBD, Cheese Bomb,
Red Congolese, oh my god, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Congo, is that a cross with something?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Green Congo and a Red Congo,
they're separate, they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog, Venom OG, SMW, which is the
Strawberry Mind Warp, and finally but not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, last but not least, we got the
Cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have taken a drop out of each one and
placed it into, oh sorry, I forgot,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Purple Hindu as well, which is the one
here at the end that doesn't actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: the small jar, because I only got large
jars of Purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pulled out a couple of drops and put
it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each empty jar without the label has
maybe a drop or two maximum in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that way we can dip each hit into the
turp jar without actually affecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: original turp jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe contaminating it with your
rosin and my rosin at the same time.
100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terpenes are solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would chew up our rosins,
and that's a good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell everyone what you're
using as your base for today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I've got 120 dry sift OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really thick and it's dark,
but very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice catch, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I brought to smoke as the base
flavor to start with, so I'm not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: any contaminate caught across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both talked about it earlier before
filming that it would be best if we hit
[SPEAKER_01]: each rip with the same product and just go
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using some of the West Coast
concentrate rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is a purple candy pure,
I believe, not with anything else mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm pretty excited, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we start the gauntlet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try and do it in under an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means every minute and 30 seconds,
either Darren or myself has to be taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every three minutes we each have to take
one new rip to get under the one hour
[SPEAKER_01]: mark, so I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll go... Let's go purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited about this little... And
we're also doing just little rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good thing to explain to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not doing what we would normally
hit, 18 of those rips in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really all about the terpenes and
the cannabinoids are mostly in this
[SPEAKER_01]: situation the carrier for the terpenes
because we don't really want to hit pure
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find hitting them with the cannabinoids
to just be the perfect, perfect rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I've known that I've...
This is all... Every one of these strains
[SPEAKER_02]: is terps all from the marijuana strain
that it's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other things involved here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge thing I wanted to point out
because there's all kinds of creamsicle
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that coming out,
but they're not terps from the strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're terp profiles, they're just
created to taste like that and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: actual cannabis terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Mark Scaldone, our PhD chemist in
Hash Church says terpenes are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to be a little disagreeant with
that when it comes to the inhalation of
[SPEAKER_01]: these potentially caustic, potentially
solvent based terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that they're coming
from cannabis, the plant that produces
[SPEAKER_01]: them that we have been inhaling them off
of for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just prefer a cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind we're also smoking a profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not puffing any pure terpenes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pure cannabis terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a variety of terpenes that we're
hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess... We start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very light cheers on the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the nail cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only done it one other time,
but it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also nice to use a base that you're
so used to because you recognize the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say that the temperature makes a
huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are both hitting under 600 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at about 578 to 580 or 577 to 580
and the lower temperature within the turps
[SPEAKER_01]: always seems to make it a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a lighter hit in the sense
you'll get this smoke off on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, but the terpene rip that you
get from that low temp dab, we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: quite as low as some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people go under 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The West Coast boys, one guy likes it
really low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low temp dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say about lemon kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste the citrusy in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of this one now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy smokes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could have one of those sleep apnea
machines at night and have that scent
[SPEAKER_02]: pumped into my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to dab right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very, very modulated off of the first
hit, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an amazing, great feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go and enjoy yourself for an
hour on this vibe, whereas we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, of course, shatter it with
the... The smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lick your lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Hindu was beautiful, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's much more going on in the
lemon kush in its levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are levels going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you notice that the taste on your
lips versus the taste in your mouth versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the taste in your throat, they're all
slightly different the way it fractions
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it's all on my lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to describe, though,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor-wise, it's... I mean, I'm thinking
kind of like that... As silly as it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds, it's a party in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a party in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of fucking turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a party in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I came here with a headache,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two... Traffic, headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two... It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the smell of those turps,
to me, is something that... That does
[SPEAKER_01]: something to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Bubble Man brand that's
dropping right away Super Bowl weekend
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up here at Harborside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out if you're in town in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I find amazing because when you
smell it out here, if you can catch the
[SPEAKER_00]: waft, it's creamy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the dope from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the dope and the hash from
that and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creamy from a distance, yet like
citrusy when you get it close to your
[SPEAKER_01]: nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrusy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes really... When you get up close,
it grabs you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But down over here, it's more like the
cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some really unique flavors,
and I think we're going to get dipping
[SPEAKER_01]: here right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dipping that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting dippy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are just doing little rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not like the gauntlet of Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, where we were taking full-size rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is about really understanding the
subtle nuances of the modulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting destroyed.
Did you dip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not getting destroyed on 18... We know if
we take 18 rips of Rosin or Bubble Hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry Sift that we're going to get... Double
dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more about just understanding the
subtle nuances of the terpenes and those
[SPEAKER_01]: modulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find, and we were talking about the
way THC starts as a buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a real...
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has this thing, and I can't
remember the name skunk man Sam called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a synthate or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends, and that's the burnout or the
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was saying that the terpenes,
they kind of just turn that part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the buzz, and then you just
kind of keep floating on that buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not... Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be a treat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let a little bit of that one out your
nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the tiniest little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make me sneeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do the whole hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let out a little bit, and then I
blew it out my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the flavor in my nose now from letting
that out is just this incredibly orange
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like fucking Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go fucking get an Orange
Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this, with that blow out of the
nose, and I got the turps and the nose
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs and that, it's like... It's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first smelled the Orange
Creamsicle, because obviously I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the brand, the photo of Hatch
posted up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the Orange Creamsicle
Hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to have it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be able to have the terpenes,
these are cannabinoid free terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just terpenes present in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this one now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't add the second word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blaming the kisser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the people at home that aren't getting
the experience, there are multi dimensions
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in these flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you move them away and move them
closer to your nose, you experience those
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of flavor dimensions differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what he just experienced as
he was going in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You catch the spike of these flavors that
are elusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, not so elusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like powering the kisser.
[SPEAKER_02]: In front of you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, let's get dim on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know the buzz too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like... Did we dip this one
already?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I was going to say, jeez,
we're already forgetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so buzzed out from... What have we
done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done three, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just 15 more to go, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, someone's probably going to be
like, did you see Bubble Man's put up the
[SPEAKER_01]: goat head fingers?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely like illuminati.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely devil worshiping.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stoked on turps is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright my good buddy, here's a Purple
Punch to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sparring with my buddy Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a glass of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Purple Punch, it smelled very
strong to me, but its flavor was almost
[SPEAKER_01]: elusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's because I blew
it out my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nostrils, that one was very different
from the Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blowing it out my nostrils was more of
that expected itchy, raspy like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm going to sneeze type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you have to say on the flavors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you catch?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor I caught at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That end flavor on the back of the tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's that strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Punch?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's the strain Purple Punch down
in Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got strains up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody gets strains mixed up and
changes names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This strain reminds me of something that
I've had before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ro said that about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Sunset KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunset KB?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's KB?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colored Bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my label as Sunset KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I let Ro smell this yesterday and
right away he said, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he went, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminds me something from my past.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a subtle one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit, you don't smell it if
you put it too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's one you kind of have to go far
and close, far and close and you'll catch
[SPEAKER_01]: it in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wonder if sniffing these types
of terpenes have any effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely making me
lightheaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like some people would
huff gas or some fucking thing and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some fucked up because of the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an argument about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people that I kind of call
them haters because I don't think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating proper open dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, first of all, we do know that
inhaling terpenes on cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_01]: done for thousands of years for maybe tens
of, you know, 10 to 50 or 60 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been smoking or maybe even
longer concentrates, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the next level, not just hash,
but like oils and concentrates made into,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the terpenes are very high in some
of these concentrates, very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, almost as high as and higher
sometimes than the flavors that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, hashes that have been tested with
added terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tony added terpenes to one of his
rosins, I think at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a product that had a
higher terpene content than his and they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't add terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are used to inhaling these terpenes
at a fairly high dose, at least for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 10 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we do know that
terpenes can act as solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can break down plastics and that
there probably is going to be a level of
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of huffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'd like to think that we're much more
like, you know, inhaling on a level of
[SPEAKER_01]: like aromatherapy where you pass around a
bunch of aromas and people would,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't get enjoyment from doing
that from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, it's a subtle thing that I like
about these terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would definitely be a nice aroma to
have throughout the house all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just subtly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you needed is subtly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel after five terp mod hits
though?
Baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel, I feel like close to as baked as I
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet I know when I hit this, I'm going to
be more elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about the term bake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work against us to use these terms
in the recreational, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is it a negative word?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, even that one seems like a
sham and that we're hiding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one seems phony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're hiding behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the term is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you guys can come up with some great
comments at this point because it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: something positive that doesn't have the
negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, yeah, you know, like
inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pothead fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The negative.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go smoke another joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sunset KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that was like loud, like citrus,
but not really citrusy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost changing more in the back
of my throat where I'm getting a fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fruit basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not citrusy, but it's loud like lemon
or lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana, strawberry, and some fucking,
and some lime to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunset KB is definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got pineapple cream and we got OG Tahoe
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one goes right on the other side of
this one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them attached to their dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're touching each dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pineapple cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you just put that one down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put this one back sunset KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I pulled up the next one,
which is pineapple cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow I'm staying on the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, these are micro hits too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely not hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show a camera shot of like the size
of the hits that we're hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just little, little, you know,
maybe match heads of, of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even a match head, full match head,
maybe half a one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get through these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got to get through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say like, I feel right now
off of these five or six, whatever we've
[SPEAKER_01]: hit now, small reps, a better quality,
whatever you want to call this once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: high, if you will, with none of the
negative connotations, a better quality
[SPEAKER_01]: high as achieved, especially with the
different terpenes and all the modulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, this is for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could literally use just one terpene a
day and, and feel the effects of morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: noon and night and how the modulation
changes that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just a good old fun thing to
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something you guys can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find yourselves, blueriverextracts.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally go on there and you can
order many of these strains, if not all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in the U S I know that blue
river is going to be opening up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually I'm trying to help out with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be at blueriverextracts.ca.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, you know, people will be
able to get to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different people making
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody needs these in their
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not, that is, you know,
we love to recreationally smoke this and
[SPEAKER_02]: always have, but the medical benefits,
everything about it makes it such a bonus,
[SPEAKER_02]: such a bonus that what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden there's something
else that makes it medically better as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beyond a bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: After being the black sheep of the family,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For all of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to be like, Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can, you can help me with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is something that can help
grandma and like uncle Bob and everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Auntie Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, I was kicked out of my
home at 14 for a couple of joints that
[SPEAKER_02]: fell out of my stock sock on the stairs by
my dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad takes my coconut oil and eats it
daily because it helps with his IBS and he
[SPEAKER_02]: loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's proud of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't give up hope when truth is
on your side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, people always say,
Oh, you know, like you're such a good
[SPEAKER_01]: debater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's no debate when it comes
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're in the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not fucking going to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth is on its side and it's,
uh, you know, it's brought us here today
[SPEAKER_01]: for the turptips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pineapple cream across the old
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that second hit was definitely
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just make a pineapple cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pineapple whipped cream on this dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy's wife makes the first hit I hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blew out and I thought it was going to
have a really strong taste because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously the first hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had very little taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I carb capped it and hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, that was a world of difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does taste almost like a, like a
pineapple coconut or a pineapple cream
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, a pineapple dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a sorbet or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste a bit of coconut in there though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pineapple coconut trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a pina colada, except not like a
pina colada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pineapple coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe OG is not going to get things any
lighter for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, this one's, this one's
heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it right in my eyes,
behind my eyes, top of the high lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only got 12 left.
[SPEAKER_02]: There.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, did you see that video of
those fucking yahoos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, when we did the,
the, um, dry sift gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of the videos ever are always
starting off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very, you know, aware and boom,
you know, we're right on point and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the end of the videos,
we are, everybody says, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, there's, there's, there's times
where it says D420K is off somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sitting literally down there like
this, just, yeah, just staring somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: for about 30 seconds and then come to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made it, we've made it through one
row of three rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually at the end of the first
row.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the first row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you dip it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck did I dip it, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't dip the Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's why I put it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you did dip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I accept your apology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a little excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I accept your apology.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little excited here in the, uh,
in the turp lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the turp lounge, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Tahoe cut and the forum cut,
whatever the cookies, it's, it's deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, that is a deep Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, yeah, it's crossed my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossed my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only twice that I've drank my
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to mark all these funny
things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, did you notice they,
uh, they drank their water after the
[SPEAKER_01]: so-and-so and the Tahoe and the Tahoe was
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might've been the pineapple one
that I, or no, the one that I took a drink
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked you going no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, listen to this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even get the thought out of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, he's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we should start over with
OG again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go, uh, let's go blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dream it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dream it up.
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, this one literally got like a
drop put in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have to, uh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's more there than you think
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue dream classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me at right away, the first
thing I smell in it is the commercialness
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dissing on blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's great herb that a lot of people
can grow and get yields on and make a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: looking product, you know, kind of like a
triple A or whatever they call it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quads yet it's, it's got that commercial
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: To it though, that like the sugar bear,
the Jamaican, the, you know, all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: juicy fruit, all the commercial ones we
had, you nailed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those you smell it there, but now try to
get past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about my telephone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and get into the actual past the
commercial flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, there's a nice profile to be had in
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do enjoy the thing that I liked about
the juicy fruit was it was the very start
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the first couple joints out of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it was just wore off,
but the flavor of it and the taste was
[SPEAKER_02]: just something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to unplug it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it, if it lights up again, we'll go
unplug it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm dipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells even nicer on the dip rather
than from the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a more open air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another thing about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so different in, if you change
their environment, smelling them in an
[SPEAKER_01]: enclosed jar is very different from taking
a drop of them and placing it on a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: dish in open air.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, buddy dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely had a lot of the juicy fruit
Jamaican sugar bear flavor, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something else there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's just so pronounced to me,
it's, it's, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nowhere near as powerful as some of
the ones we tried already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the last one, it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a more subtle, subtle, but it's,
it's flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets, it wouldn't be something I get
tired of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would if I was smoking the juicy
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had the Terps, I'd be dipping double
dip and triple dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red Congolese, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wait, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit this one eight times in a row
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it once and then it was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think it might be my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: A favorite out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the only one I hit eight times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it eight times in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I just, even today I was
hitting it on the Skype with skunk man Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had his collection out and he was
like, which one should I try?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh, pull out the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he hits it and he's like,
Oh, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Oh, well tell me what other
ones I should hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, right off the bat,
hit another red Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass her over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dipped you again without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I did dip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, uh, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did not dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start marking that stuff down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny when you just get a little bit
like completely destroyed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit completely destroyed and
we are more than completely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Congo, terpene, gauntlet number one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if six turned out to be none?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimi Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was everything I love about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Landrace, spicy, exotic, perfumey,
uh, uh, uplifting, uh, vivid, loud,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm speechless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, holy shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's a giddy high.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, cause we're uplifting
and, uh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, as crazy as it sounds in
the middle of the gauntlet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another nine to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm literally considering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking another hit of the red Congo before
I move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: God hates a coward.
[SPEAKER_01]: God hates a coward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's follow it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's follow it up with one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go through the whole gauntlet,
but then we finish it with red Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the red Congo or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there's one we find that we finish
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the purple punch?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the red Congo more
personally, but you can finish it with
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that purple punch really stuck in my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not maybe the one that you're
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's going to be cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a similarity of a few
terpenes in every batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can pick that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think to the subtle nose,
the person that doesn't have the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: of a very strong olfactory, they might say
something like these kind of all smell the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, even though there are really quite
vast differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are minor similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be like, oh, I smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right away it's like,
like smell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like similar to what we've smelled
and yet nothing like anything we've
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catching that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard cause it's a profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of them like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I haven't hit the cheese
bomb yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few I haven't hit yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really the first person I've hit
all of these flavors with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it to you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I got to be quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's me, not you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting all philosophical.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fucking very endocannabinoid
saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are endocannabinoid saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most terpenes I've been in my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting turped up here on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just glad that you guys are
joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that have your Blue River
terpenes with you, we're about to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheese bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, not funky cheese at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: More like cheesecake bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out just, I don't know, that was a
really pleasant taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really fucking, there wasn't a
punch like those two that really kicked
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a punch, but it was definitely
not super subtle either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can taste it in my mouth, fairly strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can taste it on my lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, each time we hit
one, these are so pronounced, you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: it with essential oils, it is very
different each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've tried those terpenes that are
done from a whole bunch of other terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and made into a profile, not from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're mixed with the clear or put on
some rosin or whatever, dipped or dropped
[SPEAKER_02]: onto some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm just trying to be faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, I know, but I was just like,
take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're hitting a rip every minute
and a half to three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about laughing,
being giddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that one we did with the speed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got speed tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought my manager didn't pay it,
I was worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay mine yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We paid ours twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They paid us back the once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so intense about him paying it,
he paid it twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he got the check back in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hadn't mentioned that yet, had I?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the vitamin CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an award winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez, I think Tony and I, we took first at
the Emerald Cup with the vitamin CBD rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: sap that he busted out onto the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I've got an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn my nail down just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go down a little bit more,
like maybe say, let's say 540.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to push the square button once
and then just go down to 540 and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has a similarity to the, what was the one
that tasted similar to the, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the vitamin CBD to have a little
bit of a Blue Dream-esque flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever that terpene profile is that we
spoke about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, vitamin CBD it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is a CBD strain obviously,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a misnomer because obviously
I don't know why they choose to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD over anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not got anything to do with CBDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it has everything to do with CBD and
the fact that it's a high CBD profile
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is probably the highest percentage
of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it might be a ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be 21 or 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know, but I'm sure someone will
know and they can post it in the comment
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anything change because of the CBD or
the THC in the terpens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always thought that they would
probably find that the terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously it's the modulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be very surprised if it didn't
modulate CBD effects, that terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles that are specific to high CBD
strains should be as much paid attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to as the percentage of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're really high and you smoke a
CBD, isn't it supposed to level you out,
[SPEAKER_02]: calm you down, get you a little,
like take it away?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were hitting high amounts of the
cannabinoid and cannabinoid, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the terpenes modulated without the
CBD present, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with that last talk, literally,
I'm not stoned anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your bioassay says this, is it joking?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are baked right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hitting the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is real nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard so much of this, about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, glue is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue is like boom pow,
schnapps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene really, really represents the
flowers accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that grows gorilla glue or knows
gorilla glue very well as a smoker or an
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado of hashish or concentrates,
they are going to fucking recognize this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to kaboom pow pow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine as you are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might need another CBD hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice glue hit at 539.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it tastes just like the full
melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes exactly like gorilla glue full
melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me like picture caramel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, full melt gorilla glue in my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to fucking find out flavor,
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, have a couple of smells while
you're, another nice thing is to hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you're, you're tasting it,
smell it while you're tasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pick up, uh, different nuances
that you might not be able to pick up on
[SPEAKER_01]: your nose alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like, like just fucking in
your nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That CBD one gave me a very lemony taste
without the citrus, without the citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very soft lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people call it a cherry taste,
but there is a fruity taste that I also
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up on a different CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely that one is, is, is also
something quite, quite pick off the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I'm excited for this though.
[SPEAKER_01]: What number are we at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like maybe 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one might be my favorite just now
smelling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you haven't tried this one yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to tell you, just smell
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a fence of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pink as soon as I smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is aff gooey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think very nice soft pink color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Badger turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to say, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're having fun here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make the video somewhat
serious, but come on, we're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: gauntlet of 18 rips and we're 12 in.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can anybody be serious after 12 rips
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you just say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's even scarier is we are actually 12
rips in accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been keeping count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me another taste of that before you
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the smell of that one has been just.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me, it reminds me of really
nice flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you even explain that to someone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a whole bouquet of the best smelling
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but cannabis flowers, like they're,
you're right though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a florally like beautiful other
like bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an interesting thing that
Darren's doing here is with the smelling,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of trying to break it down with,
with words, there are pictures that are
[SPEAKER_01]: appear in your head when you smell some of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get it at first, but when he
said the flowers and then I said cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, right at the end of that,
I picked up a hint of what you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those actual, no, like flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't talking badge turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking actually the color pink,
soft pink is what I seen for smelling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is that nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way you just said that so
seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't actually talking about bad
turps on the discussion of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's dip, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three minute mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't we in between dips?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one might be the longest time we've
waited yet, but come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 12 in and there's a, we're no
slouches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the good work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go backwards and do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If maybe we're doing the good work of the
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So love to learn about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a couple of Google searches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can join my Facebook group called all
things terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see more discussion there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we're looking for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't claim to know a lot about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not telling you that what we're even
doing right now is safe and should be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor are we condoning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do it, you're a big boy or
a big girl, by all means try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the science in the next five to
10 years will be very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the bioassay, I have to admit,
like just the way it makes me feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel happy and I don't feel wasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel giddy, like I'm jokey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long since we had a turp rip.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting that florally aftertaste really
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lavendery, definitely pinkish and purpley
blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: In every one of these toks, when you
exhale it and then you stop and sit back,
[SPEAKER_02]: you feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one is a different little
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a little bit of a,
just put us over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just half gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really set a nice tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready to get heavy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple OG, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might want to take a bit of a bigger dab
for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit bigger than I was
going to go, but still going quite small
[SPEAKER_01]: by anyone's standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: By no means are we trying to claim that
we're taking monster rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just doing an 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do those monster rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can, but they hurt me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do a monster rip like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're setting the tone for the video and
the next guy to get 18 types of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a half gram rip with each turp,
a couple of drops and do the nine gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an idea that I'll throw out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you dipped?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dipped, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you dip before you throw your ideas
out at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: These young guys, on the channel,
love to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met them at this place on, well,
at the Smoker's Lounge there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was saying, you know how they got those
videos of a bud coated in some shatter and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dipped in keif.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's buds that are dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we do buds with rosin,
with water hash, dry sift and coat the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked me, maybe we should put a video
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show the world, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your solventless moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just told the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys better be on it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get fast, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are, I know they watch too,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those OGs are just, they've got this
extremely earthy and deep, deep,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how to like explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice subtle differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can pick up in the ends too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially now that we've turned the nail
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one, that one closes the
eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close your eyes on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it super, super deep inhalation and
tell me that's not like chocolate or
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get deep on that without fucking
it biting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I guess we better step this shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you really need in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an eye closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an eye closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to give them the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: This chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unadulterated, never touched chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's speed this shit up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done like 63 and we have 17 left
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how that works out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it.
Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 14 rips in math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 67 and 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave this open so we can
smell it while we exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or as we cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so chem-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog-age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the good word on this chem dog that it
was very, very legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came from an incredible grower that had
helped show other friends of ours in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a guy knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That chem dog is... Just... Yeah,
that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had me coughing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my God, that's the first time
we've had a scene in edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coughing like a maniac.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready for some venom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: G?
[SPEAKER_01]: Venom-oach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oach-cooch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cooch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of that cooch going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that... You like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that reminds me of your
oach.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes me, no, that takes me back to
the fucking days where these brothers,
[SPEAKER_02]: these older boys taught me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, I was so happy with going in,
cutting clones, trimming weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: selling the shit for fucking, getting it
for $2.75 a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going out and straight up all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was happy at all of it, doing it for
fuck all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was fresh, brand new into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you something... What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The strawberry strain, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, no, no, keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strawberry strain that they had wasn't
a very good yielder at all, but the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: of it was something phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is exactly that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me, what are these terps for if
you're just not dipping them, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not putting them into food products,
if you're not putting them...
[SPEAKER_01]: The olfactory memory triggers that these
things cause, I've seen many people,
[SPEAKER_01]: since I've shown them, have memory
triggers from their past and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow man, that totally brings me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally brings me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the days when I first got,
was able to be a part of doing something
[SPEAKER_02]: with a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those guys fucking worked the hell out
of me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well here's to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking right, thanks boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, an interesting thing I find
out about the terps is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you want to keep having a
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't kind of taper off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just keeps going through this
beautiful, just soaring... This could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm talking, forget about vapor
lounges and bars with alcohol and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the terp bar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the terp experience where you go to
dinners, you gather with people,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice glasses brought to you, brought to
the table at the end of your food,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even in between your dessert and
your food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a terp platter that comes
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You choose your terps that you guys all
want to try and then you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful experience where just taking
micro doses and getting iry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A terp dose with your hash in between
courses to eat, just like matching wine
[SPEAKER_02]: with food and all that kind of stuff would
be something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could eat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, I'm not so totally stoned
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I couldn't eat a nice meal right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also this pretty extreme to go
through 18 flavors each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody else done it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure someone's done it
somewhere, but I've never seen anyone do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who could answer that question
accurately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people out there in the world,
but I bet you it's the first time you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have seen it before, post the link
in the comment section because we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: give those guys a high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, what are we 14 in,
15 in, 16 in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two left.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I plan that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably did, but subconsciously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry AK-47 and strawberry mind warp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it in order and go for the
strawberry mind warp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I guess the next sort of levels
of this stuff, these turp parties is
[SPEAKER_02]: taking, is, is matching turps with other
turps and mixing and seeing what that
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome is, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't wipe your dabber with your
dabber rag here, you could end up kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: each time producing a little bit of a
Jeffrey effect and picking up effects from
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, you know, I'm sure we've had a
little bit of that happen by no means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wiping my dabber on this little
guy, but not every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 18 different bowls, brand new
bowls, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fucking true test.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's do it next time like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe get a couple of more people in
here because we've shown that we can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a fairly short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the timeline is,
but I know we're definitely not two hours
[SPEAKER_01]: into a video right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go check out D420K on Vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm BC Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got these just ridiculous vines that
I think they could go viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triple dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you dipped?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are hitting the strawberry mind warp
17th rip turp modulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruity flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It overpowered my bong and my nail and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell your carb cap, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: My carb cap smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a smell while you're tasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that that is definitely the double
dose of really ... Everyone has a
[SPEAKER_01]: different olfactory sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about that pipe last at
the hash church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you'd have the double bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you'd get the vaporizer and then the
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hash rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was turpene modulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lightly vaping off the turps and
some cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using hash in a separate bowl,
this pipe melted together only at the top
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthpiece where the two vapors collided
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful thing, but this is some
next level shit that we're onto right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually on number 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on number 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: We motored through these, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost willing to go through them
backwards now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make a short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want it to be two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: 36, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it's under the hour limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of hope so anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give that a little wipe ski and go
fresh for my last hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this isn't my last hit because
I'm definitely finishing it with a big
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking rip of Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm taking a pretty big rip with this
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to fucking ... Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just go a little bigger for the last
one or second last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been ... I think I want to take a
rip of some of that rosin you got over
[SPEAKER_02]: there or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always welcome on my staff,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's number 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 18, Strawberry Mind Warp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, Tony Verzura, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for this experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are doing amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super happy to help represent Blue River
up here in Canada and be a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United Cannabis team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie and Tony and the good people at
Harborside, Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
All
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The low temp dabs are so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like
[SPEAKER_02]: ...
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell that when you got that threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy schnapples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, if it did land on that
being the last one, I wouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_01]: upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I would not have been upset
about any of them being the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not one thing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain is telling me the Juicy Fruit
imitation was the only one ... That maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't belong on the pedestal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wouldn't say didn't belong,
but I would say would be the one that ...
[SPEAKER_02]: That I liked the least out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not ... Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick it out of bed from the trackers type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I ran out of Blue Dream last
time, I was bummed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out of 18 kinds, something has to be
at the end of the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something that your mind
speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it did to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do this up properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finish our video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit my butter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Butter Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hitting the Shadow Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the Shadow Rosin for every one of
those rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to just do a Butter Rosin
for my last Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it inspires you guys to do a
similar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun with your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get together with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be understanding that we're still
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge anyone that has an interest in
chemistry, you know, phyto-cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are incredible things to study right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: PhDs could be written on
phyto-cannabinoids and terpene profiles of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's you guys that are going to teach
us all the important things that we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to know to use these as safe modulators in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give thanks everyone for watching
