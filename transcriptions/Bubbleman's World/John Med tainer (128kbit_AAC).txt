[SPEAKER_01]: John from Medtainer, tell us how your
cup's been, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had an amazing time, especially
with you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been having... The hash was
amazing!
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little squink and it's people
in the world that know their stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: cough hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got lots of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great bunch of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 26th annual Hot Times was by far my
best and my second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, hey, I've watched them all on TV and
have for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody around here loves this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and how's it been for Medtainer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been telling people a lot about
Medtainers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medtainer, Medtainer, everybody has one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show us, show us, show us what they're
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airtight, watertight storage container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely submersible in a water storage
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% airtight, watertight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong enough to do coffee grinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best part about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour the coffee in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few beans like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grind it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pour that right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already pre-ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a beautiful product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airtight, watertight, submersible in the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing about this Medtainer is
this air seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got no wearable parts, no movable
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quality five medical grade plastic
for storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your mom's tupperware or should
I say your grandma's tupperware that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oblong teeth, very unique design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: No wearable parts, no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, you don't get any metal
shavings in your weed or little pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic with the other grinders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of sense of resplendent water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine on the go, the green way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medtainer, advancing forward with cannabis
medicine on the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where can people that aren't at the
Cannabis Cup check out Medtainer?
