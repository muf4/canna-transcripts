[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, PawTV viewers?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the bubble man here, live in
Negril, Jamaica, hanging out at the new
[SPEAKER_04]: Royal Itel kitchen that is actually yet to
be opened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the juice bar back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're hanging out with Buffalo and
Red, a Rastafarian elder who's lived in
[SPEAKER_04]: Negril for, jeez, as long as he can
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let him tell you how long it's been,
but he's going to be making a Jamaican
[SPEAKER_04]: steam pipe for us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're doing is we're trying to get to
the roots origin of the vaporizer pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaporizers are quite popular these days
amongst medical users, but also gaining
[SPEAKER_04]: popularity with recreational users as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the most efficient vaporizers
are hot air delivery systems that blow hot
[SPEAKER_04]: air over the cannabis, vaporizing the
resins, allowing you to inhale them as a
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor rather than a smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as far as I'm concerned, I've yet to
find a more original vaporizer than the
[SPEAKER_04]: steam pipe in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the history goes, I heard that a friend
of the Skunk Man's came here in the 70s
[SPEAKER_04]: and was turned on, possibly even by Red,
to the Jamaican steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went back home to California to try
and sort of figure things out and see if
[SPEAKER_04]: he could make his own version with the
help of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Skunk Man offered him the idea of
using a heat gun, and thus the vaporizer
[SPEAKER_04]: heat gun idea was born.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many ideas have sort of branched
off from that idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, wouldn't it be a great idea if
we could show the viewers at PotTV the
[SPEAKER_04]: original vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna introduce you to Red here,
who's hard at work already, and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: making the steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good, doing good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hey to everyone at PotTV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands of people from all over the
world who have access to a computer will
[SPEAKER_04]: be watching this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are now doing one of the steam
pipes, as my good friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba Man, says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm doing, I'm making a clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: This clip is like a, we use this for
taking out the fire, the hot cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put the bamboo together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buffalo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to work with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the end of this, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on and get yourself in the picture
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm making the clip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do now is to get this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little natural clip for picking up the
coals, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, we're in full construction
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're leveling the ground as we speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hot's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it cold, but cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It don't get cold, it get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say fire cold, but it's really not
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fire hot.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire lick ya.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red, red hot, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to hit the chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from cool liquid, the glass blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He blew this chalice, hoping that someone
very much like yourself would get to take
[SPEAKER_04]: a lick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to bless the fire before we hit
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give thanks in place for the hands that
provide the earth or the ash that we use
[SPEAKER_02]: in this fire, and that we will continually
be prosperous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks, Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks.
Bless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any hole?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice bubbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full power.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll grab a little hit myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fill it up for you, my man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready for another.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hole is silly, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for a left handed person.
Bubbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't want to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try this side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing the bubble right before the steam.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_04]: The steam piping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are making the main bowl now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said this
[SPEAKER_04]: is the male piece?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bowl, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the connects the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the steamer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The steamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a common dish of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: One joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going to make a hole in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right through here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I noticed the hole on the bottom was
all the way through, but not the top.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice strong blade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a good blade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when's the first time you yourself saw
a Jamaican Steampie bread?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw a Steampie.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw a Steampie was 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1974, 1975.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of yours showed it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they have original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was original Rasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta camp used to be in Harborview,
in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I got the idea from,
of the steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was making them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Elder Rastas used to use the steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the average people on the street
did not know about steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, even still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even most of the young Rastas and
otherwise didn't know of steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but the Elder Rastas knew of steam
pipes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they used to use their steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had known of the Elder Rastas
because of the other pipe that we called
[SPEAKER_02]: the chiller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did not know about the steam pipe
until about 1975, between 74 to 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got the friend of mine on the Rasta
by the name of Fat Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He taught me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who taught you how?
[SPEAKER_02]: He taught me about the steam pipe,
how to make it, how to smoke,
[SPEAKER_04]: and how to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting to find out from
some of these people that you learnt it
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they, where they themselves learnt it
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it was developed here in Jamaica
or whether it was... No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen photographs of steam pipes in
magazines, African magazines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen steam pipes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen ash pipes, several tubes around
where they have steam pipes that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are five or six tubes that you can
draw from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an African thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in Africa, they really don't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I would have guessed it was
from India or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an Indian African thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever it is, it's a beautiful
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really in a sense, it's harm
reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reduces smoke but steam.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this part that you're making here is...
It's the main part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom part of this consumes water.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which that's where we put the stem in from
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is great for me because I
really have to say I've never seen an
[SPEAKER_04]: original style bamboo Jamaican steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly rasters that know about these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average people doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the younger rasters don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one in Negril that showed you my
Negrils and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make steam pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting closer down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your family's been here in Negril for
quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole that land, my parents' land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even where you are over on the other side,
my parents sold that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We own the whole thing of the virtual
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were saying when the hippies came
in the late 60s and the early 70s,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was here in Negril that was the first
and only place in Jamaica at the time to
[SPEAKER_04]: welcome them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when the hippies start coming
here, you know, it's like most of them
[SPEAKER_02]: landed like, if they had even landed in
Kingston, there was some vibration that
[SPEAKER_02]: draw them to Negril.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was a small fishing village at the
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a small fishing village.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were young rasters at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing about it, there wasn't so
much other people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means when they came here,
we were the first ones that they met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were very honest and start throwing
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to be cooking item food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were interested in learning how to
do it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and those days the hippie had us
to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had us to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the cops because they'll be here at
overstay and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: To help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: To help them hide from the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the mountains and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them ran out of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rasters were very generous more in
those days, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we cook and we... Or maybe they were
just back in those days they were less
[SPEAKER_04]: divisions and less wolves in sheep's
clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no wolves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very small group of rasters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Real rasters, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no wolves at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cutting a little hole in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's to receive the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a way to do it because you don't
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do it properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at watching you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see the way the bamboo splits
lengthwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want it to split too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have it on an angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it apparently seems like... Do you
want me to find you a stick or something
[SPEAKER_04]: to stick in there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've made a few of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you, Rad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once a guy let us make about six hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He stole all the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to put this one to good
use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said we'll put this to good use.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get it fired up and we'll stick a
few sticks of ganja in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And away we'll go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It
[SPEAKER_02]: widdles down nice, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing a nice even job.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one should fit right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a slant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't cut it down that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it that slant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we could get it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it could go down in the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, if you don't get it down into the
water, you're not going to get any water
[SPEAKER_02]: filter.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you see here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to cut it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have it opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you bubble, when you draw,
it doesn't go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bubbles around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put it there, you're going to pull
all the water out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A simple little procedure is quite
important.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will go on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should do this first to fit that,
okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're working on the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to work on the bowl,
okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're working on that bowl over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll work on this bowl over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I need a little help from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get this bowl over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need me over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: One more for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need me over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making that piece nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want that pulled over?
A block.
[SPEAKER_04]: A block?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be smooth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Randy!
[SPEAKER_04]: It still hears music.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is this piece you're working on
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: The bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which baby?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which baby?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never see that grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hold that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that little one?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dead, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dead, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Years ago, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know him dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know him people dead, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it really smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you're using the bowl sometimes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it isn't made from real tough
bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes when you use the fire on top
of the bowl, it eventually burns and
[SPEAKER_02]: crystallizes and has some of the holes in
it and doesn't draw good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the pan is on top and air is
getting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you take it off and you rub it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smooth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smooth it up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the stone is your friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bamboo to stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the draw is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam gets you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because steam is the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unadulterated with no contaminants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the purity.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bubbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone done that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice thick blade, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the thin blades, they cut you
worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice hook.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a gift years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten years ago now.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fitting the downstem into the tube.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock, knock, knock.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't know, you don't know,
you don't know What other clock just took
[SPEAKER_12]: a-chatting, you a-chatting A-chatting,
chatting, chatting
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been too fat, you've been too fat
You've been too fat, for too long They
[SPEAKER_09]: won't back off, can't get to do it,
can't get to do it They're like the ones
[SPEAKER_09]: that guys are outside And knock,
and knock, and knock, and knock,
[SPEAKER_09]: knock, knock, knock, knock, knock it had
to do And they won't stop, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: no They won't Making it fit tight They're
like the
[SPEAKER_08]: ones that
[SPEAKER_12]: guys are outside And they won't back off,
can't get to do it, can't get to do it
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like the ones that guys are
outside And they won't back off,
[SPEAKER_11]: can't get to do it, can't get to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just smoothing out the bowl piece
Nice and smooth Soon we're gonna get a pan
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you wanna be on PotTV?
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright
[SPEAKER_04]: I love days like this But the candle?
[SPEAKER_02]: The candle, I've got the candle Now,
I'm making the holes in the pan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes To put them in the bowl?
[SPEAKER_02]: To put them there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to watch this Yes,
and the circumference so you don't go over
[SPEAKER_04]: the holes You are overstanding now Right,
you used to understand But now I overstand
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go take
[SPEAKER_02]: a shower and change clothes to my uniform
How much is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three
[SPEAKER_04]: raita It's actually four pieces?
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three, four Right, and the clip,
six
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright So we're gonna get the candle
and see these Yes, I did get the candle I
[SPEAKER_04]: brought you a candle Let's go get it here
now So explain to the people what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing I'm trying to see it properly so we
can put a tissue there Putting what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a tissue, I see A little tissue so we
can hold it against the candle and the
[SPEAKER_02]: bamboo Okay?
Yes
Light?
[SPEAKER_11]: Fire!
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a light One of those guys have
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow it up That's why they call them
elders Because they're no stars
[SPEAKER_10]: The wax just making it airtight Talk at
you later Sure
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it wax on you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no What was it saying?
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's gentlemen
[SPEAKER_11]: What was
[SPEAKER_13]: it saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's gentlemen Hold on, hold on,
hold on The days are long
[SPEAKER_10]: When nothing comes along The days are long
When nothing comes along Have patience and
[SPEAKER_10]: hold on
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a lot just to make sure, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're gonna build a little fire To
heat up the pan so it's clean Fire clean
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire burn
[SPEAKER_04]: See how easy it is to start a fire?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pan sits on top to get fired
[SPEAKER_04]: Got his clips
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so any worry of any chemical
residue would be long gone from being
[SPEAKER_02]: fired But it's out You could still use
coals from wood Maybe cedar or birch or
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the woods Birch is not good,
it's a thin wood Any hard wood you could
[SPEAKER_02]: make it from You got those coals there,
you make coals Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely Just coals I like the ITAL way
though Absolutely Some water in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it chubblin
[SPEAKER_04]: Little bit of leak or no?
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels good Yeah, it's bubbling up nice
You're filming this?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting the coal in the pan Ah,
coals in the pan, of course I'm filming it
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, man I bet
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do nothing all you have
to do is hold the camera This lean bubble,
[SPEAKER_07]: this one straight Put it straight There
you are right now And that's Bubbleman and
[SPEAKER_07]: Reds there Smoking the steam pipe Not
smoking, steaming, steaming, steam pipe
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke is when the fire catches the herb
But this one, the fire doesn't touch the
[SPEAKER_07]: herb The fire goes on top in the pan And
the herb is in the coche And he steams
[SPEAKER_07]: This is hot And you can see we got the
purple pineapple skunk there That's what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going in the fire Smells very fruity
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have Dougie around here and Dougie
is going to come and get the heat off the
[SPEAKER_07]: steam pipe That pipe there, tough Normal,
you put it down He's going to put it down
[SPEAKER_07]: on the bamboo Watch what's happening Yeah,
he's just going to sit it
