[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Vova Mounds World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here on the beach of Negril,
the 7 Mile Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the high end beach for the 12th
annual Stepping High Ganja Festival that's
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Negril.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year it's ever been
operating under a permit to have ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to be on site, so there should
be a fair amount of ganja in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself and Tony are executive judges,
so we're going to get to see all the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors, film them all, hopefully
photograph them with the macro and let you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys know what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're just going to head in right
now, so let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Maurice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, how's that for the intro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maurice in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so it's time to go in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entrance is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pay for the tickets to go
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go find out how much they
are.
Hello,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're on the executive judges list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man plus three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Executive judges list.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Bobby told me to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's five of us, but it was me
plus three that Bobby said he would put on
[SPEAKER_02]: the guest list.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked, stepping high.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're putting this on Bubble Man's
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be 10,000 people watching this in
the next two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to put that on right away or
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right next to the maroons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we in, are we in, are we in?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just people in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if I should keep waiting
behind you or if you were just... No,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just chit-chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chit-chatting's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we pay for the other two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we have to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: The police are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Gail Zucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I follow you on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Marcus Richardson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see your photos all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured I should say hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Tony and Kelly and Vivian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you.
Yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he never could come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy to hang out and wait,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hungry food.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's got the best food, dude,
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's going on over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are looking at the Quanta camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Papa Man, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, from last time in Pegasus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pegasus, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how come you didn't come down for the
conference?
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed that conference, but I came about
four days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bunch of meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I was... You okay, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be here right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walk in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walk in the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with Bena and Sue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sue and Bena at their wonderful little
table with ganja cakes and coconut jelly
[SPEAKER_02]: and different sort of shakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been kind enough to let us dab
at their table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Tony over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, these guys are doing their own
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back to dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with that.
You got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a dab, Tony?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kittis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab him with it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait for it to cool down a little bit so
it's more like a steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it's good now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would floor a lot of men.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gotta be good right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good one.
You better get out of here.
You better get out of here.
You better get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You better get out of here.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony!
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a mega move out of me meeting America
about 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you do that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heat up the quartz because it's clean
every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits like a steam pipe because the oil
is so pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was made with water and hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on the table there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that hash is like breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble hash rippage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to really tell anyone it's
pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can know by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When your friend has to say, no,
no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, man, that's salesmanship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just give someone this and don't say
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, this is the purest gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamaica could grow some of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is made in America by bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more steaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the water won't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll smell more good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we got good ganja cake here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got jelly coconuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we tell you we were going to get
business going, girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man,
[SPEAKER_02]: trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know there's other people who
are more suffering, but that one got to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had migraine headaches for two years and
I had to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mine too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got headaches all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, let me get this out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get pictures of shit like
that, you should come by our place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're at Beach Comers, right by the
pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday I'm in Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I've been filming this whole
time, Tony, while doing the torching?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good close-up picture if you can
get a portrait of just the flame in the
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tony's getting the wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first we light it up to burn
anything that's residual, leftover from
[SPEAKER_02]: the last hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get a perfect vapor hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to do the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a glass jar for carving it to
make it restricted, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the hole in the chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another hit for someone, Tones?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're rocking and rolling here,
so I just wanted to get her booth a little
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do this to all the booths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, that's why we keep reminding everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got good ganja cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ganja cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much a slice for the ganja cake?
[SPEAKER_02]: 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good for how strong it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good price, three bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get it that far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't hit hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes like a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, that wasn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like breathing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can't breathe.
What kind of oil is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Ital.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No coconut water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just made with water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're welcome to have one if you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to light this up, Tone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you want your bag safe so you don't
have to think about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'll literally put my foot on it
like I have mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 865-333-7?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was Ashley Davidson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll give you my number right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a local number.
[SPEAKER_02]: 865.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, our friend bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an older fellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: In his 60s now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam the Skunk Man, they call him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also bred Skunk Number One.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it stay in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to hit these French guys
behind me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, don't dab up the French guys behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real Korean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dab will do you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, look at what her shirt says.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use your hand as well if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, this is a legendary drum master.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta hook him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we go on and watch that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tony's just given Bongo Herman a little
bit of coconut oil extract to rub on his
[SPEAKER_02]: skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plant-fused.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no alcohol, no hypoallergenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just sucking up Bongo Herman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub it all over your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub it all over your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want something that tastes like
tangerine or something that tastes like
[SPEAKER_03]: Sprite?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charles, getting Charles up here real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you learn French?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you learn French?
[SPEAKER_01]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_01]: East Kildonan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The school was in Sacré-Coeur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you originally from Winnipeg?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father was one of the people who was
there when the construction started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better than wax and chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do this just with the bubble tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me lighting up the chalice with
the pow-wow-wow-wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light it up with the pow-wow-wow-wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We light the chalice with the
pow-wow-wow-wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We light the chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you from, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born and bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm from, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Elmwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?
[SPEAKER_02]: Elmwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowman Avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pespler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pespler?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 15 blocks away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he blew the water in, so you might have
to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did?
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew the water in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're seeing the sparks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's lucky he didn't crack the quartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, that's nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tip for Kittis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's going to go perform soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pespler's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes all the way out here from
Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get dabbed out by a Winnipegger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to make it so... If you don't
know the person... If you don't know the
[SPEAKER_02]: person...
[SPEAKER_02]: $4,000 or $5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know a guy named Enrico Pouchard in
Quebec?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Enrico Pouchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying, who's Enrico Pouchard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not an ME.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smokes a notch of 40 years plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I ain't done that in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Kimball?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know the guy that made the banks
for the X-Hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm Gio's nephew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met Gio at Kimball's place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I put the band together for the new
channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Gio when I was 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to my uncle Gio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going fishing up at our cabin that
I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm bringing him in this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: August 3rd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, I'll try to be out there for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either at North Cape or the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either at Carver or... No, I just mean
out, like, to Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always in BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy Wright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must know Chris out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is the star.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're heading out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just hitting it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here, he's hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a line going, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's he hitting?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hitting a little of the blue and the
jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parrish is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parrish is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give it a steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte, good to meet you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give a shout out to Bubble
Man's World?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where can they see your music?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, King Charlotte and you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to grab my phone number?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a phone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried ganja before and I
thought this would be a good occasion to
[SPEAKER_02]: give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, one time I had a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, dude, I had a dude that looked
almost exactly like you, a friend of my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend Richard's from California who owns
dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought his buddy over to my booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's many of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I haven't smoked hash in 25
years, but I think this might be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: time to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I shit you not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hit him with one dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fell straight back like a board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then was like kind of shaken a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he opened his eyes and he got up
and he was kind of like, wow, that was an
[SPEAKER_02]: unbelievable experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny to say the least.
[SPEAKER_02]: 865.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a local number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's steaming like a steam pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water hash made with water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use water and ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the resin off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were the one that blew into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you blow water into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's why we didn't want you
touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Richie did that the first time,
so we forgive him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew it right through my mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, Kittis did it one time and
it hit him in the face, the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how hard he blew it off,
which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make up for any blow if you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no need to blow, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a game of inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, are we selling some cake now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got good drink here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, this is ready for whoever's hitting
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony says I'm hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you hit it, you can blow whatever
direction you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't blow through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good rip.
That's a good rip.
That's a good rip.
