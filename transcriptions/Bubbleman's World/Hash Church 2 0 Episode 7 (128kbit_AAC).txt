[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World and welcome
to Hash Church 2.0, episode seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of threw this one together on a whim
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't have any invites that I put
together or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just figured, hey, we've got the ability
to stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should get this happening and put
another stream together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put the invitations out via
email and Facebook and Messenger.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how that goes real quickly
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, boom, shaboom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, Mr. Shaldone, Mr. Dr. Shaldone
will pop in and share some goodness with
[SPEAKER_05]: us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest says that his internet is down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Etienne says he's taken the day off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to respect that for a guy
that's pretty much been here for every
[SPEAKER_05]: single Hash Church episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Already 171 viewers in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B comes in and blows my eardrums
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic, probably on a phone or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so loud, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, I'm afraid to unmute it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might blow his eardrums out again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got to love it, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Marcus, how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All's well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it certainly has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell ya.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's been new and different in the world
of Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: Concerts and chemistry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I've been busy starting up a
couple facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: One about two hours south of where I live
in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And got a couple other projects going on
in other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still working on the hydrogenation and
have a potential collaboration to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacology on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're in discussion right now with a
licensed producer in California to do a
[SPEAKER_04]: limited introduction of I think we're
going to make like a thousand pans or
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe like 1,500 pans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still in certain negotiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're still developing the
hydrogenation technology and getting labs
[SPEAKER_04]: started up in multiple different states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have projects in Florida, North Dakota,
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pennsylvania project was sort of put
on hold because there's a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The existing license holders right now are
suing the state to put a hold on their
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The group that I'm associated with is sort
of like taking a hiatus until that issue
[SPEAKER_04]: gets resolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is basically groups that are
consists of like myself as a processing
[SPEAKER_04]: guy, like a cultivation team, a security
team, and basically putting together a
[SPEAKER_04]: plan to retrofit existing facilities or in
some cases build entirely new buildings
[SPEAKER_04]: for the purpose of growing and cultivating
cannabis and in most cases, because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with it, processing into oils
and formulated products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the regulations are all different in
different states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically it's the same type of
process that you would use for any type of
[SPEAKER_04]: botanical essential oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, so a lot of these states are
allowing solvent and non-solvent
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks are sort of limiting their
processing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know folks who are doing only CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're choosing to do solvent lists,
you know, rosin and butane extract just
[SPEAKER_04]: because the butane extracts are very
popular category right now amongst these
[SPEAKER_04]: new states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, the introduction of
concentrates to the markets in
[SPEAKER_04]: Pennsylvania and Maryland has been very
successful and we're seeing incredible
[SPEAKER_04]: growth and great growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tamir who worked with Kind Bill out in
Colorado is now running a lab in Cresco in
[SPEAKER_04]: Pennsylvania and they're doing really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they can't keep their
concentrates on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things are going well in the rollout of
cannabis facilities out east in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to report.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, another Sunday,
another Hash Church episode seven this
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figured we'd, you know, throw one together
without any organization whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sort of do it old school,
see who's around, see what the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation can, what we can come up
with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your YouTube?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is someone left their YouTube on that I
can hear myself talking through just out
[SPEAKER_05]: of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your YouTube?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is someone left their YouTube on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Sam's.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear it through Sam's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash Church foul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it, but I had my headphones on this
morning, so it didn't, nobody heard it
[SPEAKER_05]: except me, but I definitely did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, anyone got melt?
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn your YouTube off, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: I screwed up on a Melty Friday there,
but I've been sifting away here this
[SPEAKER_10]: morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, go to the YouTube and then mute it
or just shut it off completely.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I was in the middle of the
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a question, Mark, in regards to your
hydrogenation process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really fully understanding exactly
what's going on there, what the benefits
[SPEAKER_05]: are, how you came up with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you kind of give us a little bit of a,
I'm sure you've talked about it before,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just sort of for the people like
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we do when we convert the
tetrahydrocannabinoids, which are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, to the hexahydrocannabinoids is
we're adding a molecule of hydrogen across
[SPEAKER_04]: the double bond of the molecule THCA or
CBDA or whatever we're hydrogenating in a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the double bond is the, if you're
looking at the structure of THCA,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's sort of like the chicken wire
representation sort of like of what the
[SPEAKER_04]: molecule looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the top ring and at the top of the
ring, the top of the three rings there,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a double bond and that double bond
is eliminated when it's hydrogenated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're saturating the double bond by
adding hydrogen to it and making it go
[SPEAKER_04]: away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's Delta-8 or Delta-9,
those are different positions,
[SPEAKER_04]: different isomeric positions of the double
bond.
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on which isomer you have,
it doesn't make a difference anymore
[SPEAKER_04]: because we've hydrogenated it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hydrogenation basically is a way of
converting the tetrahydrocannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the plant into the
hexahydrocannabinoids, which is what HHCA
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that makes pretty damn good sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what have you seen sort of beneficial
from turning tetra to hexa?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the data that we had presented in our
patent was some data that showed that mice
[SPEAKER_04]: that were implanted with glioblastoma
tumors had slightly smaller tumors when
[SPEAKER_04]: they had a diet of the hydrogenated
cannabinoids versus the diet of their
[SPEAKER_04]: non-hydrogenated starting material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was part of the reason why we got
an invention on it because you couldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have predicted that result.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until we carried it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like new and unexpected.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, ooh, surprisingly we find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the reduction in tumor size was
just a little bit smaller in the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that might have to do with,
again, they have different metabolic
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles in the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how they're degraded and what kind
of half-life they may or may not have and
[SPEAKER_04]: what kind of activity is directly tied to
making those tumors slightly smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the mice that had no cannabinoids
administered at all had much larger
[SPEAKER_04]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cannabinoids in the diet showed a
tumor, a reduction in tumor size.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately this is something that it
was just used to show that these things do
[SPEAKER_04]: have biological activity for the utility
on the patent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Mark, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Several double bonds in the resourcinal
mode on THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did those things get hydrogenated as well
when you guys treat this?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just the single double bond,
the methylcyclohexene group so that the
[SPEAKER_04]: benzene is stable and does not
hydrogenate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another thing that we were able to
show is that we can hydrogenate the acid
[SPEAKER_04]: group itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we hydrogenate the acid group,
we make a hydroxymethyl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we convert what used to be a carboxylic
acid into now a hydroxymethyl group,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a novel composition of the matter
that we have covered in our patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're sort of developing ways to not
only and when you do the hydrogenation,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is an important aspect of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It generates two diastereomers because the
hydrogenation could happen from the top
[SPEAKER_04]: side of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which pushes the methyl group back and
makes a stereocenter because the new
[SPEAKER_04]: stereocenter is a tetrahedral carbon,
which is asymmetric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the methyl group will go sort of
like down into the plane of the computer
[SPEAKER_04]: screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if the catalyst comes from underneath,
the methyl group goes outside the computer
[SPEAKER_04]: screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those get different properties,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right handed and a left handed
diastereomer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So last year, a group at the University of
Pennsylvania collaborated with El Soli and
[SPEAKER_04]: published a paper on the modeling of
oxygenated cannabinoids inside the CB1
[SPEAKER_04]: receptor site.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you all know now, the CB1 receptor
site's crystal structure has been solved
[SPEAKER_04]: by basically crystallizing a high affinity
ligand for the receptor and basically
[SPEAKER_04]: doing very, very sophisticated
crystallography work tied together with
[SPEAKER_04]: computation to basically solve what the
inside of these receptors look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've started a collaboration with the
group up at UPenn on modeling hydrogenated
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it turns out, that part of the active
site is very sterically promiscuous in
[SPEAKER_04]: that there can accommodate a lot of
different stereochemical baggage,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you will, or clutter, because there's a
huge hydrophobic cleft or cavity inside
[SPEAKER_04]: the active site of CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're actually modeling both the
right handed and the left handed
[SPEAKER_04]: diastereomer inside the active site and
definitely seeing some slight differences
[SPEAKER_04]: between the diastereomers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have them separated just yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can separate them chromatographically by
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would need to do them by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still working on a method for that
and basically carrying that out to
[SPEAKER_04]: basically separate the two diastereomers
that are made, one pure crystalline Delta
[SPEAKER_04]: 9, which is purified and isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have really very good NMR data.
[SPEAKER_04]: To say that it's very, very pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we hydrogenate that, we see about a
one to one mixture of each of the
[SPEAKER_04]: diastereomers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to separate those right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, under slightly different
reaction conditions, we could reduce the
[SPEAKER_04]: acids down to the hydroxymethyl groups,
which create abundant opportunities now to
[SPEAKER_04]: do further chemistry to see how far we can
push nucleotides into groups into that
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrophobic pocket of CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just don't know because these
compounds have never been made before,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we'll start making a whole bunch of
derivatives here and testing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we even put out a paper maybe a year
or so ago on DNA variants in CNR1 that may
[SPEAKER_07]: have an impact on the structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Macrianas's lab up here in Boston,
I think played a role in that crystal
[SPEAKER_07]: structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably are too rare in the
population for you guys to be concerned
[SPEAKER_07]: with right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're an interesting dynamic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That crystal structure has helped
tremendously being able to now predict
[SPEAKER_07]: things like this, which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys going to be present at the
ICRS in Leiden, Holland next month?
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got another conflicting thing this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But looking forward to next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've never been before.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be my first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Sam's been going for decades or
whatnot, however long it's been around
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this will be my first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking very forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like what you've been doing,
Mark, would be very much up there,
[SPEAKER_05]: Ali, for a presentation, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been dying to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget why.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must conflict with the fish show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget the reason why I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I discussed this with Ryan at length.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ryan had been tugging on me to go for
years, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, definitely I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not this particular one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Sam, you just can't figure out how to
shut off the YouTube chat so we don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to hear our voices coming through your
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a mute button on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to mute it for now because
that's like my pet peeve, numero uno.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure he'll figure out how to shut
off the YouTube chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different from the Google chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go into the YouTube chat where the
actual chat is happening and you just mute
[SPEAKER_05]: the talking on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can turn the sound right down or
you can click the little bell and it'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just mute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's or just shut it
completely off.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just close the whole page,
it'll also stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's super interesting, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I didn't really catch on
to that the other times that you explained
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's very just unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I had worked on this project
while I was employed at DuPont to to take
[SPEAKER_04]: catmint oil, which we obtained by steam
distillation and then hydrogenate that
[SPEAKER_04]: oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So catmint oil itself is a very fragrant,
pungent, almost very overly powering,
[SPEAKER_04]: herbaceous material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it itself is a good insect repellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it's hydrogenated, it improves
the fragrance of the material from loud,
[SPEAKER_04]: herbaceous, like freshly mowed grass,
like not very pleasant to lemony,
[SPEAKER_04]: minty with a hint of licorice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the notion is that, you know,
we just took this plant oil which is rich
[SPEAKER_04]: with unsaturated compounds and did a
chemical modification of the plant oil to
[SPEAKER_04]: improve its stability, fragrance,
shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, typically hydrogenation is used
to improve shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody always asked me and they'd
say, well, hydrogenation of vegetable fat,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not good because it makes trans
fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's true that trans fats are made
in that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we hydrogenate extra extracts,
we're hydrogenating, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts that are highly refined and
either, you know, crystalline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did we did hydrogenate some sauces,
some some sort of terpene rich extracts
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be sort of fall into that sauce
category.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a lot of terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the hydrogenation process,
the terpenes are hydrogenated as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so each different genetic,
which has a different you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: expression in different terpene profiles
all will have a different now profile of
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenated terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we don't even begin to
think that we can even begin to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: what that does or, you know, we need to
explore that thoroughly and find out,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like when you hydrogenate mercy,
for example, you take it down to a fully
[SPEAKER_04]: saturated hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now more like a solvent than a
fragrant molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to understand like the impact that that
has on all of the terpenes is is just a
[SPEAKER_04]: really monumental challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any ways to accidentally
hydrogenate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked that as a question, because I
don't know how much of that is public,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it seems as if.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just like a can of worms
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it turns out we found out and this was
again a connection that Kevin had made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of a group that was out in Vegas that was
unintentionally hydrogenating some
[SPEAKER_04]: distillate while they were making it and
they didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chemist who had actually looked at
this actually wasn't a chemist,
[SPEAKER_04]: he was a microbiologist by training,
but a really sharp guy was able to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: it out and knew about our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from Hash Church, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that right, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or he knew about it from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he knew about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he knew about me, because he knew
about the patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so he and I don't exactly know
like how that whole thing resolved,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the group that regulates that
market is what the Division of Taxation
[SPEAKER_04]: City of Las Vegas or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was brought up at one of the
hearings of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't exactly know what the fate of
it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so the molecules are prone to
hydrogenation if given the right
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these people and their distillate
process was somehow beating on the
[SPEAKER_04]: molecule in the right way to add hydrogen
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to figure out exactly,
you know, get to the bottom of that and
[SPEAKER_04]: find out, you know, what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you have to like get the terpenes
out separate, you think, so that you
[SPEAKER_07]: isolate the cannabinoids and only
hydrogenate those and then add the terms
[SPEAKER_07]: back just to not concern you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because as you say, that's like
you hydrogenate everything, entourage
[SPEAKER_07]: effect that is completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I and again, the chemical
modification of what the plant provides is
[SPEAKER_04]: a different thing of doing it to the
active ingredient itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've, you know, most of our focus has
been on the active ingredient itself,
[SPEAKER_04]: just to make sure that we understand,
you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the structure itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're collaborating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you may have been useful in
helping set this up, Kevin, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it took several interactions and
several phone calls.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Guillermo Moreno Sans, who now is
affiliated with the university over in
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain, is actually the one that's going to
be doing our CB1 binding studies for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it turns out, it's so exceedingly
difficult to do that in the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: for all the schedule one bullshit reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have some other interest from
the researchers up at Temple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've touched base with Sarah Jane Ward
up there who has a mouse test for pain
[SPEAKER_04]: induced by chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very interesting, again,
test for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really important to for us to get
it into this ALS mouse test that that Mary
[SPEAKER_04]: a boot has a good temple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there's just stupid regulations
that keeps things from happening and keeps
[SPEAKER_04]: us from being able to have access to these
researchers who are actually paid with
[SPEAKER_04]: government funding, my tax dollars,
which go to these government agencies,
[SPEAKER_04]: which give funding to professors that have
assays from my compound that I can't test
[SPEAKER_04]: because of some government bullshit,
which is totally sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I don't know how I diverted
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the important thing is that we're
focusing on the active ingredient itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to make direct comparisons
with what the hydrogenation does to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and what it does compared to
their non hydrogenated counterparts and
[SPEAKER_04]: see if we can understand again,
from a molecular point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: once we look at the binding and see,
does it gain from having this
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenation and perhaps again,
a different metabolic fate that these
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids may have might change their
pharmacokinetic profile, which really
[SPEAKER_04]: impacts on how effective they are and
their duration of activity once they're
[SPEAKER_04]: administered to humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's intense, but definitely also making
sense what Kevin said in regards to
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially doing the cannabinoids and
reintroducing the terpenes, especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're turning the terpenes into like full
blown solvents in the case of mercy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and the case of like beta
cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_04]: So beta cariophylline, as it turns out,
is a component in catmint oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we hydrogenate in catmint oil,
we also hydrogenated beta cariophylline
[SPEAKER_04]: and it turns it into something called
cariophylline and humaline into humaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are these are known compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess again, yeah, when you take
what nature provides in the botanical
[SPEAKER_04]: mixture within the plant and now you're
doing a chemical modification to that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and you're modifying everything in
the plant, yeah, you're rolling the dice
[SPEAKER_04]: on, say, a negative type of synergistic or
entourage or ensemble effect, right,
[SPEAKER_04]: where things could basically synergize in
a negative way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to totally understand,
you know, what the impact that that has
[SPEAKER_04]: and the safety and ultimately like how
that really, you know, does improve or
[SPEAKER_04]: does not improve the activity of these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone was asking in regards to
something about Delta 8 being produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that happening in the hydrogenation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what we found is that very,
very sporadically, this was just a test
[SPEAKER_04]: that we had not really run before.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we had first done a
hydrogenation, we let it go overnight,
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus, where we're shaking the
hydrogenation overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we worked it up to the next day,
we had about a 22 percent mixture of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta 8 acid in there, which nobody had
actually or it turns out Mishum had
[SPEAKER_04]: characterized it once before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to correct myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a there's a one paper and it's was
presented to me when I was at the ACS
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting in New Orleans last month or a
couple of months ago where, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta 8 acid was once before reported in
the literature, but it's very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Delta 8 acid is actually made by
the isomerization of the Delta 9 acid,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is made in the plant to Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just very rare to observe that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we observe that and characterize it
by HPLC mass spec.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a cool that was a paper that I
gave at the New Orleans ACS meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, you could hydrogenate Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't matter where the double
bond is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's even more exciting to talk
about THC isomers or isomers for a second
[SPEAKER_04]: is that there seems to be a preponderance
of thinking that in a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_04]: distillate that the Delta 10 isomer is
showing up and Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could easily envision just being an
isomer isation of the double bond into
[SPEAKER_04]: conjugation with the aromatic ring,
which is basically going to introduce a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of ring strain because it's a
tricyclic system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you gain a little bit of energy
because you're dropping that double bond
[SPEAKER_04]: now in the conjugation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the other thing is that that proton,
the benzilic proton there is highly
[SPEAKER_04]: resolvable in the proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that means is that if we are
forming Delta 10, that we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: totally see the disappearance of that
proton in the NMR.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, a fellow by the name of Zach
Jordan, who I think is a hash church
[SPEAKER_04]: watcher, he's a moderator of a couple
different Facebook pages around
[SPEAKER_04]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he sells equipment and builds
rooms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A fellow named Zach Jordan is actually
going to be providing a sample to the
[SPEAKER_04]: group over in Fort Collins to run a NMR of
that and we'll be able to see again,
[SPEAKER_04]: try to characterize whether or not this
Delta 10 isomer, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_04]: characterizing it as CBG, just because
that's where CBG runs in the HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not even CBG, but it's like CBGA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it totally can't be CBGA because it's
in distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no A in distillate, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people just don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this phantom peak that's in a lot of
people's distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of us who think that it's
probably Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great to not only identify it as
Delta 10 THC, but then a potential
[SPEAKER_04]: financial opportunity for whoever could
come up with the right process to make
[SPEAKER_04]: standards of Delta 10, because those
standards go for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have to be sold at the DEA,
dilution and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you even need a schedule and
license to produce those, if I remember
[SPEAKER_04]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just, again, another isomer
that's in distillate that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: mischaracterized for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think it might be Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing I just wanted to say about
cannabinoids, because we're starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: get testing results that are grouped down
in Maryland, is a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_04]: testing for the propyl cannabinoids,
CBDV and THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not testing for the
corresponding acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So THCVA and CBDVA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be interested if anyone knows about
whether or not those are being tested for
[SPEAKER_04]: or in other places, or anyone knows about
origins of standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the things that
Steve Hill will get back to me and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, we can only test for them if we have
standards available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like chicken or the egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really need the standards in order to
basically be able to identify them for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure in the chromatogram and then be able
to do a suitable concentration dilution
[SPEAKER_04]: curve to make sure that your response
factor between peak height or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you're measuring is linear with
concentration, is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wanna do like a couple series of
10-fold dilutions, do those injections in
[SPEAKER_04]: your HPLC, make sure you get a beautiful
linear correlation, and then you know that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can basically make those assignments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe again, this is again tightening
up part of the uncertainty of when you do
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid analysis of concentrates and
extracts, and you only get like numbers
[SPEAKER_04]: that add up to 85 or 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's the rest of it?
You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want that acid form in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you should be able to use the acid
forms as a QC in many ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see the same acid to
decarboxylation ratio in the purple versus
[SPEAKER_07]: the pentyl molecules, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: In any sort of extract, and you should
sort of see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they differentially decarboxylate
to some degree, but you shouldn't see
[SPEAKER_07]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do an HPLC analysis, Kevin, of an extract
that was taken at very low temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to believe you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we see very little
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wondering if anybody else had
known about whether or not people are
[SPEAKER_04]: testing for the acids of the propyl
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the real question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone knows about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know offhand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll look into the folks that I know,
but it would certainly be helpful to get
[SPEAKER_07]: an LC-MS on there, just so you're not
questioning whether, if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: standard, you don't need one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, again, this speaks to,
again, being able to hijack these pathways
[SPEAKER_04]: and put them in the yeast and be able to
get yeast to express cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: expressly for making the analytical
standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's no uncertainty about making
whatever, whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That yeast is only spitting out that
molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is why, again, modern
techniques and biotechnology can be used,
[SPEAKER_04]: utilized and harnessed in the industry for
these types of reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see any microbial hydrogenation
that could be at play or is that mostly,
[SPEAKER_06]: they mostly hydroxylate stuff on the,
on the tails?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My, actually the hallmark of microbial
degradation is, is, is oxidation,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so typically like when you look at
those compounds that El Soli had claimed
[SPEAKER_04]: as, you know, new cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were new cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the existing cannabinoids that
were chewed on by bacteria and other bugs
[SPEAKER_04]: to basically hydroxylate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bugs like to hydroxylate stuff because
they're turning stuff into food and
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately trying to mineralize the carbon
into CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you're, you're basically,
you know, pseudomonad bacterias and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these other bacterias and all these other
fungi basically start hydroxylating the
[SPEAKER_04]: shit out of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's how the degradation of
wood and wood pulp and cellulose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you bury paper in the soil and you
come back a couple of weeks later,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gone, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because these, you know,
bacteria basically just depolymerize
[SPEAKER_04]: cellulose by Fenton chemistry,
which is single electron chemistry that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that you could certainly
intervene in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of
chemistry that's going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't even know if that was the
answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think you did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen similar papers on hydroxylation
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's different than what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, typically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think about, again,
bacterial, yeah, and just even oxidation
[SPEAKER_04]: in the liver and most like what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, again, where perhaps
hydrogenation could help because the sites
[SPEAKER_04]: typically of both metabolic and thermo
oxidative degradation are in the proximity
[SPEAKER_04]: of where those double bonds and those
degrees of unsaturation are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps again, just perhaps the
metabolic fate of these molecules will
[SPEAKER_04]: influence their pharmacokinetics enough to
perhaps lower their effective dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a hypothesis right now,
but a testable one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some high caliber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientific talk for nine thirty a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Laughter in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was heavy, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was I was just about to speak up
and say that I have gratitude for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are willing to do the deep work
on what all's going on with our various
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to thank Kevin for posting a link
to Arno Hadley.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a camps paper on various extraction
techniques, I was really struck by he was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing naphtha ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember all of the reagents,
but the one that stuck out to me was olive
[SPEAKER_00]: oil as a solvent for and doing a water and
oil extraction of plant material and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting really good results on keeping the
terpenes and a full range of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys have like as you said,
Marcus, it's Sunday morning on the West
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really deep conversation for
Sunday morning for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I was really struck by with with
this with the science guys, Mark or Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: or you, Marcus, talk about what's what's
going on with olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the challenge for the work that I
do is concentrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting enough cannabinoids into a
olive oil extraction to be meaningful for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the folks we're trying to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was really struck by the the results
I saw in that paper suggested that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was really good extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something people can do in
their kitchen at home and grow their own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a thing that's really
important from my point of view is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all should have access to this plant in
whatever form we want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a harmful thing for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can abuse it and overuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, the way Mark and Kevin
and so many other people are really
[SPEAKER_00]: digging at the science of what's going on
with cannabis and humans and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want people as much as possible
to be able to make this medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, to be able to concentrate it
into a form that's useful for their bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: or their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys know so much about all the
different ways this plant gets played
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's people who are
listening that probably know more about
[SPEAKER_00]: this than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I was really struck by
that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to thank you, Kevin,
for posting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to shush and let some
other folks talk because, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, the real key here is normalizing
cannabis, helping people understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just about how high can you get,
which is a beautiful side effect that I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally love very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also really is a healing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making it available to people is a
game changing thing on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sit here and listen now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, glad you came in and shared with us,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope your back's doing better.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you sitting at?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're sitting there in a grow room
puffing on hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm just hanging out in my room
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been down for a few months.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and doing some sift, you know,
cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buds on the you know, I got some buds here
that I need to sift and make some rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got I got some chocolate, which is just
really beautiful quality on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little bit of cookies that I'm
Boveda packing, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have still like 100 grams of
where is my bike, which I'm using your Med
[SPEAKER_05]: booster packs there that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting it all ready for actually
squishing the choco lopes nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to sift that and maybe make some
bubble out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to squish the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here in the next little bit,
I got all sorts of good flavors and I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: going to say I did a test with one of
those humidity packs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought it down to like 33% for sifting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that was too much because
I had a lot of plant material.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dry, dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget Skunkman telling me
years ago, it's not a misnomer to dry
[SPEAKER_05]: sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a misnomer to dry sift and
getting the heads to actually go from this
[SPEAKER_05]: big, you know, perfect water balloon down
to a shriveled up grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just seem to be more readily
available to first extract gently,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also to clean as well, depending on
what methods you're using to clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know for squishing, 62% seems to
be the magic number.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, for sifting, I'm always trying
to figure out, you know, I bring my room
[SPEAKER_10]: down to 42% when I'm doing the first
bounce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that seems to be, I like 42,
420, of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that seems to be my magic number.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, Sam and some other people out
there, I mean, thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Humidity levels for when we are sifting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I tried even in the freezer,
but too much plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in the very beginning you were
teaching me and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going back to some old thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get your things figured out there,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you sound perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well then I guess I got it fixed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can't see you anymore,
but we can hear you to near perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, that's because what I've done
is I turned my mic off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I turned everything else off and facing
the, the computer and I felt
[SPEAKER_09]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I put a piece of tape over it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, you pull into Mark Zuckerberg.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have a question for, oh,
did Mark leave the room?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's an acid in a neutral fraction,
then you're creating for isomer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isomers, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Say that again.
No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you, you hydrogenate an acid form of a
cannabinoid or a neutral form or both of
[SPEAKER_09]: them together, whatever, but then four
different isomers are created by that
[SPEAKER_09]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so the reduction of the acid
group happens in a neutral fraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a different hydrogenation process,
uh, with a different catalyst.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, I mean, if you're making a
mixture and you have both the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroxymethyl and that the acid form would
be four, four different compounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: because every time you do a hydrogenation,
you're going to make a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_04]: methyl going up and you're going to make a
little bit of the methyl going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because you already have established
stereochemistry at multiple centers within
[SPEAKER_04]: that molecule, those compounds are
different compounds and are resolvable.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are called diastereomers that we
could actually see different peaks on in
[SPEAKER_04]: the, in both the NMR and in the HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, when I hydrogenate crystalline
pure Delta nine THCA that it is just
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely pristine, pure crystalline,
very, very clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Chris at the clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we hydrogenate that we see just about
a one-to-one mixture of each of the
[SPEAKER_04]: diastereomers of H8CA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what the methyl going up and the
methyl going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Marcus, I'm looking in the,
in the chat here, you had said something
[SPEAKER_04]: that Tony Nag asked about a Delta nine
being a red color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me comment on the red color for a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a few people have identified this in
distillate and the red may or may not be
[SPEAKER_04]: to a trace amount of a flavonoid that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very highly prone to either being
very yellow or very red.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that in some of the CBD stuff
that I'm seeing where I'm seeing sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a Ruby red or more like a,
a, it's a less Amber red, but more of like
[SPEAKER_04]: a, more of like a fuchsia red,
like almost like a Ruby red is the best
[SPEAKER_04]: way that I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that that impurity is the,
the hydroxyquinone, which is a known
[SPEAKER_04]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look in Mishulam's paper,
just Google CBD chemical aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see a reference to paper where he
sees oxidation products of CBD forming
[SPEAKER_04]: these highly conjugated material called
quinones, which are usually red in color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, I think the Ruby red color is
that hydroxyquinone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the what's called the beam
test.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a beam test that's used to
differentiate CBD from THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where one of the components turns red.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other component turns
blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's THC, it turns red.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's CBD, that red color that you're
making is that hydroxyquinone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that may or may not be the color Tony
Nag that you're, that you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the color of Delta 10
is, but I can tell you, I just got a text
[SPEAKER_04]: from Zach Jordan last night on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The material that he sent me was pretty,
pretty clear or let me just say it's off
[SPEAKER_04]: white.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looked pretty pure or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we'll have an NMR of it
hopefully pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we have the results, we'll,
we'll share it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Delta 10 is definitely a
culprit, a phantom peak in a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people's distillate these days.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully you were mentioning Delta
eight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you find Delta eight in herbal cannabis
or is it strictly an artifact of lab work?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just that Delta eight I think is
formed on the, the processing of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Delta eight is, is favored by,
so it did the MM two calculations on the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire tricyclic structure minus the C
five tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anybody who knows anything about
molecular modeling, it would have taken a
[SPEAKER_04]: much longer time to solve the structures
because of the infinite number of
[SPEAKER_04]: different populations that that C five
alkyl tail is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we chopped off that alkyl tail and we
modeled the Delta eight versus Delta nine
[SPEAKER_04]: thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so ground state calculations show that
Delta eight's favored by a little over a K
[SPEAKER_04]: cal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if given the opportunity, that double
bond will walk over from Delta nine to
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta eight, and that can be favored by
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be favored by acid, most
particularly acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, if you look at that,
if that, at that machine paper where they
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about the cyclization of CBD to make
a THC, that it goes to Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they use a non-prodic Lewis acid like
boron trifluoride, which again promotes a
[SPEAKER_04]: different type of carbonium ion based
mechanism to close the ring, to make THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and their Delta nine is favored.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you use prodic acid like
sulfuric or, or, you know, more common,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, acids, methane, sulfonic and
stuff like that, those are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: basically favor the generation of,
because Delta eight is favored if given
[SPEAKER_04]: the opportunity to summarize from Delta
nine to Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to round this up and be clear,
this is not happening in a living plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this is not happening in a living
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing it in a lab or it's
biological pH won't do this alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this, this is happening on the
processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe Delta eight is naturally
occurring in Delta nine acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is not naturally occurring either,
but it's, it's an important cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Delta nine acid is what occurs in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the two things that are unstable about
it is the carboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all know it's prone to formal
decarboxylation, but also the double bond
[SPEAKER_04]: is prone to isomerization from Delta
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: If given the opportunity, will I summarize
to Delta nine?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, these are things that yes,
don't happen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, on, you know, human processing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, have you ever looked at,
uh, hydrogen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, hydrogenated CBD Kevin had better
efficacy, uh, in, in our mouse,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, uh, data with, with glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, given the legal
landscape, hydrogenated CBD is certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: a, um, a, uh, sort of direct to market,
you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that's probably going to be a
lot easier to deal with in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, all these compounds that
have double bonds in them will all
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the idea is to lightly
hydrogenate, but then recombine those with
[SPEAKER_04]: other things, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a chemical refinement step
that can be applied along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ultimate thing is to take the
cannabinoid out, hydrogenate it re and add
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpenes and, uh, basically function
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's a second double bond
hanging off of CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that get hydrogenated as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go to the Michelin paper,
the journal of medicinal chemistry from
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006, you'll find out that they actually
did the hydrogenation of CBD, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: to make both the, uh, uh, this
hydrogenated material and the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-hydrogenated material, which you can
just get away by using something like
[SPEAKER_04]: Wilkinson's catalyst, which will
selectively just hydrogenate one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: double bonds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a platinum based catalyst that
uses, or I'm sorry, ruthenium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, yeah, they could use a ruthenium,
but I think they use the platinum based
[SPEAKER_04]: catalyst, but there are ways to sort of
chemoselectively hydrogenate one double
[SPEAKER_04]: bond or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah, Michelin's group had looked
at this back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: They published results in the journal of
medicinal chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you'll notice that they did not
hydrogenate CBD A, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They hydrogenated CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, our concept is to basically
take what the plant is providing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are the cannabinoid acids and
hydrogenate those, which ultimately will
[SPEAKER_04]: be used to deliver the hydrogenated
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the key is to basically have that
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between what the plant makes and,
and the hydrogenated actives, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Sam's question earlier was about
that O-methyl group you were speaking
[SPEAKER_07]: about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that, when you do the hydrogenation,
do you get an O-methyl group on the
[SPEAKER_07]: carboxylic acid automatically or is that
just separate to, um, to methyl?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, O, the O-methyl group on the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't, so you mean like an ester,
like an O-methyl ester?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought you mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you had a way of putting,
you know, methyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have a way of basically taking the
acid down to the hydroxymethyl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we convert what was a carboxylic acid
into a CH2OH, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it becomes a new benzylic alcohol that
we could then decorate stuff on the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroxyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, Kevin, what I was sort of
making a connection to is who knows how
[SPEAKER_04]: much more that high area of the
hydrophobic cleft of the active site can
[SPEAKER_04]: we tolerate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's start loading it up with
methyl, ethyl, isopropyl butyl,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just start putting all kinds of groups out
there and see if we can intercalate
[SPEAKER_04]: farther into the active site of the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't know how much more steric
baggage that area of the receptor can
[SPEAKER_04]: accommodate how promiscuous it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to fluorinate it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone loves to fluorinate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the problem with fluorination,
I hear you and fluorination is actually a
[SPEAKER_04]: really very intriguing opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem with fluorine is that whenever you
put fluorine baited to a hydrogen,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're setting yourself up for the
elimination of HF.
[SPEAKER_04]: And HF for those of us who watch,
you know, Breaking Bad is what,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they dissolve the bathtub with,
okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nasty shit, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you don't want to be messing with
HF.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fluorinated stuff, there was some talk
about this and I know that Mishule made
[SPEAKER_04]: some fluorinated derivatives and fluorine
is a very, very interesting molecule
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's very polar but it's
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's very, very peculiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the issue with perfluorinated
materials, things like Teflon and other
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that is there are no natural
metabolic processes to degrade the carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: fluorine bonds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes these materials persistent
in nature, meaning that they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be around forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So geologically, you know, a million years
from now, we will be known as the Teflon
[SPEAKER_04]: era because it's all Teflon Fukushima era
because that's all that's going to remain
[SPEAKER_04]: from our era in stone, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all the fluorochemical materials
that we've released and obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: Fukushima and any other nuclear
catastrophe waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've been dealing with in my
life, I'm going to get personal for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hurt my back earlier this year,
had back surgery eight weeks ago today and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have realized that just because I can do
things doesn't mean I always should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wonder about the,
in this conversation, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of using fluorine to alter
cannabinoid structure in something that
[SPEAKER_00]: humans might consume at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels very strongly to me like this is
something we can do, but should we be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels to me like the chemical
industry is doing a long-term ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment on the planet and all the
organisms that are on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to go religious for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is church after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature can provide, I think, most of the
things that we need from this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting greedy about how,
about all the things we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, coming back to there's things that
I can do with my back being hurt that my
[SPEAKER_00]: physical therapist and whatnot tell me,
no, no, you should really just chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to be patient with your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in cannabis science,
I want to ask those of you who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: research on these kinds of things,
the things that we're discussing this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, like I said, I'm fascinated by
the science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand that much about the
plant, but I've really been struck at the
[SPEAKER_00]: healing potential in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so many folk who have seen benefit
in their own lives from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most all of those people got a version
of the plant pretty close to how it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually dried, for quite a while it's been
extractions with butters or olive oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did some period of time working with
medicine makers who were using hexane
[SPEAKER_00]: because the research that I had done
suggested that if you made sure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hexane was out, it was a really good way
of preserving cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles like you would find in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the beauties of this gap
gathering that you created here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus, is there's all different ways of
looking at and working with this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: being expressed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the science of it is something that I
really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said a couple of times already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to come back to again,
just because we can, should we.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, especially when you start
talking about medicine and at least part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Hash Church is for me, how to work
with this plant and concentrate it in ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that are beneficial, both for your head
space and the lovely vibe, like it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: said here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right to feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful healing aspect of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many other things it can do
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sam has really shown over the years
that there's all kinds of different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to get different cannabinoids from this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have to create new
plastics or new chemical compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't exist in nature as a result of our
playing with the plant because we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we can, I get nervous.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think mostly that they're using these
chlorinated or phenylated or whatever
[SPEAKER_09]: they're doing to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're using them for research
more than they're actually trying to make
[SPEAKER_09]: medicines for human beings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if research, if that allows you to
understand the mechanism of control of the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids over receptor systems,
et cetera, et cetera, I think that's a
[SPEAKER_09]: very beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And without science, we wouldn't know what
THC is.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, I'm absolutely in favor of
science, but yeah, we don't want anything
[SPEAKER_09]: that's going to harm anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can make it naturally from a
plant, of course that makes a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: more common sense and it's going to be
cheaper too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I weigh in there as well that I think
some of this desire to make non-natural
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds really is rooted back in our
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get monopolies if you change it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas if it's natural, it's very hard
for you to get these patents on things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so thus there's a desire for people to
make Rabanavan and bring out a C-E
[SPEAKER_07]: disaster, which everyone warned them
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to hit that thing and turn
it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to depress people and lo and
behold, we get suicides.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was, that temptation I think was
there because they could get IP on a
[SPEAKER_07]: molecule that was different.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're motivating society to mess with
something that's been working for
[SPEAKER_07]: millennia and modify it with a very small
amount of data.
[SPEAKER_07]: On toxicity and on how this works in the
general population.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we step in that trap, I think all the
time when we go to the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that we shouldn't pursue it to Sam's
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think, I do not view humankind as
outside of nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: I view our minds and what we create is
very similar to the intelligence that bees
[SPEAKER_07]: have building beehives and beavers making
dams.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also are sentient enough to question
longevity, perhaps a bit more than these
[SPEAKER_07]: other organisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since we're gifted with that,
perhaps we should honor it a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Mike West to the
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're froze up or if
you're still there, but welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he froze up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting to hear both sides of the
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it fascinating as well,
the science, from Sam's perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's for research, it's obviously a
beneficial thing, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Wade's perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always interesting to see where
you're coming from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I always enjoy having Wade
and Forrest on, because they're really
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from this perspective of like
helping like very sick, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: children in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you're helping sick children,
your perspective is going to be very
[SPEAKER_05]: unique and very sort of focused on that,
on that concept of like, hey, we got to be
[SPEAKER_05]: really careful what we give these,
you know, delicate, susceptible children.
[SPEAKER_05]: That are very, very, you know,
sensitive to anything that could be in the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant that maybe doesn't necessarily need
to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, who's to say what
incredible discoveries may occur in some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the work that guys like Dr. Mark are
doing in regards to helping mankind and
[SPEAKER_05]: helping us with our health and helping
unlock the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_05]: getting a deeper understanding on how it
works and all of these complex compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extremely interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe that was like a now or
solid of like intense science talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you are, Mike, you're back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you moving now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You shocked me how long your hair and
beard are, because I just picture you as
[SPEAKER_05]: this clean cut guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, oh shit, Mike's been in the
cave building extract facilities for the
[SPEAKER_05]: last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't hear you, but oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's typing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess his mic's not working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's got a bad connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to come right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to comment for a second,
Marcus, on the patent and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that the only way to really take these
through, you know, FDA sanctioned clinical
[SPEAKER_04]: trials is to really have a good,
strong proprietary position on the other
[SPEAKER_04]: side of those trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And albeit very historic what GW is doing
with Epidiolex, which is basically CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: Sativax, which is a one-to-one CBD THC for
epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side of those clinical
trials, which is going to teach the world
[SPEAKER_04]: what we already know, which is that
cannabis and these formulations to a
[SPEAKER_04]: statistically significant portion of the
population that has these diseases can be
[SPEAKER_04]: effective at controlling these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: GW will have to rely on their everything
but the active ingredient patent estate to
[SPEAKER_04]: enforce, you know, their patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, will that be able to impact the
CBD industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the sort of 800 pound gorilla
in the room is that they are taking
[SPEAKER_04]: Epidiolex through a food and drug
administration approved trial and spending
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of money doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the company that does that with our
compound will actually own the clinical
[SPEAKER_04]: trial results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, really come up with
formulated medicine the way that the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical companies can accept it,
which is by food and drug trials phase,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, new drug application and
improved approval of a new drug active
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredient and variety of different
formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that HHCA, again, look about it
as both a R&D tool to assess
[SPEAKER_04]: stereochemical promiscuity within the
active site of CB1 receptor, but also a
[SPEAKER_04]: potential probe or therapeutic in and of
itself that might have enhanced
[SPEAKER_04]: therapeutic potential for very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a good way to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: that here in Hash Church without getting
into full-blown assaulting arguments.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to have different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is the bridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is the bridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, I definitely,
for the first time, really got a better
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding in regards to what you're
doing with the hydrogenation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I just wasn't listening
before, paying too much attention to
[SPEAKER_05]: moderating, but thank you for sharing
that, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people ask me, all the time about
it, and people are concerned about when
[SPEAKER_04]: they hear about hydrogenated oils and they
know that that generates trans fats,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so right away the knee-jerk reaction
is that, oh my god, you're generating
[SPEAKER_04]: trans fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking oil is very different than
cannabis extract, and you wouldn't dab
[SPEAKER_04]: cooking oil, and to kind of talk about
what Wade was referring to with the olive
[SPEAKER_04]: oil extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, olive oil is a great, wonderful,
hydrophobic vehicle for the delivery of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis oil into a variety of different
product formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, some extracts that we like
to dab, once they're in olive oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: forget about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't dab that, because you have a
high molecular weight triglyceride oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it can be formulated into a variety of
different product formula other than
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you can dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go back to, again, having a variety,
kind of like Marcus, the way you say,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is it, the quiver, right,
the arrows in your quiver, and each one of
[SPEAKER_04]: these extraction methods, whether it's ice
water or butane or liquid nitrogen or,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my gosh, I mean, there's so many
different ways of removing trichomes and
[SPEAKER_04]: trichome medicine from the plant that all
of these just represent a different way of
[SPEAKER_04]: extracting that you can have different
products that have different terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles or different modes of action,
or like you were saying, like with the
[SPEAKER_04]: olive oil, I mean, it's always great to
whenever you make rosin chips,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you don't know if you got leaving
anything in your rosin chips, hell,
[SPEAKER_04]: just soak them in olive oil, soak them in
a little coconut oil, make some medicated
[SPEAKER_04]: oil next time you fry up some bacon,
don't just throw away that bacon fat,
[SPEAKER_04]: use it to basically, you know,
medicate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there's lots of different fat
vehicles and ways that you can extract,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I try to, you know, tend to stay away
from isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one solvent I don't like,
but everything else is open and game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have about four pounds of solvent list,
basically screened herb that I've pressed
[SPEAKER_05]: already that still has, you know,
you can see tiny little bit of rosin on
this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so what do you do with those,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: This will get plant fat extracted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you throw those in like a big tub or
something like that, throw a bunch of oil
[SPEAKER_04]: in there or like what do you process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a slow cook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, even like a process like
that, which doesn't even have to be very,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, high tech at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be almost just like a Rick
Simpson.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say Rick Simpson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crock-pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: A big Crock-pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do a low temperature extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even need to really heat it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's super low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as long as you know you're clearing
out everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why not grab all that stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you throw that stuff away?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you're eating a lot of
food, you know, you're not going to get
the results you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think the ego is so big
that you think you're so efficient in
[SPEAKER_05]: pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, I feel like I'm getting the
majority of what's there just based on the
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got 28% return.
[SPEAKER_05]: The highest I've seen it go is 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe there's 2% left.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough for me to go back and
extract that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, also another thing with rosin,
you could be very efficient in your
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction process, but you might be very
inefficient on how you remove the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: screen bag from the squished paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people, and I see it all the
time, they go to grab that bag and they
[SPEAKER_05]: rub it through the rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole edge of the bag just grabs a
chunk of rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, in one squish, that's not a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're doing 50 to 100 squishes a
day and each bag is 35 grams and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: leaving behind several percent,
it ends up being substantial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not even a large commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were doing like 500 to 1,000 a day,
imagine how much resin that ends up being
[SPEAKER_05]: for someone that even if you just did it
as a philanthropy project and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know what, we always save the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a crock pot extraction and we give
it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd see that that would make a big
difference in a lot of people's lives,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it was monetary or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Marcus, 2,000 years ago,
the Persians were using sesame oil to
[SPEAKER_09]: extract cannabis like a dry sip,
the real farmer's hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, my mic muted there for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone asked me what temperature I
pressed 28% out at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll surprise a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 220 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people will say that's too hot,
but I will explain to you that the
[SPEAKER_05]: humidity level, the moisture content of
the plant has to be high for that to
[SPEAKER_05]: really be productive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Around 60 plus percent like what John and
I were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go down below that, then the resin
actually gets affected by the heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it doesn't with the more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be why we put the water in with a
coconut oil extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: That water acts as a buffer and sort of
keeps the heat from affecting the resin
[SPEAKER_05]: and blowing out the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can assure you my rosin never tastes
like burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I opened it up for people to
smell, particularly the bike, shout out to
[SPEAKER_05]: the maple butter boys, particularly the
where is my bike, it's constantly every
[SPEAKER_05]: single person says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, wow, it is so terpenally
rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just reeks like utter dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it analyzed for, Mark,
in terms of like cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to see that if maple butter boys
have done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally haven't done that,
but I don't know what the 30% breaks down
[SPEAKER_05]: into.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say that it's pretty high in
THC and yeah, THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking to the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I better not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like walking that fine line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, the burnt popcorn tastes
like we first said, I believe right here
[SPEAKER_04]: at Hash Church that it's like a steam
distillation based process by which the
[SPEAKER_04]: water that's inside the plant material is
responsible for basically pushing
[SPEAKER_04]: everything out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a delicate balance of being
at just the right temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: just the right, the pressure, and also
just having the right balance of oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think, as you know, not all
strains are, are good for squeezing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still trying to figure that one out,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus, have you ever squeezed bone dry
material?
[SPEAKER_09]: And got high yield?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have squished bone dry materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to get lower yields and have to go
in like a second and third time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also done fat plant extractions where
I've seen higher results from bone dry
[SPEAKER_05]: material.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I really see in bone dry material
is just a deeply affected resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to collect it at the end,
it's just like popping and shattery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like almost impossible to pick up on
my dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas when I dab and when I press
anything or squish anything at,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with 60% moisture content,
it usually comes out, it might cake out
[SPEAKER_05]: and butter, but it usually comes out in a
way that I can pick it up very easily.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be interesting to measure to see
if more poppy ones, as you're calling
[SPEAKER_09]: them, are higher in THC rather than THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're definitely lower in terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I can say from my own bioassay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've squished at 69% and all I've got from
that is steam and it's actually burned me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where I've gone different
levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I found that, like you say,
the 60-62% works the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I'm curious,
I've squished really dry material at 33%,
[SPEAKER_10]: all the same material all the way up to
68%.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I look back on that video,
I think it was really hard to come off the
[SPEAKER_10]: parchment at the lower levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll have to double check that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious now that you talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I did all the different humidity
levels with the same canvas, like I put
[SPEAKER_10]: everything in jars and dried it all out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I squished everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I believe it was hard to come
off the parchment when it was dry
[SPEAKER_10]: material.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just thinking in my brain.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate you pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just prefer it less too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't enjoy it as much when the material
is too dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some cookies yesterday that I'm
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to squish, but I had to Bovee
to pack this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was much drier than I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had it in here for about 24 hours
or so now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll probably wait another 15 to 16
hours before I squish this particular bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: What would happen if you mix buds?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you put in one dry bud, one damper bud,
one dry bud, one damper bud, and then
[SPEAKER_09]: squish them together with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to do the experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never tried that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really hyped on this process having
moisture in my bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like it makes the most
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really flows.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you lose your moisture, you lose that
flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's the way you feel, I bet you
you're correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just based on how I feel exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be my ego making a mistake based
on things that aren't accurate,
[SPEAKER_05]: or it could be my bio-athletics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the bio.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the tastiest.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the nicest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it gives us our best yield,
and it's easier to clean off the parchment
[SPEAKER_10]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely going to squish a half
pound when I'm done church here.
[SPEAKER_05]: With this new machine, I got the Pure
Pressure Long Peaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I can't believe how... It's
killing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just the recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you guys something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come a long way since episode 25 of
talking about rosin, the rosin episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, let me just get that on mute there,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rosin episode where we were squishing
with hair straighteners and talking about,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, wouldn't it be cool if we had a
machine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be... That's a historic
episode when I look back at it,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was like all the things we
spoke about in there brought us,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, de-nail right away coming out with
the t-shirt press, the modified t-shirt
[SPEAKER_05]: press with dual heated plates to a company
like Sasquatch coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys have welding capabilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were herb, heady herb people busting
out this super solid, incredible press to
[SPEAKER_05]: coming to the Pure Pressure guys,
which were engineers, and they were coming
[SPEAKER_05]: at it from an engineering standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're creating LED screens,
touch screen with recipes, with all of
[SPEAKER_05]: your variables included from what you're
squishing flower key for bubble,
[SPEAKER_05]: the size of the microns bag, the length
and the width of the bag for fitting on
[SPEAKER_05]: the plates, the moisture content,
the heat of each plate, the pressure that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're using through each stage,
the emergency stop button and the dual
[SPEAKER_05]: buttons for engaging and the toggle switch
for increasing the PSI pressure via
[SPEAKER_05]: incremental PSIs, whether you want five or
10 or 20 or 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really important for when
you're...
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you that want to know quick
little rosin lesson here, when you're
[SPEAKER_05]: squishing flour, I use about 140 PSI
maximum.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flour is much softer and the bags
don't blow out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can use my plates sped up a lot more so
they close pretty fast and I can engage my
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure from 20 PSI up to 140 PSI very,
very quickly, almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be counterintuitive in the
opposite of how you would squish hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly hard solid quality bubble or
dry sift that's been cleaned up to a four
[SPEAKER_05]: or a five star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we want is we want the plates to
come down much smaller and we want to use
[SPEAKER_05]: the pressure at a much more incremental
stages rather than blasting it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would never go 140 PSI, which is
about 15,000 pounds of pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never go 140 PSI when I'm
squishing hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do a much lower process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're squishing the glands now,
not trying to get the glands off of the
[SPEAKER_05]: bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're milking the glands.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to come down really slow,
do a pre-press, let the heat sit on that
[SPEAKER_05]: hash so it melts and liquefies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally increment to maybe
upwards of 80 or 70 PSI to get your yields
[SPEAKER_05]: and to get a really nice quality bubble
rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember in the days we thought that we
had heart attacks because we're all
[SPEAKER_10]: pressing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of us, remember?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man, we were pressing cakes for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that Mark?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosin arm, like tennis elbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I invited D420K over and we were like,
hey, let's press up an ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, well, let's press up an
ounce of rosin with our hair
[SPEAKER_05]: straighteners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we sat there and we were pressing and
pressing and pressing and pressing and
[SPEAKER_05]: pressing and pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like an hour went by and I was like,
okay, we got 14 grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do 14 grams of rosin in a single
press now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just make 14 grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I put 30 or 40 grams of high grade hash
in there, I could make 20 to 25 plus grams
[SPEAKER_05]: of rosin in a single squish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the whereas my bike, I get close to
10 grams of rosin in under, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in like two minutes I have from just
flour, just boom, I just made 10 grams of
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty good for at home.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when beginning you would look
at a bag of flour and you would like,
[SPEAKER_10]: let's wash it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I used to do is wash it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you're squishing everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm squishing helping a friend out
who wants me to squish a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Learning so much about all the different
strains and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Finding out which squish better,
humidity levels, all these different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really, I love it because I get
to wash it all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and that's why the pure pressure is
such a great press because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: monitoring all of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're literally putting all of that
information, all that data goes into your
[SPEAKER_05]: recipe with the name of the cultivar that
you used.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do up to 30 different ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's nice to be able to go back and,
and understand what, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your yields were based on all of those
variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I can promise you, if you change
those variables, your, your yields will
[SPEAKER_05]: change and the quality of your rosin will
change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously the variables that are the heat
of the, of the, uh, the plates,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is actually perfect timing for D
four 20 K to come into the area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause dude, I'll never, I'll never like,
dude, I laughed so fucking hard at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry that I laughed cause I know
it was a pisser when you, when you asked
[SPEAKER_05]: me what the temperature, what the
temperature for the rosin plates were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Oh dude, like two,
two 20 or whatever between one 80 and two
[SPEAKER_05]: 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forgot to say Fahrenheit and we do
live in Canada and where we use Celsius.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just fucking, I don't know if I
was stoned that day or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: but D went and did it at like 220 Celsius
and I've never seen Ross and spit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, dude, I got it all over my
shoes and my forehead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was fucking, it was on my fucking
camera holder.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got the camera up, hold it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's all over the bottom of my hand
and my, they just spit, not like it's mad,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, that was another great experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's like a sacrifice for sure,
but what an experiment, dude, that shit
[SPEAKER_05]: was like, it was spitting out of his
press.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was, there was guys making
comments going, you know, trying to be
[SPEAKER_08]: nice, not going, Hey stupid, it's too
fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think it's a little set too
high there D and all this sort of people
[SPEAKER_08]: being nice about it, but fuck really,
they should have just said, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_08]: are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dummy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, bong rip mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get this fucking show on the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you listen to the first hour?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of, uh, Delta nine and
Delta eights and all kind of, I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: going to lie at one point in time,
it didn't even sound English.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was lost thinking about it going,
Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I better get really high to catch up on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though?
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam warned me about the ICRS recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, listen, it's very dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's researchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I say a lot, sometimes it
goes over my head and I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: damn, if it goes over Sam's head,
completely changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one I attended 25 years ago,
it was all of the funding came from the
[SPEAKER_09]: NIDA national Institute for drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that they're biased, but their
name says it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that they're biased, but they're
biased.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, it was also funded by the piss
test companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, the drug testing companies
were funding research too, but that,
[SPEAKER_09]: that was who funded everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to find something positive
about cannabis, nobody would fund it
[SPEAKER_09]: period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and to finish my thought,
that's why I think I'm actually going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be quite excited and stoked to be at the
ICRS because although I didn't understand
[SPEAKER_05]: everything Dr. Mark was saying this
morning on the same level as Kevin seemed
[SPEAKER_05]: to understand it, I definitely felt like
it was intriguing and interesting and I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to hear more about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking forward to the ICRS.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need to know, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: What, if you didn't understand it,
chances are a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, it's just, it's not that I
didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood the basis of what you were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know all the terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all the interactions on the
same level that you may take for granted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've, I found it very interesting
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone has any questions or just reach
out and chat or reach out to me on
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried to break it down to make it as
simple as.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and you, and you did don't get me
wrong, but the terminologies are
[SPEAKER_05]: nonetheless the terminologies that are
required to use when discussing chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, some of that was just a,
went a little deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, Mike West.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any thoughts to share on our
interesting discussion this morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love it, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I've seen a lot of, because now
that there's a lot of farms and labs that
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing processing, when they do their
distillation, they're doing fractional
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation of cannabinoids using a broad
spectrum of different types of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them obviously are doing it at
hotter or lower temperatures, ranging
[SPEAKER_01]: from, I guess, 150s up to the 200s under
vacuum centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely do see I think there was
a comment earlier seeing the oxidization
[SPEAKER_01]: of some of those cannabinoids and
pigments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Mark, I'd assume I'm seeing
more degradation in the short paths than
[SPEAKER_01]: in the rolled films that we're doing
because of the shorter residence time at
[SPEAKER_01]: those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of it has to do with,
you got to remember when you put these
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds, I'm sorry, my wife's running
her hairdryer in the other room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that obnoxious?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I shut the door?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll shut the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not so bad, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my headphones on and it's really
very light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the key is you got to remember
when you heat up your distillation pot and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing these high temperature vacuum
distillations to make distillate,
[SPEAKER_04]: that you want to put as clean a precursor
into that pot as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say clean, free of things that
are going to thermally degrade to make
[SPEAKER_04]: noxious flavors that are going to not only
taint your distillate, but potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: could be hazardous to your health.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of these pesticides and a
lot of other residues that could
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially be in a distillate pot you
want to make sure that they're not in
[SPEAKER_04]: there to begin with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So full winterization to where you don't
see any precipitation in an ethanol
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate frozen down to minus 40
because any fat or lipids or waxes that
[SPEAKER_04]: remain in your distillate precursor,
when you go to heat it up are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: degrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they degrade, they degrade into
noxious smelling compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may recognize the burnt,
you know, rubber sort of flavor in some
[SPEAKER_04]: distillate that sometimes again is a
hallmark of distillate that's made from
[SPEAKER_04]: precursor that wasn't completely fully
winterized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the winterization again followed by
a lot of people are doing a variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: different methods or scrubs to sort of
clean up their distillate precursor to
[SPEAKER_04]: remove traces of unwanted component.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you want to try to make what you put
under thermal load in your distillation
[SPEAKER_04]: pot as clean as it possibly can,
because a lot of those compounds end up
[SPEAKER_04]: degrading thermally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, they'll co-distill with the
cannabinoids and you'll get phantom peaks
[SPEAKER_04]: in your GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are using things like molecular
sieves, clays and carbons again to clean
[SPEAKER_04]: up the distillate precursor before it gets
heated up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could the acids used in those scrubs be
causing unwanted titanization during the
[SPEAKER_01]: later distillations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it could really be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're muted, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow you muted yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I muted myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys hear me now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the preponderance of Delta-8 and a lot
of those products leads me to believe
[SPEAKER_04]: that, yeah, there's a lot of acidic scrubs
that basically are converting Delta-9 over
[SPEAKER_04]: to Delta-8 in that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, I can't comment
particularly on a SOP or a process to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that, because we're still working it out
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you that certain things
like Z-like clays and other acidic clays
[SPEAKER_04]: are certainly used as...
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he freeze up?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure he froze up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously what Mark was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark was commenting on what we're seeing
primarily when you're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: isolation of individual cannabinoids has
primarily been done using physics,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing precipitation at cold temperatures
with solvents, primarily done with
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most C1 through C5 alcohols can be
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now, I guess over the last three
years, five years, the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: has really taken off doing fractional
distillation to create those distillates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And distillates are fairly popular within
the vape pen industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that we're really
seeing is that it's a wonderful way to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove all the heavy and light molecular
weight stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously some of those you want to
retain, the terpenes being a broad class
[SPEAKER_01]: of essential oils that many research
papers have shown to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike, do you... Because I've always
noticed this in the distillate world and I
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't got too deep into the world of the
distillates, but I have friends that have
[SPEAKER_05]: like VTA units and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're running through short path
molecular distillation and it's all under
[SPEAKER_05]: a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're decarboxylating prior to
putting it through the unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the terpenes that they had sort of
fractioned off were possibly the worst
[SPEAKER_05]: smelling compounds I've ever smelt in my
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they were just so horrific and bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, is the distillate world not
figuring out to make the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: extract their terpenes first and then run
the material for distillate?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of a lot of what you're
smelling in that distillate is thermally
[SPEAKER_01]: degraded, free fatty acids and essential
oils that as you're exposing those oils to
[SPEAKER_01]: those thermal temperatures in the presence
of oxygen, you're cleaving off carbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are not only... When you're
breaking thermally decomposing,
[SPEAKER_01]: free fatty acids, phospholipids,
et cetera, within the distillation of...
[SPEAKER_01]: Creates undesirable and those artifacts
that are created by that obviously you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to remove that before it goes through
that distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, early on when before everyone was
doing distillation, everyone was just
[SPEAKER_01]: winterizing and putting winterized oil in
vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do that cold temperature
winterization and retain some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that you have the thermal
treatments, you have to separate your
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes before doing that isolation and
then ideally recombining the native
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or introducing engineered terpene ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really taken off in the
fractional distillation and isolation has
[SPEAKER_01]: really taken off in the CBD hemp realm
because a 0.3% flower once you start
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting it may have more than 0.3% of
the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have to take it to that
essentially fractionally distillate sector
[SPEAKER_01]: to essentially remove all the cannabinoids
that can prevent hemp companies from
[SPEAKER_01]: distributing the hemp oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of them have to essentially do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in these bigger states,
there's a bunch of people that obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: your harvests are gonna be... Based on the
weather of the year, you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: trends where forest fires cause crop loss
and farmers don't wanna lose that crop
[SPEAKER_01]: loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wanna try and recover whatever
cannabinoids are there, even though the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes may not be that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can still recoup some of their
loss selling it into the edible market or
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, Michael.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just, you know, again, finishing up
on the point of make your distillate
[SPEAKER_04]: precursor as clean as it can possibly be
because a lot of the things in there
[SPEAKER_04]: degrade to give off flavors and stinky
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Mark, have you ever seen e-cigarettes
doing any... I know that you can see it
[SPEAKER_07]: with nicotine, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, my gosh, don't get me started
on nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nicotine, 60 milligrams is toxic
to the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: The average size adult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you believe that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a 60 milligram dose, it seems like
it's hardly a lot at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when you think about THC and 60
milligrams, 50 milligrams of nicotine is
[SPEAKER_04]: enough, I think, by oral ingestion based
on known toxicity data to kill a human.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, don't they put horses down with pure
nicotine shots?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were these big syringes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, boom, that thing's dead
before the plunger reaches like the
[SPEAKER_05]: halfway point or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's the after nicotine is no
joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine, I don't know like how many
milligrams are in a cigarette,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, compared to how many milligrams
of like THC are in like a joint or like
[SPEAKER_04]: how that compares with one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you were to think that THC
had to talk about the toxicity of
[SPEAKER_04]: nicotine, first of all, we'd probably all
be dead by now as much cannabis that we
[SPEAKER_04]: all smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, I mean, if THC was as deadly
as nicotine, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just like, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicotine set up to do all kinds of toxic
chemistry in your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I always told people that I
wanted to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said, eat a pack of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear you'll never smoke another one
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but you will be sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially after you vomit it all up,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get one stuck in your nose cavity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's hard, especially when you see
people who smoke cigarettes in and around
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis production operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could smell cigarettes and
cigarette breath on people and people who
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke cigarettes smell like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you got to think that
again, the plants could somehow sense
[SPEAKER_04]: that, can't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure always was bothered when people
would smoke cigarettes either in the grow
[SPEAKER_05]: room or outside and then go in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always kind of like, right,
like right at that envelope of that first
[SPEAKER_04]: breath, the fresh air, it's supposed to be
fresh air outside the nicotine and tobacco
[SPEAKER_05]: standing under the intake fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell these people,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: In theory, you can transmit tobacco
viruses to cannabis by now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's sure if you have to handle living
plants, recent dead plants or,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, old cigarettes, but, uh, it has been
shown to be transmitted, but how easily
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more no-no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how many people caused their own
suffering in the grow room by having like
[SPEAKER_05]: very poorly taken care of house plants or
plants around their property that are just
[SPEAKER_05]: suffering with bugs and you know,
mildews and, and then just not putting it
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, dude, you got like a plant in
your living room full of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be the culprit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of the cannabis viruses also
have little or no symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there might be, you know,
10 or 20 viruses that are, have been found
[SPEAKER_09]: in cannabis, but most of them are symptom
free.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only two or three that are really,
really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by symptom three, do you, do you
obviously think that it would probably
[SPEAKER_05]: still affect the plant's ability to
express itself to its maximum potential?
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could tell if you were used to
the variety and you had grown it by the
[SPEAKER_09]: hectare for a decade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or two, and then it had this problem and
you noticed a slight reduction or
[SPEAKER_09]: something.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, by symptom free,
it really means really that it's not
[SPEAKER_09]: causing economic damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I had invited Ian Davidson in today.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was unable to come from Segre
international tissue culture company.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a large scale grower down in
California that grows a substantial amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was really hoping he was going to be
able to come today, but maybe next week
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll get into tissue culture and talk
about the renewed figure that can occur
[SPEAKER_05]: when you can clean up a plant of all of
the fungi, microbials, and pathogens that
[SPEAKER_05]: have impregnated themselves into that
plant over the course of five or 10 or 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years of, you know, cloning it in the,
in the humidity domes, passing it on,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing it in a garage to a bedroom,
to a whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a super interesting
conversation that I'll look forward to
[SPEAKER_05]: having.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's insects that are spreading most of
the problems with viruses with plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are the vectors, the insect vectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the vectors, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking with some people about the seed
companies and how we need tissue cultures
[SPEAKER_10]: and how it's more thriving now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's turning into tissue cultures
because of course less disease,
[SPEAKER_10]: less problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well not too, not too many people
doing it just yet to making it available
[SPEAKER_05]: to most people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think most people are still doing
clones and seeds, but you could definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: see it as when you look at all the
clonally produced plants on the planet
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's been something they've all come
to the conclusion that this will help
[SPEAKER_05]: avoid blood problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the closest industries to cannabis
is the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: All new grape plants are certified virus
free clonally produced.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need a boner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been some interesting research
coming out of California that was looking
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially as cannabis getting affected
by some of the forest fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the competitions I was talking to
one of the organizers about was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to trend where people were
failing for microbial based on where
[SPEAKER_01]: upwind the forest fires were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were discussing whether or
not the forest fires were inadvertently
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading molds and mildews from the old
growth forests through the hills into the
[SPEAKER_01]: roads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, traveling on the smoke, traveling in
the air, being blown?
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores traveling on the ash and the
ash traveling on the wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess even when a forest fire is
occurring, you got to think that all the
[SPEAKER_05]: insects are like buggering off out of
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's probably like this massed
migration of insects traveling away from
[SPEAKER_05]: the heat of the smoke in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Sam said, they're also going to
be carrying pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just after a forest fire, basically
the forest is ready to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically germination and everything is
upregulated in such a way that everything
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of regenerates and takes hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's actually compounds that are
found in the soot that are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: promoters to seed germination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a series of compounds called
butylides, which are naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds that actually they find in the
forest after forest fires that are
[SPEAKER_04]: basically responsible for, again,
the upregulation of now the forestation of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's been recently deforested in a fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's interesting in BC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be elsewhere as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have this plant called fireweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's the first to sort of,
you know, get into the soil after a forest
[SPEAKER_05]: fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's one of the first that shows
up like every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the colonizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of fires in B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: the last few years and in northern B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: here, especially as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And last year was a huge problem for a lot
of growers in the north.
[SPEAKER_08]: Powder mildews and all those types of
things like the the shitty parts of forest
[SPEAKER_08]: fires that come, you know, like yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there was wasn't there that
everybody was the government was putting
[SPEAKER_08]: this out to fuck all your plants up and
all that sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the old days, was there a theory
like that going around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody remember?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so but with with the outbreaks that we
had last summer and I really had to just
[SPEAKER_08]: take whole rooms, empty them, take
everything out of the rooms, new plastic,
[SPEAKER_08]: new poly or new paint, every cord,
every fan blade, everything needed to be
[SPEAKER_08]: sanitized, every single part of the room
inside out underneath on top had to be
[SPEAKER_08]: cleaned thoroughly before we could get rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a lot of fires up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The smokes were smoke was even getting in
the smoke all around us.
[SPEAKER_08]: For fuck's sakes, it was it was harsh.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for two all the way through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_08]: We got all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was heavy, heavy smoke all through the
region.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's hope we don't get too many fires
this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's good to keep smoke away from
your curing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've definitely seen more than a few
hippie jars of cannabis passed over to my
[SPEAKER_05]: nose and been like, were you curing this
near your wood stove?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like were you using a wood stove while
curing this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the herb will just smell like
blanketed with with that smoky sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: cedar type flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: People were using those sulfur burners in
their veg rooms or anywhere in the in the
[SPEAKER_08]: place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're making oil out of their
product in the bug room.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the fuck would we use them?
[SPEAKER_08]: The powder, the sulfur burners like,
yeah, I only had it going on in my
[SPEAKER_08]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I can smell it on this
instantly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't smell the quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smell I smell a match.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble bags turned me on to the powdery
mildew that people were spraying Defender
[SPEAKER_05]: and other of these sulfur burners on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea about it until I started
making bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first time I made bubble with some
some Defender sprayed material,
[SPEAKER_05]: it smelt like a pack of matches being lit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just lit the edge of the hash,
it was super melty and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived two doors down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hopped that piece of hash like almost an
ounce of it off my deck into the forest
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was that ruined.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no saving this product.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's still there, you should go
look for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can make more now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: outside my house with a shovel in the next
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the neighbor's yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think he's joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mushroom ran mushroom patch in that
woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have great mushroom patches in
our woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the scionessence growing quite
prolifically here and around my little
[SPEAKER_05]: village.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're woodchip.
[SPEAKER_05]: From here to like almost to the bridge to
Vancouver, which is most of West
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the boulevards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is woodchip.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the woodchips, of course, are
scionessence friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get some just wonderful mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to be able to pick psychedelic
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still something I quite enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also enjoy picking all kinds of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think chanterelles might be one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoy picking chanterelles
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend locally here who picks all
the edible mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a few of them from morels to
chanterelles and maybe another.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a forager.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes into the he finds all the little
herbs and berries and stuff that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to have them on Hash Church one
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually drew that bubble man picture
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pointillism.
[SPEAKER_05]: 110 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble man sitting on the moon trichome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all dots.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a single line in this
particular picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Shawn Michaels, I'll have to get them
on Hash Church one day and we'll talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about foraging food in the forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of food out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is anyone having issues identifying them
in the field and would a PCR assay help
[SPEAKER_07]: them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys pretty good at identifying
events from others?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned from Paul Stamens.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a wonderful book out there called
my psilocybin mushrooms around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely ways to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a trio of methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the thin layer that's clear that
sits on top of the psilocybin mushroom
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can kind of peel off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's obviously the bluing spores,
putting them on a piece of white paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one to me is like if you've got a
good eyesight and you can see the color
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The poisonous ones like gallerinas,
which are I think some of the most deadly
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a rusty brown spore whereas the
psilocybin has a purple-esque spore.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have them side by side,
they're very, very easy to distinguish the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference in the two of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then of course the bruising on the
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gallerina doesn't bruise at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the psilocybin will most
assuredly, unless you pick them and put
[SPEAKER_05]: them right into your mouth, if you're
picking them to collect them to dry them,
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll have blued wherever you pick them
from, wherever you touch them from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, even of the low psilocybin
content ones, like stunsies, they still do
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The higher psilocybin content ones like
azorescens and cyanescens, these ones blue
[SPEAKER_05]: greatly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know of any other variety of
mushroom that looks anything like
[SPEAKER_09]: psilocybin, the blues.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, if you had a genetic test for the
psilocin synthase, the precursor synthase,
[SPEAKER_01]: because then people who are in the field
can do tests to see if they're potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: new or novel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably do, actually,
in the field, RNA tests on that to
[SPEAKER_07]: actually look at RNA levels of that gene
because there can be ... mushroom to
[SPEAKER_07]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are really potent and some aren't.
[SPEAKER_07]: The genetic ones are really easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could actually target that gene and
look for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'd probably want to go after
the RNA just so you could see if it's ...
[SPEAKER_07]: information in terms of not only is it
cubensis, but how much is it making?
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't be as good as measuring the
compound, but it's a little bit harder to
[SPEAKER_07]: bring the analog equipment into the field
to test for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: The RNA would hopefully be a proxy to how
much it's ... into yeast or piscia really
[SPEAKER_07]: soon because they've mapped it all out
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They could theoretically brew this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be really wild, I think,
because it's probably a very friendly
[SPEAKER_07]: pathway to ... I bet the codon structure
is the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it would pour it real easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your next beer is going to be a boomer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain the difference between RNA to DNA
to these people who don't know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to imagine DNA is like your hard
drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: All your programs are on there,
but if you're having to be running one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the programs excessively, you might see it
in your task manager as taking up all your
[SPEAKER_07]: CPU.
[SPEAKER_07]: RNA is a more ... is which programs on the
genome are actually getting expressed or
[SPEAKER_07]: getting run.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you measure RNA loads, you get a
little bit more information about how
[SPEAKER_07]: actively expressed is this gene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it completely ... making probably any
compound or are the RNA levels through the
[SPEAKER_07]: roof?
[SPEAKER_07]: In which case, it may be, in fact,
making ... it may be much higher percent
[SPEAKER_07]: expressed compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That definitely is a good metaphor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The challenge with RNA is ... yeah,
it's a little ... it's designed to be
[SPEAKER_07]: ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's designed to break down quickly
because you want these programs to get run
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the molecule to get eaten up
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't ... tissue and bring it to a
lab with an RNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be asking a lot of
questions about how to store it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you put it on dry ice and how cold was
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the RNA is a ticking time bomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make sure we're reading
something as close to ... question that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're trying to ... was shipped in FedEx
and heated up to 50 degrees on a loading
[SPEAKER_07]: dock.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll probably destroy all the RNA or at
least degrade it a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important, if you want to do RNA
stuff, to have tools that can go ...
[SPEAKER_07]: because they are not having those
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: For certain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we lost Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's off for the day and I think we might
have lost Indra too.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he was off to the Santa Rosa High
Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally thought when he texted me that
I was like, wow, they're still throwing
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of focus and time and energy that
people put into cannabis cups to sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: build that brand, to build that name.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always apparently for the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you high times probably hire some
patients to do judging though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that would probably be a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that they do if they don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these cups, if it's all for the
patients, might as well get them to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: judges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then at least in the least they get access
to the medicine after it's been tested and
[SPEAKER_05]: proven clean, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had invited Alec from SC Labs in today,
but he was also busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll get him in next week to
share in the conversation with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always good for some good convo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys at SC Labs, they're doing some
good things down in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think they do most of the testing
for the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do a huge bunch of testing done in a
very short period of time that a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people's livelihoods are connected to the
results of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they're choosing to,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're choosing to make that their
platform to create their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas surely you could create a
livelihood without the high times cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be able to be possible is all
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of it is just the pride of
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think ego is a big part of it for sure,
but I think it's definitely connected to
[SPEAKER_05]: monetary gain as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I'm judging those two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have egos and we all want to make
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been into it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cool thing, Mark, and you know this
because we know the same people.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like Cuban and Jibs are the nicest
people in the world and you could totally
[SPEAKER_04]: approach them at these events.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be well known or well
respected.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just be some kid who's really
just watched some YouTube videos or just
[SPEAKER_04]: heard about these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can totally walk up and shake
their hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always I always like that about the Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went since 95 and although I very rarely
like the only part of it that left a bad
[SPEAKER_05]: taste in my mouth was like the competition
part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it was always seemed so cheesy and
it was just like compared to the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: Cup, which was like this is an awesome
area for people to come and meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also way before the you know the
Internet where you could just kind of get
[SPEAKER_05]: in touch with any of these people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if you wanted to just via Instagram or
Twitter or Facebook or YouTube in the
[SPEAKER_05]: comments section, but this was before all
that where literally you literally had to
[SPEAKER_05]: fly to Amsterdam because that was the only
place it was happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where everyone sort of it was a
magical time the mid 90s to the to the
[SPEAKER_05]: late 90s in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure prior to that, you know,
I'm sure Sam has some unique stories as he
[SPEAKER_05]: saw it all unfolding and happening there
as he was one of the huge catalysts and
[SPEAKER_05]: sparks in in in making it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's a coincidence Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and I did win the first high times
Canada's Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember it was mine and Rob's idea
which we shared with Steve Haggard.
[SPEAKER_09]: They created the first high times Canada's
Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know a lot of people have a lot of
you know complaints about the Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the bottom line is I think it did help
Canada in many different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you know they were just the
playboy centerfold equivalent of I mean
[SPEAKER_09]: High Times magazine was you know pop or
porn, you know, but I still all in all
[SPEAKER_09]: really enjoyed myself with those things
because I met so many interesting people
[SPEAKER_09]: who really loved Canada seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the most interesting thing was
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's where I met you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think it goes back to what I
was saying about just to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: approach someone that you may only know
from watching their internet video and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, wow, that's Cuban grower over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks just the same like he does on his
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just walk right up and say hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those types of interactions and yeah,
I've met certainly I met a bunch of folks
[SPEAKER_04]: last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really surprised at the Emerald Cup
at the amount of product that actually is
[SPEAKER_04]: transacted at that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting because it seems like a
lot of growers from the Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California area actually, you know barter
trades with whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's just huge amounts huge sacks of
weed being, you know, taken back and forth
[SPEAKER_04]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one of the issues with the cup has
perennially been where do people consume?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the safe consumption areas and
where can people consume because you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a special bracelet to get in there
and the municipality wherever you're
[SPEAKER_04]: having it, whether it's in San Bernardino
or Santa Rosa, which always seems to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: really cool venue for at the county
fairgrounds there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to really have it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to several cups there,
but tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, I think the real
differentiator is not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_04]: event itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the people that show up and the
interaction that you have with the people
[SPEAKER_04]: that go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's for the people for the people
by the people weed the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to check out the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a pretty good event.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of good folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just one of these days I'll get off my
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your status on being able to come
down south?
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably get my waiver now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all pardoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: My record is pardoned in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a whole folder full of my waivers
and not to draw the conversation into
[SPEAKER_05]: politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from someone who paid very little
attention to politics, it just seemed like
[SPEAKER_05]: it was safer under the last regime to
travel down to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: than it potentially is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, especially with now now, I guess,
Trudeau, those fired back with some
[SPEAKER_05]: tariffs on U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: products since Trump did it to us for,
I think, our steel or bubble bags under
[SPEAKER_04]: tariffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, like what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bubble bags under tariff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're like they cost nine hundred
dollars a set now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get and I get two hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a nine to five a Walmart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hey, I'm paying two bucks a liter
for gas right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's the world is a crazy place
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we paid five five euros per what per
liter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe it's only three seventy or
something, but it's it's crazy,
[SPEAKER_09]: more expensive than what you pay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I believe that because I remember
being in Paris in the late 80s in like 89
[SPEAKER_05]: and thinking, wow, gas was like I think it
was between a dollar and two dollars a
[SPEAKER_05]: liter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It cost my friend's dad so much money to
fill up his Mercedes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like from from my perspective,
because back in the 80s here, gas was just
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: A full tank of gas certainly wasn't like
90 to one hundred dollars, whereas now
[SPEAKER_05]: it's more like two hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what getting old is all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can complain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when the bus cost a nickel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when they used to pay you to
get on the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you were probably on large jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was called jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the that's the punch line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to feel so much pain all the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Constantly, you know, all the numbspots on
your body from all the different breaks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, dude, you broke like every bone in
your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's that's for me before eight this
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the things that I just I can't believe
that I'm sore where I am still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, dude, didn't you like dislocate both
your legs when you crashed your
[SPEAKER_05]: motorcycle?
[SPEAKER_08]: Both legs, both shoulders, broken neck on
that one and broken wrist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You must just you must have been like a
floppy doll just laying there unable to
[SPEAKER_05]: move.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually tried to sit up because it
knocked the wind out of me, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a buddy was behind me in his truck and
he got out and he just made it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just kept me down.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just don't sit down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to get up because the wind
was knocked out of me when I was boxing in
[SPEAKER_08]: my young days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I got the wind knocked out of me,
my boxing coach would take my arms and go
[SPEAKER_08]: up and down and would exercise your lungs
to get your air in there quicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I did is I went to lift my arms
to start doing the movement to get my
[SPEAKER_08]: lungs moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my arms were just like just my whole
it just screamed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything screamed in my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was I wasn't able to do that part.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's some evil, Knievel shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I was I was doing so much
painkillers and all that back then that it
[SPEAKER_08]: was literally the painkillers didn't do
nothing to get up into a sitting position
[SPEAKER_08]: into my bed on the side of it was the most
excruciating thing I could ever do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I would just basically sniff a
nice little line of fucking heroin because
[SPEAKER_08]: that would knock me out for the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did that for what?
[SPEAKER_08]: A week.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get rid of the pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I love my coconut oil, tinctures,
moonshine tincture with the OG Kush and
[SPEAKER_08]: all that works really good when it comes
down to pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it won't kill you.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it won't.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all the time either.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't do every all the other shit that
painkillers do to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hillary just testified in to the Senate
here in Canada, which she talked about a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit on the last episode of Fast
Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure of how many of you guys
watched her seven minute splur.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she she mentioned in that about the
brain stem and how that's one of the only
[SPEAKER_05]: places where the cannabinoid receptors
aren't really in this concentrated amount,
[SPEAKER_05]: whereas there is a lot of opioid
receptors, which is why, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: fentanyl and heroin and OxyContin can kill
you because too many, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it controls your your breathing and your
your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was pretty interesting concept of
why cannabinoids don't have that ability
[SPEAKER_05]: to slow your breath down to the point
where you're you're dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas I could definitely say after
seeing Breeder Steve eat almost 15 grams
[SPEAKER_05]: of dry sift in a in a tray of brownies,
it's actually 30 grams of dry sift in the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole tray.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he shared it with his buddy,
Wayne.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, he was out for 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember his wife like trying to
listen for his breath because he was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you could have operated on him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was that out on edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, like it was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, and how long do you wait?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're like, OK, I know cannabis
can't kill you, but he hasn't moved in 34
[SPEAKER_05]: hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is beyond the sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some next level shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put the mirror under the nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is no joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, true story program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could hit a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm kind of digging these two
hour hash churches.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been pumping it out for a couple
of hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might do a bong rip and call it a day
unless anyone has something in particular
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to cover or get into.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke a little full mount hash here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad Indra dropped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask him about his extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people ask me about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anything that's going on
lately, Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he keeps me updated all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would definitely let him share all
about it next week when he comes on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's definitely he's he's built units.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got units built and they're looking
pretty shiny and new and they're looking
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I obviously am not a solvent extractor,
but I'm sure once they get out to a group
[SPEAKER_05]: of different people, people will be able
to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always really the tried and true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I know that Todd McCormick
always doubted everything Indra said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, you know, just they would get into
it really harshly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me before I met Indra,
online when I'm through meeting him
[SPEAKER_05]: online, before I saw him face to face,
you know, the reason why I had belief in
[SPEAKER_05]: what he was doing was because of the
defatted hemp seed oil that he sent me in
[SPEAKER_05]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I had it tested in three
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told the story many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the protein powder isolate was like 10
to 12 percent higher than the company that
[SPEAKER_05]: was claiming they had the highest protein
powder isolate in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never seen seed embryos intact as he
had defatted them without actually
[SPEAKER_05]: affecting their structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't like a seed cake like pressed
cold pressed misnomer thing where they're
[SPEAKER_05]: heating it up and they're pressing it and
they're bouncing that cake on screens and
[SPEAKER_05]: collecting the protein powder isolate that
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: His was just like whole embryos.
[SPEAKER_05]: It blew me away having been invested and
involved in the hemp industry since,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: His oil was as gold as gold could be,
which I had only seen when people ran
[SPEAKER_05]: through activated charcoal to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That green color that you get from the
cold pressed oil from chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: His oil was the goldest I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unbelievably tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stayed like it didn't go bad on the
shelf for like an insanely long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those all those things combined had
me thinking that that Indra is the real
[SPEAKER_05]: deal, that if he could do that to hemp
seed embryos, then he should be able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that to all sorts of oil and fat
containing seeds and resin type producing
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to have that bong rip now,
Dee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know that, you know, again,
my client and friend, Dan, who watches
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash Church, was the first group to get
the extractor and they actually couldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: use it as is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it was like before it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they got the old extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was full.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like full.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't fully certified or whatever,
ratified or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't ready for prime time yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a pre-production prototype,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they ended up having to switch out
their extractor and they're using a
[SPEAKER_04]: different one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know where Danny's extractor
is, if that's being, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Indra has been really nice to
keep me informed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I probably get the same text that
you get, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of different pictures of a shiny,
big extractor in the factory and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know if any of them are
actually out there in use and it'd be
[SPEAKER_04]: great to get an update from John and see
where things are on that because.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, he'll come update us next
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome that he can give that update
too, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of people ask me about it
all the time and I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, well, I know the one didn't work
out for Danny and those guys at Carrova,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that doesn't mean that the other ones
are not working and out there today
[SPEAKER_04]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know if they are or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll get him to come and give us an
update.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there was like a lot of,
you know, talk back and forth and there
[SPEAKER_04]: was a picture of a extractor that had
imploded and some people thought it was
[SPEAKER_04]: Indra's extractor, but then Indra kind of
fought back and said, no, that's not my
[SPEAKER_04]: extractor and you guys are all a bunch of
dumb shits.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like Indra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nicest sort of approach sometimes on
Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've felt the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told him many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to pull back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes time to learn about how to be on
the Internet sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had a few friends over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: My one friend who I won't even mention his
name because I don't want to call him out,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he's just like the nicest person in
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I invited him onto my website
years ago and he just was like this troll
[SPEAKER_05]: that was just attacking everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, dude, like, I don't even
know if I can follow you anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were just like trolling
incessantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird because that's not who you
are in real life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess it goes back to, you know,
like South Park episode where where Stan's
[SPEAKER_05]: dad becomes the ultra troll.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys remember that episode where
and people like, oh, he must be the most
[SPEAKER_05]: miserable man in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they show him like skipping down
the road, like he's just as happy as happy
[SPEAKER_05]: can be, I guess, because he gets all his
aggression and troll trolling out in the
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Internet world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless, made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't seen that South Park
episode, check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a couple of episodes,
I believe, where he's the Internet troll.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an interesting group called the
Pineapple Fund that has been crypto
[SPEAKER_07]: funding a bunch of different projects,
and they raised it for maps to get MDMA
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe even psilocybin through the FDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones that raise that money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they raised it for maps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a bit of a I think there was a
matching fund.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ended up being like an eight million
dollar fund, which I think you can see in
[SPEAKER_07]: this link on the I put on the chat room
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that and they're estimating that might
be enough to actually bring it through the
[SPEAKER_07]: phase three study.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of curious where this is going
to go just because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I'm not really well read on the
patent background of that molecule.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a pretty old one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So imagine if there were any patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's open art, open art.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the full safety profile
already developed on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like something that they'd have to
like, do a not an orphan drug thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's a way of reapplying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already in the so called the Orange
Book.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Orange Book is basically the book of
active ingredients that already have FDA
[SPEAKER_04]: approval from which you can draw from to
make commercial medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in sort of the generic bucket,
really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of its scheduling with the DA.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I bet it's a lower schedule than
cannabis right now, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scheduled to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be a licensed pharmaceutical
manufacturer with a schedule to license to
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like fucking Ritalin and Adderall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of amphetamines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the diet of people these
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought maps owned M.D.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: or M.M.D.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Celsius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shasta Shulkin was the one who discovered
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we discovered a patent for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was discovered a real long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did he do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Rediscover it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he he found the application for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was an application.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think when it was first discovered,
Mark, it was discovered as a racemic
[SPEAKER_04]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both the right hand and left hand
version Shulkin actually made the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, took and separated the right
from the left hand versions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, composition of matter was
already known.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these were just application,
you know, utility patents on the utility
[SPEAKER_04]: of these molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also claim a myriad of analogs
around them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not just the active compounds
themselves, but then what they'll do is
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll claim, say, like there's a methyl
group in the four position.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they'll claim an ethyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll also claim a propyl group and a
butyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they'll blow it out to any group
that can possibly exist there that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can make synthetically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, one of, you know,
Shulkin's obvious, you know, sort of claim
[SPEAKER_04]: the famous was all of the analogs in work
that he did around those nucleus.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those compounds were made by a
very sort of routine synthesis where he
[SPEAKER_04]: just started with a different starting
material and ended up with a different
[SPEAKER_04]: product because of the starting material
at a different group there and would bring
[SPEAKER_04]: it through the same synthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the great, obviously,
Shulkin would actually take it with his
[SPEAKER_04]: wife and write down comments in a diary
and let everyone know what kind of affects
[SPEAKER_04]: these different substituents would have
and really develop his own structure
[SPEAKER_04]: activity relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do that anymore.
Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: we have been dabbling in the same field
and we recently got a grant from a crypto
[SPEAKER_07]: currency called Dash that is going to fund
a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be the next five months or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be performing that work and putting
all the public.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dash is doing this because they are
trying to get into the cannabis banking
[SPEAKER_07]: industry because it feels kind of missed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Transaction time at Bitcoin is like 10
minutes, so it doesn't really work into
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dash has these sub-second transaction
speeds that can probably work point of
[SPEAKER_07]: sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to be funding and people
have a crypto track there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So folks can go and learn more about how
that currency can potentially help the
[SPEAKER_07]: banking problems we've got down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the banking problems easier up in
Canada now that you guys are all... I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still hasn't opened up completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the largest banks like the Royal
Bank of Canada has an intimate American
[SPEAKER_05]: banking relationship, so they have stayed
away from it completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Banco Montreal had also been
staying away from it until recently where
[SPEAKER_05]: they just released a bunch of funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're opening up their doors now to
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe TD Bank does it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I say cannabis business,
it's really like federally legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the dispensaries and people that
are more in the gray market are not as
[SPEAKER_05]: confident.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of want to be careful how you
approach banking if you have like a
[SPEAKER_05]: product that is basically a cannabis-based
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I myself have had Royal Bank after 24
years just close all my accounts because
[SPEAKER_05]: they found out after 19 years of those 24
years that I was doing business with a
[SPEAKER_05]: product that people were using with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just that alone was enough for them to
close all my bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they did the same thing to Jody
Emery and many, many others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some people go with credit unions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people go with TD, I guess Banco
Montreal now, but it still hasn't quite
[SPEAKER_05]: opened up to the point where you could
choose the bank you want to choose to use
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have a cannabis-based business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's federal, but there's still that
little bit of fear coming from the
[SPEAKER_05]: American side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure if we looked into how much of the
money in Canada that's being invested in
[SPEAKER_05]: our licensed production facilities,
I bet you it would be well over 50% of
[SPEAKER_05]: American money because I mean,
we all know America is the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although on a world scale, there's a big
world out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initially, America seemed to be the strong
cannabis marketplace, in my opinion at
[SPEAKER_05]: least anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that Canada being positioned the
way they are right now, having been
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in this industry for the last 10
years or whatever, they've jumped the gun
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit to companies that might come
behind them in a federally legal way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the most important part of the
licensing here in Canada that I see the
[SPEAKER_05]: LPs appreciating is that they have export
licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Canada is a small marketplace with 35
million.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of the world is a lot bigger with
billions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So being able to ship to countries with
reciprocity laws that allow for cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: to exist as a medicine seems like a pretty
high value for those license holders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they have to get money transmitter
licenses in every state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to drop in ETMs at various
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's starting in Arizona and then
going to California and Vegas after that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there'll be more in that in a few
months as it rolls out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is crazy how far the pushback has gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, when I saw hemp getting grown in
Canada, I thought, oh, well, this is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden medical licensing
and everything seemed to be moving along,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're just holding the doors closed
for as long as they can humanly possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: hold those doors closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the doors I'm speaking of
metaphorically are opening up federal law
[SPEAKER_05]: with basically tax and banking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get those two things because
without banking and tax, what you end up
[SPEAKER_05]: getting is money laundering and tax
evasion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those are big crimes that they can
hit you with that for me would be a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit scary doing business in a place that
didn't have federal exemptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're making some progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, our employees right now are being
paid by direct deposit directly at the
[SPEAKER_04]: checking accounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get an electric or electron.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a notification by email that
they've been paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seek and see a PDF of their their pay
stub and how much in taxes they're paying
[SPEAKER_04]: and other benefits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is becoming more normalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it needs to go a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Further, because, again, we don't enjoy
all of the financial tools that a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: other industries have for no reason
whatsoever, other than we're what dealing
[SPEAKER_04]: with a schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know the picks and shovels
argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, I find it interesting with
you, Mark, because you're really a picks
[SPEAKER_04]: and shovels person.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're not growing or selling
the plant for profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're selling a pick and a shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's completely you know what someone
does with your product is what someone
[SPEAKER_04]: does with your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a connection that has to be made
again in a decision somewhere in a bank
[SPEAKER_04]: office, probably in some high rise that,
oh, we need to not allow this interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: when what you're selling is totally legal
and breaks no law and has no direct impact
[SPEAKER_04]: on something that's being sold,
that's underneath some antiquated drug
[SPEAKER_04]: law.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to take it a step further,
I'm also federally exempt by my government
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to grow and process and extract
resins from cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if you were to use the argument,
well, we saw the videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's totally promoting people to,
you know, make hash with these bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a license to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why shouldn't I be able to show other
people who may or may not have licenses?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the licensed police.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't have to check the people who
are watching my videos to see if they have
[SPEAKER_05]: an element that allows them to be exempt
by their government for cannabis to use
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just sort of all makes no sense to
me when the banks just decided to cut me
[SPEAKER_05]: off like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get off here in a few minutes,
but I wanted to throw out two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is normalizing, something that
Mark said.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's happening at a
local level here in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're in a rural area,
is normalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis for years, people had to hide
what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that it's becoming legal,
that's part of the evolution, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of normalizing is like this
concept that's coming Monday, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: invited to tell the local Rotary Club,
which is a conservative business
[SPEAKER_00]: organization in local towns, our local
Rotary Club wants to hear how to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do a 20-minute
presentation on how to care for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the local sheriff is a member of that
club, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun to see if he shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the ways that people,
I want to encourage everybody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to normalize your work,
normalize who you are, help people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that cannabis is not about
criminal behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about all kinds of different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of them and all of you are one
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to say is vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how to change the banking laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how to change the whole
prohibitionist mindset that's shaped law
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis for so many years,
is people need to get involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell anybody how to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if enough people show up, we can
change the situation that's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States and California at the
moment in a positive way, is my belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all of you for what
you offer to my understanding of how this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant works in my life and in the people
who are listening and the people I know
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sacred work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who's listening, this is sacred
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the invite, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to all of you, thank you for the
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to sign off at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks for coming out, Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do appreciate your time and your
energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, if you're going to vote,
also, you should eat heroic doses of
[SPEAKER_05]: psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not every day, but definitely every once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every once in a while, you should just
crush your own ego and go and learn some
[SPEAKER_05]: important things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to tell you how to trip,
but I am going to tell you, you should
[SPEAKER_05]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: True that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of voting, there's another
form of voting going on in the world right
[SPEAKER_07]: now that I think is worth talking about
because I'm not in good states federally
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't feel like it's really
representative of the people anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: But local voting, you can make a lot of
impact.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there was actually a local vote
that was utilized to fund this candidacy
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Dash cryptocurrency was forked off
of Bitcoin like in 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been growing faster than Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one difference it has is the
capacity for the people who have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: stake or a lot of a lot of coins in this
ecosystem, they have the power to vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of giving all of the mining
rewards to people who do mining like they
[SPEAKER_07]: do in Bitcoin, they actually take 10
percent of that money and put it into a
[SPEAKER_07]: treasury and let another group of people
who can prove they have at least X amount
[SPEAKER_07]: of coins how to spend that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a bunch of people submit applications
on, hey, what if we use the currency for
[SPEAKER_07]: this XRZ thing, the group votes every
month and what to fund.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they dole money out of every 30 days
based on how the network votes on what to
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you do the math, there's actually
more representation in the cryptocurrency
[SPEAKER_07]: than there is in our U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: government in terms of per capita people
to representative ratios.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think it's an interesting new
model on how we spend this cryptocurrency
[SPEAKER_07]: fountain that's out there as opposed to
how we spend the Federal Reserve fountain
[SPEAKER_07]: of money that's pumping out dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, one after another.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, my my cryptocurrency pitch,
I'll just leave it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for sharing, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked into cryptocurrency over the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend just recently got rid of all his
pot coins that he had.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what they ended up
turning into bitcoins or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he ended up getting a substantial
amount of money back from those things
[SPEAKER_05]: from years ago when he first turned me on
to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, oh, you got to check out this
pot coin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Another another cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: When they make it even more accessible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've got the cryptocurrency
wallets with the large statements that
[SPEAKER_05]: need to be made to open the wallet and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's just not as you know,
when I can just tap on the machine when
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at the grocery store or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to work with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When that when that happens and there's
more just someone's going to figure
[SPEAKER_05]: something out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just started watching a show the other
day that is hilarious that I could see
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe them doing the cryptocurrency
version of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Silicon Valley, I'd never seen that
show before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah, there's they have they
have a bit of an issue or something that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're trying to start out of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the same one Guilfoy is in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like the show is basically
about it's like a comedy that he's got.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy accidentally creates a lot an
algorithm that compresses anything at
[SPEAKER_05]: lossless like there's no loss in the
compression.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but he doesn't really know what he's
got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the shows on HBO, I think it
fucking made me laugh so hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at a friend's house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have cable TV, TV for that matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll download shows every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just seeing this show was very funny
and just how these things happen and how
[SPEAKER_05]: people try to take advantage of them and
how sometimes things are just accidentally
[SPEAKER_05]: created for a platform that, you know,
it was never really intended for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, someone does that the same way
BitTorrent opened up, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: downloading that game changer from from
downloading the way we were accessing
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: When BitTorrent came out, it changed
everything and made made it so much easier
[SPEAKER_05]: to download information.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it's refreshing that we're
seeing these tools being used to fund
[SPEAKER_07]: things that our governments won't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess at that point, it's is it just
like a super secret group that people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know anything about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't really have any idea where
that money's coming from, or it's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like they're a little bit more transparent
and they kind of let you know who they
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's all on a block chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that block chain is basically just
when it mints money every month,
[SPEAKER_07]: it happens to mint a treasury.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the case of Dash, it's like six
thousand one hundred dash or something
[SPEAKER_07]: every month that gets voted on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's getting literally minted right
off the block chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just they're just voters that are
involved in deciding which direction and
[SPEAKER_07]: which addresses it goes to.
[SPEAKER_07]: A taxable entity that's issuing those.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the masternode folks, some are some
are known and some are anonymous.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the people doing the voting,
you don't always know who they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: That can be difficult when you submit a
proposal to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know your audience,
it's hard for that application.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ours is pretty dense about sequencing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think a lot of people there fully
understood the care to understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: details.
[SPEAKER_07]: All they really wanted to see was that how
can you demonstrate this will improve the
[SPEAKER_07]: transaction rate of Dash?
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're doing something on this review
that's all done on crypto, or it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: the bounties for peer review are put out
for researchers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We pay the researchers to do the reviews
and they bypass the journals and just put
[SPEAKER_07]: the reviews directly online.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that keeps it so that the genome breed
without having any journal have an
[SPEAKER_07]: ownership over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a different way to do peer
review.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do the numbers on how much peer
review gets done, it's like it's a 20
[SPEAKER_07]: billion dollar a year market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's a bunch of money being
pumped.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, half the papers can't be
reproduced.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how it's disruptive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to cut some got to cut some people out
of the out of the mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I think the Congress are
creating more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're they're effectively they
don't pay the reviewers anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're they're dependent on reviewers
doing stuff for them for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: They charge three grand usually and about
if you if it is behind a paywall.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's there's a host of bad actors
that that you know, this is a result of an
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron Swartz committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just a host of copyright trolling
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been very destructive, I think,
disruptive to the economy and to just the
[SPEAKER_07]: progress in mankind that if we can free
scientific literature from being embedded
[SPEAKER_07]: in that mesh, I think it's a it's a big
step forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's cool that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it fails and morphs into the next
thing that will succeed or maybe it just
[SPEAKER_05]: succeeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guys, 500 viewers still in the room
checking us out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've been going for a couple of
two and a half hours and I'm pretty good
[SPEAKER_05]: to go and kind of go and enjoy my Sunday
now that we've had a good hash church and
[SPEAKER_05]: a conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mark holding it down for almost a full
hour, giving us a breakdown on
[SPEAKER_05]: hydrogenated cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do appreciate you for coming in and
sharing your time with us and Kevin and
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade and Johnny B and D420K and Skunkman
Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Indra in for a short period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys all for coming in and
talking about interesting things on a
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday afternoon with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the audience does as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So feel free to say goodbye, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
Peace out.
Peace out.
