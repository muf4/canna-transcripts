[SPEAKER_00]: We did it!
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it, everyone!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always so nervous, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough making this shit work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everybody, to Bubble Man's world,
and the, oh, the wake and bake episode 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope we're all doing well today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a few little things from the Karma Cup
that I'm gonna be giving away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pin, and some Terp proof, and a little
Karma Cup silicon pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure how I'm gonna go about giving
that away, but I am gonna be giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see it happening in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're going live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything is on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah, that looks good,
that looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sit over a little bit over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's having a great effin'
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a few dabs here, gonna do a little
Terp dips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to announce right away to the
Canadians in the room that Blue River
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has another discount on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got turned off for June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did shave, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new discount is all lowercase
letters, Blue River, one word,
[SPEAKER_00]: B-L-U-E-R-I-V-E-R, 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Blue River 2017 code is gonna get
you 30% off your order, so about 50 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: off each vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my Karma Cup shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured I'd wear one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got people dabbin' on the back,
so you gotta love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I would recommend these for any type
of light that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have special LED ones, they have
special MHS ones, metal halides,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have HPS ones that are right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have ones for the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this company is called Method Seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their logo, their motto, if you will,
is don't grow blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that motto, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're gonna do a Terp dip here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off this day parapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little sweet skunk, got a little
Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, this shit is like glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you almost have to heat up the
dabber to be able to get a hit like this
[SPEAKER_00]: proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna have to melt it so I can get the
Terp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna go in for some Covello
Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, she was loving, loving the Green
Dragon OG brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was lovin' it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Sarah, Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are gonna talk a little bit about
the Karma Cup today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to her the other day and she
asked if I could maybe share a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of pertinent information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to be a celebrity judge for
solventless, for the hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you wanna have me testing your
hash, smoking your hash, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: wanna get in touch with thekarmacup.com
and you're gonna wanna do it before July
[SPEAKER_00]: 28th because July 28th is the cutoff date
that you need to have the product in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty important, July 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, she's got all sorts of
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got fuckin' pen categories and
solventless categories and solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, bud categories, so much,
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Cane, I think wholesale it's worth
about 50,000 plus US dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think retail, considering they did a
piece with Mothership that was very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar that retailed for 125,000 US
dollars, I think that cup's worth at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 US dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit insane to think that
I was balancing it in the palm of my hand
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 stories above the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I turned around and the owner of the
pipe was inside the apartment,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was clutching the Pelican case and
clenching his teeth and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I have never been so nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey man, you know, I'm good for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna break your glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I did, I'd pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, don't fuck around with people's
glass if you can't pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause geez, Louise, that's, yeah,
that's, well, it's not quite a Lambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Lambo here is about 300 plus K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending, most people are buying the
Gallardos and the upper levels of Lambos,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for 150 or 125, you might get like
a nice Audi or a decent, not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercedes, but a decent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy how much people pay for fuckin'
cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy for how much people are payin' for
fuckin' pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, if you've got the money,
you've got the ability, don't get down on
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are doin' that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would love to see people who
are buyin' $125,000 pipes also take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of people in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that they're helping feed people
and helping clothe and house people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, to each their own, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all allowed to buy the things that
we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sometimes think that there should
be a humility involved that when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself something on that level,
that you might wanna be taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta pay to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, DB Cooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this up, shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a cheap Mercedes for 6K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it only 120K in Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: That surprises me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really surprises me, because we have
a local club here, and you can't get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it without a $250,000 car, and there's
quite a few Lambos in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you
guys are talkin' base models, and these
[SPEAKER_00]: kids that are buying these Lambos and
these Ferraris and these Bugattis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're paying high dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not paying $125,000 for a Lambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sayin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to the dispensaries too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're kind of on par.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think butane oil sells a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, an F-150, there you go,
and that's a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a guy that just paid 75 grand for
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're talkin' 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit more accurate,
because there's no way people are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambos for 150 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's clean this minor Chaz
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like to hit it a little warmer
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Terp Dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, when you hit it with the Terps,
the taste is so fucking on point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're burnin' my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put so much in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when it comes out, it steams
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn your shit if you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get this Chaz off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I gotta go in a little harder,
especially if I hit it a tiny little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go in with my little dabber and I'll
just sort of remove the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: part that's just not coming off nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just heat it up a little bit
more and go in with the DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, I've given this tip a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you might want to,
try not to move the Q-tip around too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it just sit on the Chaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it'll do is if you just let it
sit there, it'll pick it up even easier
[SPEAKER_00]: than it would if you try to do this
intuitive sort of scrappy, scrappy,
[SPEAKER_00]: scrappy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously at one point you're
gonna have to scrape a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, you shouldn't have
to too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, gettin' her off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels good to clean the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels good to clean the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit harder on this one than last,
but nonetheless, I do believe it's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: for another rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That DC glass cleaner is made from this
sort of oil, naranja, is that what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Karanja, karanja oil, processed coconut
extract, processed kelp extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: and processed extract or sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that want to ask the
question in the future, you can go to DC
[SPEAKER_00]: glass cleaner's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know it, but if you punch it into
Google, just the same way you would ask a
[SPEAKER_00]: person, what is DC glass cleaner made of
or where can I buy it and what not,
[SPEAKER_00]: Google will give you the proper answer
each and every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tip, savin' live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Savin' DC glass courts, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to give a shout out to my bro,
Head Stash, who's local here in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes these medicated lollipops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are artisan lollipops, and this
one's got some root burr.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the root burr, and it is 100
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad, not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably get into that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random lollipop, just had it sitting here
on the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and bought all this stash recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Heavenly Days guys and the
gentleman who brokers for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has his own company, and he sells
these, so how about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those fly hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'll do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get in touch with Adam, and I'll see
if he can't send me a couple of these hats
[SPEAKER_00]: for giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a loyal wearer of this hat
since, well, since the day he sent me the
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big squirrel nuts, don't fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I'm reactive sometimes,
and I don't mean to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have noticed this
yet, but I am a fairly intense person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spent any amount of time with me,
sure, we could get bubbled up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd be pretty relaxed and pretty
baked, but after a couple hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be like, this motherfucker is
intense, and I'm not talking about intense
[SPEAKER_00]: camping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about intense energy flowing
outward off of me in all directions at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are kind of enamored with it at
first, but it sort of gets annoying after
[SPEAKER_00]: a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just being honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a new joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I told the horrible, horrible,
horrible rabbi joke already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I tell the rabbi and the priest joke?
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of the only jokes I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrible joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not a good joke,
but I'll say it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's derogatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It insults Jews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It insults Christians, and I'm friends
with Christians and Jews, and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing against either of them,
but I will tell the joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joke goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rabbi and a priest are walking down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk by a park and see some boys
playing soccer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The priest says, hey, let's go fuck those
little boys, and the rabbi says,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: All my fucking Christian friends and
Jewish friends are gonna be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really fucking mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a joke, but it certainly doesn't have
any malicious intent, and for all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Hebrew brethren and sister apologies,
for my Christian brethren and sister
[SPEAKER_00]: apologies, I know it's just a few bad
apples in the bunch creating stereotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hey, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it made you laugh, then fucking A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you laughed because it was funny,
good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you laughed because you are a hateful,
mean, vengeful, person who dislikes
[SPEAKER_00]: certain groups of people, then shame on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of like with Dave
Chappelle on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chappelle said years ago, look,
bro, I will say anything for a laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and George Carlin has a couple
of things that are just really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: His comedy talking about certain things
that can be funny that at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even in this time still to this day,
people are like, there's nothing funny
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comedian can make something funny about
anything as long as you take the hate,
[SPEAKER_00]: the anger, the derogatory, the,
you know, and make it a positive sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like perspective where you're looking at
it and kind of like, ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Carlin, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't even hate everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I love everybody the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips for starting a terpene business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dude, honestly, just do what
everyone does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy Blue River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the same containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the same stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the same lids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out a method to extract your
terpenes with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's and then try to
innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once you've kind of copied the
base, I'm not even being joking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what everyone does anyway, once you've
got the base, then your responsibility is
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like, OK, I totally like fucking
copied everything about these these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to make it something
different for the customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, that's all that
competition is really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about making the product better for
the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter if I don't like that
you want to start a company or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end user is the person who's going to
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do a great job and you copy
Blue River, but then you come up with your
[SPEAKER_00]: own method and you innovate and you create
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to you're going to
you're going to be the next step in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, it will be something someone
who comes along and kind of copies the
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because listen, there's half a dozen
companies and they've all pretty much done
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've copied Blue River, whether they
want to say it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they've done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even thinking about it before
we started having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They heard the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They watched what started happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they then they jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not I don't know why we shit on
people so much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you think that fucking Eminem
just made up all like he was inspired by
[SPEAKER_00]: rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he had to go and show his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all we all kind of are inspired by the
Giants whose shoulders we get to stand on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the people that we're going
to, you know, copy a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why we're so afraid to say it
when it's like if you're inspired by
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, imitate, emulate, innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to say it and fancy
beautiful words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very nice way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're basically going to fake
it till you make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to copy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to innovate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble bags were the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took mad fucking slack for a decade
plus over something that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's be honest, bubble bags are
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They blow isolator bags right out of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were for North America when a
European woman who was promoting this
[SPEAKER_00]: process was not doing any promotions in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to North America and I promoted
this when it was very illegal and shared
[SPEAKER_00]: it and showed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what bubble bags did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't the first, but they have been
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it shows you that the first isn't
always the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not even being like joking at
all when I say copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say James, get in touch with Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one that knows more about it in
my circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach him at Peter at
SoilBalancePro.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also Google Soil Balance Pro just
in case to make sure that's the right
[SPEAKER_00]: email and it should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did watch the Eminem thing that was
trending recently about the story of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much Dre put himself out there and how
many people, I guess what Dre was saying
[SPEAKER_00]: was like racist people in his life that he
didn't even know were that racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, talking about Em because he was
white and had blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a fuck what color you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do the job, then I could care
less if you're purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the job, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you miss that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's missed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every, well, I mean, that's been a lot of
work too, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: isolator bags were known better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of work sharing this
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys haven't noticed,
I try to share it in a very like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to shamelessly plug my
company if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to shamelessly promote my
company over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You very rarely see my logo or me wearing
one of my own shirts or my own hat for
[SPEAKER_00]: that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to like stay away from that
shameless plugging, but I figured my way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could market my product is A,
coming out and having conversations with
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, sharing bowls with you guys,
answering your questions and always being
[SPEAKER_00]: there to support and give tips and answer
in regards to the curing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and the preparing and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I'm going to stop any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually getting pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning my trip for Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be flying there in the next
like week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a whole bunch of cool shit
happening in Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of blew up with these
products that we've had registered with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ministry of Health and these permits
now that we have to grow and process and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate, which is growing actually,
research and development, produce products
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, and sell those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be getting lots of videos
We're going to be rolling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony and I are rolling in a week after
Ernie and Amy from United Cannabis who are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be going in and doing a little
doctor training, going to a conference in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony and I are going to be heading to a
conference in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be kind of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fly into Kingston,
but eventually end up in Mo Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll have a couple of days in
Toronto afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends want me to come there
and teach them how to make water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, if I can't facilitate helping my
friends make water hash, then I'm failing
[SPEAKER_00]: miserably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, potency, you know, we used to be
really impressed with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were up in the 70 plus THC and
the oils guys would come in and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have 80 plus percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly, but surely we learned about the
importance of the modulating effect or the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage or the ensemble effect of
terpenes and how it creates more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spacey full kind of like what I would call
high versus THC and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I would call stoned, very
one-dimensionally, just kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes, they're much more of an
ensemble and that just changes the game
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're more impressed with 40,
50, maybe 60% THC and in that a large
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to microplane bubble too
much, but if I do, I absolutely freeze,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% Lutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Blue River 2017 is the new Canadian
discount code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please share that with everyone you guys
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it up on my Blue River accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All lowercase B-L-U-E-R-I-V-E-R-2-0-1-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue River 2017, that is the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna get you 30% off your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hundred bucks off a Jamaican
mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 50 bucks off each Californian vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold a schwack last month when I did
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Blue River 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, DK Trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to live in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my company, you have to live in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma Cup is the next cannabis culture
event in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I ever sent you anything well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever won anything on my channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you meeting up with your reggae
brethren when in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're like our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will absolutely be meeting up with
our reggae brethren when we're in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't think of it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like them coming here and not
calling me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be tripped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, well, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today you won this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the RU Elite pin from the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the PTFE sheet that you can put your
rosin on or squish rosin in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turp proof, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get this little, this little
silicone dab a dab a doodle little here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put your oil on here and it's kind
of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, send me an address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an address now, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of go to the post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you guys aren't sending me the
addresses right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bitching, but I'm saying,
can you please send it to me before the
[SPEAKER_00]: show is over?
[SPEAKER_00]: bcbubbleman at iCloud.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there is a new vape pen coming up
for Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, if you send that right away,
I'll get this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the last couple of pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did just send a big, there was like
seven people, including Melty Heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I hadn't sent the large PTF oil slick
tube to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff's been sent just the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me $115 to send.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had like eight or nine things saved
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vape pen we had designed by Gary from
Omicron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to pump out disposable
pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like, California has this huge
marketplace for distillate mixed with
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenes, Gold Drop and Blue River are
crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do distillate, but we figured out
a way to do rosin and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate-like product without the use of
chemical solvents and adding the turpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted was a pen I could put my
name on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a pen that I could feel good
about, that people weren't throwing away
[SPEAKER_00]: each time they smoked a half gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had Gary design us a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also designed the Hercules,
which is a beefcake, like last you forever
[SPEAKER_00]: type shit cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had him design our cartridge so it's
renewable, it's not disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got applicators that you can buy
the product a little cheaper afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll be able to fill your own pen
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be the Trinity cartridge,
the Bubble Man Trinity cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, from Omicron and Blue River is
going to have a little sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be available in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they're going to be refillables
and they'll be sold through, I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: Harborside and BPG and maybe, you know,
L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush or the Real Green Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they've got some shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't figured out exactly who's going to
carry it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have five or 10,000 in hand,
all filled up, I'm sure someone will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I will puff the Klein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how small the Klein is compared to
the Egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a difference, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's about 7.7 inches and this one's
just under 9 or just at 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we got a little dab there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a big dab now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're having a nice time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon we're going to be doing wake and
bakes in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing wake and bakes in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best part about going to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't stop my shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I maintain and continue consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, it's going to be three
hours later once I get over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you won't be seeing me at 9 or 10,
but it'll be more along the 12 to 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma Cup is September 9th and 10th,
and you can go check them out at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .thecarmacup.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or just Google the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come up right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Grant Wendling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like I gave that good of
information today, but ooh, that hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hurt, that hurt, that hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a little nerve damage to the knuckle
on my pinky on this hand, and now every
[SPEAKER_00]: time I bang it or touch it, it's like
electricity flowing through my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to have another little
dab because that was a stinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please come to the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you have something worthy of
entry, enter, whether it's a solvent or a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to hit your non-solvent,
as I am a celebrity judge, and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to try your guys' hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked the West Coast boys to enter
and the Glacial Melts boys, and I've asked
[SPEAKER_00]: D420K and a few other friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the great gardener enters all these
things, so there should be some nice hash
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and to taste, but if you guys are
out there in the world and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking see how you stand amongst these
guys, dude, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great way to become the next Conor
McGregor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come knock it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I'm planning on coming to
Washington anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He enters all these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys that loves to enter
and take place in the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to pour a little bit in
here this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chazzed good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls it off and puts it in the middle
in a way that I can't even explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to talk about here,
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of shit going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, listen, don't be nervous at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cough a lot because I take rips that
would crush your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're terp rich, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about the size of the rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how much terpene there are present in
the rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cough not a lot, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, one of the things that
I'm doing that maybe a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't doing is sitting and talking and
using my vocal cords and vibrating my
[SPEAKER_00]: vocal cords without the use of water or
taking sips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also puffing extremely strong
concentrates with terpenes added to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people's mouths would dry up and
their heads would shrink and they'd just
[SPEAKER_00]: be here not talking in the way that I'm
able to actually articulate my
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a cold right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very rarely get colds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my throat feels pretty good other than
the fact that I took probably 10 rips
[SPEAKER_00]: before I went live and then a couple of,
no, I've got a little bit of water in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pipes even, oh, don't worry,
Raymond, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still fucking doing this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not leaving anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could talk about the reason why
people complain about expensive art.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't have that kind of money,
it's hard to imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do that not just with art,
but any type of valuable thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone chooses to have that actually has
the means to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's somewhat petty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the analogy I use often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go on a plane and complain
if I'm in coach and there are people in
[SPEAKER_00]: first class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: First class, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sit there going, why is first
class tickets so expensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should they get to sit up there when
we have to sit back?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my God, dude, listen,
just take your place, wherever you fit,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you can afford, and don't be too
upset about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, there are experiences where it might
come in handy to be upset that monetary
[SPEAKER_00]: situations keep us out of certain areas,
but really, who fucking cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are buying $40,000 rigs,
$50,000 rigs, $100,000 rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crunk sell for mad dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100k plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: To each their own, chilling like a
villain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone wants to spend 400k on a
fucking Lambo, so be it for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone wants to give away a little
five or $10 thing every day on their wake
[SPEAKER_00]: and bake show, well, good for them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too upset about other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm very, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone asks me if I'm elite,
I think it comes with being humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, oh, you're elite,
dude, you're elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a whole bunch of aspects of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm elite in the ability to isolate
glandular trichome heads, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: whole other parts of life that maybe I'm
not so elite whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working on those parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always trying to maintain the hash
knowledge as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how you doing, Rob Moore?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for those cannabis
cartoons of Hash Church, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily funny joke ones,
but actual our voices and our faces put
[SPEAKER_00]: into much the way they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this guy do with the Joe Rogan
videos, have Joey Diaz or Joe Rogan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're just sitting around the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their real voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool, I think, if some
certain little knowledge bombs,
[SPEAKER_00]: little 30 second knowledge bombs,
minute long knowledge bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be a cool thing to
animate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did see your one the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel weird, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We support Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did it, 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to have a call here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do have a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sent me that email, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, water, and I will get you these
three little things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three little things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta put the pipe over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess in the meantime, we will see
all of you guys tomorrow on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Friday tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple more wake and bake
episodes before we have a Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a fucking stellar Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you it'll be a Hash Church
unlike any Hash Church you have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please help promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let people know that it's gonna be one
worth catching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm real excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the makings of being maybe one of
the best Hash Churches ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't say that lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, may the Full Mount bless your
bowls sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Peace out, everybody.
