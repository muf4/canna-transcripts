[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Engaya.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Watermelon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's give Engaya and Watermelon a big
round of applause.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try to keep it fresh and funky always.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of fresh and funky, our next
panel is, you know, in every respective
[SPEAKER_11]: area where cannabis legalization is going
on, whether it's under medical or
[SPEAKER_11]: recreational auspices, you have these
gatekeepers, these oracles, these certain
[SPEAKER_11]: individuals that have been there for a
long, long time and in this battle for a
[SPEAKER_11]: long, long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because before this became an issue of
economics, it was an issue of just pure
[SPEAKER_11]: justice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's so important to understand
that when there's, how do I say this?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I never prepare any notes,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But obviously, there's oracles,
there's gatekeepers, and these gatekeepers
[SPEAKER_11]: are what we go to as the foundation for
where everything springs from.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a certain amount of,
lawyers can be real shysters, okay?
[SPEAKER_11]: But in every respective area where there
is the legalization and recreational
[SPEAKER_11]: things going on, there's always a few
lawyers that are hardy activists.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always a few lawyers that actually
lobby against their own interests in terms
[SPEAKER_11]: of making money and that is by reducing
and ending criminal penalties towards
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody likes to see injustices if they
make money out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only person that likes to see that are
DAs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you call those in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crown Counsel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Crown Counsel.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure they're dicks, okay?
They're wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are my words.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that, I'm gonna give it up to Mr.
Kirk Tussaud.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an extremely powerful panel of
three of the top advocates in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna introduce Kirk Tussaud here.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the man, if it wasn't for Kirk
Tussaud, none of us would be even in this
[SPEAKER_11]: room right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So give it up for Kirk Tussaud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Alex, very much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And thanks to the ICBC for putting on this
incredible conference.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a great two days.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope everybody's enjoying themselves as
much as we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna just give you the format of what
we're gonna do here today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna give a little bit of an
introduction of these two fine gentlemen
[SPEAKER_12]: to my right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give an overview of Canada's current
medical cannabis regulatory policies.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna pose a couple of questions to
these very smart individuals.
They're hopefully gonna make me look good
with their answers.
And then we're gonna kind of turn it into
just a discussion.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping to have a lot of
participation from the audience.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you've got a question about the
medical regime, the transitions towards
[SPEAKER_12]: legalization, it's probably shared by
everyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll do our best to sort of dust off
our crystal balls and prognosticate a bit
[SPEAKER_12]: and try to talk about how things are right
now and where things might be going as we
[SPEAKER_12]: move this policy, this industry,
this culture forward here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to my right, joined on the panel here
is Rob Lorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the principal of Ad Lusum Law
Corporation based in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_12]: He attended UBC at Oxford University.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was called the bar in the United
Kingdom in 2006 in the province of British
[SPEAKER_12]: Columbia in 2011.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob's doing a ton of work right now
working with dispensaries and then others
[SPEAKER_12]: in the cannabis industry here in Vancouver
and then really across the province.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a real pleasure to have him on
the stage with us right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Immediately to Rob's right is a man who
probably needs no introduction.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the godfather of ganja litigation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob and I would be not doing what we're
doing and certainly not doing it anywhere
[SPEAKER_12]: near as successfully as John Conroy,
QC, Conroy Law, and really his list of
accomplishments in prison law reform and
fighting for human rights.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fighting for people's rights and being the
founder of our whole Canada back in 1971.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not much you can say.
[SPEAKER_12]: My mentor, one of the best lawyers I've
ever known, one of the best people I've
[SPEAKER_12]: ever known, that's John Conroy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's kick this off with sort of where
we are right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: As a result of litigation brought by John
and a team of lawyers back in 2013,
[SPEAKER_12]: 2014 when the government of Canada moved
away from the medical marijuana access
[SPEAKER_12]: regulations and medical cannabis exemption
scheme and as its primary focus personal
[SPEAKER_12]: and caregiver designated production for a
limited number of patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lawsuit was filed called Allard versus
Canada because the government of Canada
[SPEAKER_12]: chose to transition away from that system
towards a commercially oriented system.
Called the MMPR or Marijuana for Medical
Purposes Regulations.
[SPEAKER_12]: That system took away home and personal
and caregiver production rights entirely
[SPEAKER_12]: from all patients and it forced you
instead to access your cannabis from a
[SPEAKER_12]: group of then non-existing but now
existing licensed producers who have
[SPEAKER_12]: managed to navigate a very top heavy
bureaucracy and obtain licenses to produce
[SPEAKER_12]: and sell cannabis to other patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's fair to say that that system
has not worked very well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Up to this point I don't think we
necessarily need to belabor that right
[SPEAKER_12]: now.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that lawsuit triggered success earlier
this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: The MMPR was struck down in their entirety
as being unconstitutional in February of
[SPEAKER_12]: this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: The court in a very well thought out and
strong opinion eviscerated the crown
[SPEAKER_12]: witnesses who suggested that there was
some sort of intrinsic danger in producing
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis and they'd destroy your home.
[SPEAKER_12]: Burn your neighborhoods down and do all
these terrible things that was,
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's not true, not believed by the
court.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the court gave the government six
months to fix the access problems existing
[SPEAKER_12]: with the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what the government did is brought in
this new acronym, this new regulatory
[SPEAKER_12]: scheme in August of this year called the
ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're really in the infancy of this new
program.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ACMPR, the Access to Cannabis for
Medical Purposes Regulations promulgated
[SPEAKER_12]: under the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act, essentially did a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: They breathed new life into the commercial
production aspects of the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was sort of brought back,
but the license producer system remains in
[SPEAKER_12]: place.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has not been significantly streamlined
as of yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: There continue to be hundreds of
applications in the pipeline that aren't
[SPEAKER_12]: really moving at the pace that are
necessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also very difficult to navigate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they sort of mushed that together with
the old MMPR and the new MMAR.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in effect, the ACMPR and the old MMAR
are pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: They feature pretty much the same process
for getting, it's no longer called the
[SPEAKER_12]: license, that was called the registration.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably call it the license many
times during the course of this talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's basically the same.
Allopathic physicians, scientific medical
documents, that's all of your dosage.
[SPEAKER_12]: You submit that to the government and then
register yourself as a personal producer
[SPEAKER_12]: of a number of plants that are calculated
based on that dosage.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have roughly five plants per gram per
day for indoor production, or two plants
[SPEAKER_12]: per gram per day for outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you can designate someone to produce
for you on your behalf.
[SPEAKER_12]: They become the grower, and they can then
afford it, and they can charge you.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can provide the medicine to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Designated producers can service at most a
maximum of two patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a feature of the old system that
was preserved in the new system that
[SPEAKER_12]: exists in a constitutional room.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can maybe get into that later.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can have a total of four
production licenses or registrations at
[SPEAKER_12]: any one physical site.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, that's a holdover from the old
system.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a number of tweaks and features
to the ACMPR, but in sort of broad brush
[SPEAKER_12]: strokes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we have.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the MMPR and the MMAR pushed
together, and you have one system for
[SPEAKER_12]: commercial producers and one system for
home and or designated producers.
[SPEAKER_12]: The injunction that was granted to
preserve MMAR rights for about 28 years to
[SPEAKER_12]: 20,000 patients continues to have vitality
today.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were protected then, you're still
protected now.
[SPEAKER_12]: The government's gonna have to go back to
court to try to undo that injunction,
[SPEAKER_12]: and they may do that at some point in the
future.
[SPEAKER_12]: If, however, anything needed to change
from that status quo, as of at the end of
[SPEAKER_12]: 2013, early 2014, you need to now go
through the ACMPR and remove your licenses
[SPEAKER_12]: to grow in a different location,
to increase your dosages, to change your
[SPEAKER_12]: designated producer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Any changes to the status quo at the time
of the injunction require you to be a new
[SPEAKER_12]: participant in the new system.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the broad brush strokes over you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna kick this off by asking Rob a
question.
[SPEAKER_12]: If in his review of the new ACMPR,
are there pressure points and issues that
[SPEAKER_12]: he's identified that could be problematic
in that regime as we move forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Kirk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just start off by saying it's a
real honor to be up on a panel with these
[SPEAKER_09]: two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be part of this great conference.
[SPEAKER_09]: So give yourself a round of applause for
coming here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Problems with the ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, to start out with, this ACMPR was
really designed to salvage two medical
[SPEAKER_09]: programs that have been in place for a
while.
[SPEAKER_09]: The difficulty is, as Kirk mentioned in
the panel this morning, doctors have been
[SPEAKER_09]: forced with the role of gatekeepers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so under the ACMPR, you still have to
go to a doctor to get the aid,
[SPEAKER_09]: what would be known as a prescription
usually.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the problem is doctors are not signing
those as readily as we would like to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though if you do get a permit under
the ACMPR to grow cannabis, well,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not like you can pop down to Crop
King Seeds or, you know, Mark Emery's or
[SPEAKER_09]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to buy your seeds from limited
supply and limited sources.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my opinion, that doesn't really seem
like a free and fair market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, limited strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: The licensed producers in many respects
are limited with what they can supply the
[SPEAKER_09]: patient market with respect to what Health
Canada says they can.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, unless you fit within those
very limited exceptions, you have a
[SPEAKER_09]: problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you do get your prescription or
recommendation to grow, well, what do you
[SPEAKER_09]: do for the three to six months of your
first cycle, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, that's why we're seeing
dispensaries, unfortunately, or
[SPEAKER_09]: fortunately, however you want to see it,
are really going to remain the reasonable,
[SPEAKER_09]: dignified patient access.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me just see the other pitfall.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a story.
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad was recently diagnosed with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I had followed the law and waited
for him to get a doctor's prescription and
[SPEAKER_09]: so on and so forth, his stage one rectal
cancer would have spread.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I gave him an address of a farm
admission and he's been on the
[SPEAKER_09]: suppository.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess it illustrates the problem of,
do I follow the law or do I help my dad?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can assure you I'm going to help my
dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know the majority of the folks out
there that are requiring access to
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis can't get it without feeling like
they're in a position where they're
[SPEAKER_09]: breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's the biggest issue that
this legalization question has to address.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are my thoughts on the limitation
of pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think, Kirk?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think Rob identified six points.
[SPEAKER_12]: One was the doctor's gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_12]: The second one was the limited sources for
starting somatics.
[SPEAKER_12]: Third is limited strains available in the
LP system.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fourth is access for home producers or
designated producers during in-treat
[SPEAKER_12]: cycles or downtimes or if you have crop
failures.
[SPEAKER_12]: The fifth is that dispensaries are now
part of the legal regime currently and yet
[SPEAKER_12]: they're the primary access point for most
patients in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then six is related to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's a limited range of
products available in the lawful regime.
[SPEAKER_12]: So John, hearing these problems identified
with the ACOPR, what are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_12]: as we transition towards legalization,
how some of these different points can be
[SPEAKER_12]: addressed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my hope is that many people will
apply under the ACOPR, whether they like
[SPEAKER_07]: it or not, if for no other reason than to
tell us what problems they're having.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, Allard, the injunction
continues until the court orders otherwise
[SPEAKER_07]: or until further order of the court.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those people who were fortunate to be
granted access are protected by the
[SPEAKER_07]: injunction, but they don't lose that
status if they apply under the ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got all of the people who were
called the left outs or who weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: covered by the Allard injunction who now
can finally apply to get their licenses
[SPEAKER_07]: again and at the locations that they
wanted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because one of the biggest problems was
trying to change your location.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you have to, though, remember that
this was a temporary solution that was
[SPEAKER_07]: forced on the government by the order in
Allard.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had six months to come up with
something to fix the defects in the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also remember that the evidence in
Allard pointed to the defects in the MMPR,
[SPEAKER_07]: which led to the patients voting with
their feet and going to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which led to the surge in dispensaries,
which leads to the argument that really
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries are lawful in that they're
simply filling the void that was created
[SPEAKER_07]: by the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's still a temporary solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to know what the problems are that
people are having with it because there
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to be more changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Task Force on Legalization,
there's a whole part of their mandate that
[SPEAKER_07]: deals with medical and so my view is as we
move towards legalization, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_07]: it seems very difficult to get some people
to overcome this attitude that they have
[SPEAKER_07]: to cannabis in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully they'll realize that they no
longer need all this security.
[SPEAKER_07]: They no longer need all of these
limitations and restrictions that they've
[SPEAKER_07]: imposed simply because of this somewhat
ridiculous fear that it's all going to go
[SPEAKER_07]: into the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea, in my view, is to flood the
market so that there's lots of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: around and there's no longer any interest
or profit to be made as far as organized
[SPEAKER_07]: crime, which they always throw up as being
the people who are out there trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: make a profit out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we will transition into a
situation where, as is apparently
[SPEAKER_07]: happening now in California, they're
trying to ensure that the small producers
[SPEAKER_07]: are protected and are able to participate
in the market, not just big producers,
[SPEAKER_07]: so that all of the people who've learned
how to do it well and produce good strains
[SPEAKER_07]: will be able to continue and to
participate on a fair basis with others.
[SPEAKER_07]: That the dispensaries will continue to
exist in terms of the medical but as a
[SPEAKER_07]: distinct perhaps a group compared to
stores that will be able to provide legal
[SPEAKER_07]: access to people for social purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so my hope, and it is a hope,
but I'm not, I've been around and have
[SPEAKER_07]: been involved in this for so long that I
am somewhat cynical as to what will happen
[SPEAKER_07]: once the task force hands this over to the
politicians, even though the politicians
[SPEAKER_07]: are saying they will legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: What form that takes is of significant
concern.
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully they will come to their
senses and realize that there's an
[SPEAKER_07]: existing market with existing suppliers,
with existing distributors, with existing
[SPEAKER_07]: stores, and they will try to simply
regulate them in a fair way as opposed to
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to change it by squeezing this or
squeezing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just going to create more problems
and more mitigation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I say, they've created the,
as Kirk points out, part one of the ACNPR
[SPEAKER_07]: is the old NNPR, part two is the old NNAR
with a few tweaks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because of the abuses by doctors in
particular, the colleges across the
[SPEAKER_07]: country and the Canadian Medical
Association and provincial associations
[SPEAKER_07]: have clamped down on the doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has created a problem for those
doctors that did have a positive attitude
[SPEAKER_07]: or knew something about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're all fearful that they're going
to be hauled up in front of the colleges
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really it's the doctors who are
charging huge fees and who were,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, having people just line up and
signing for them without bothering to do
[SPEAKER_07]: anything as far as their medical situation
is concerned.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard even charging on a per plant basis
was the last one that I heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can understand why the colleges
have come in because they see some of
[SPEAKER_07]: their members clearly just, you know,
in a total conflict of interest just doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it in order to make money, nothing to do
with the medical situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the doctor gatekeeper thing I see
as the looming problem, which is not a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem necessarily of the ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is to the extent that we've always said
doctors of tradition of Chinese medicine,
[SPEAKER_07]: naturopaths, people who know something
about real cold plant medicine should be
[SPEAKER_07]: involved, not just allopathic medicine
types who are used to prescribing a pill
[SPEAKER_07]: and take two of these and they'll end up
with $5.00 type of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that certainly is a tweak
that could be, I think, a part of a
[SPEAKER_07]: criticism of the ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bigger problem is how to get these
colleges to come to their senses and to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, get up to date in terms of the
information that's out there about
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and its uses for medical purposes
in particular.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, we had the Murnau case
some years ago, which unfortunately didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: get through due to a lack of evidence on
some of the areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really need to document the problems
people are having because our art is until
[SPEAKER_07]: further order of the court.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so at some point in time, whether it's
us or whether it's the government,
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll be back in court.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to know and have evidence to
show the court what the problems continue
[SPEAKER_07]: to be so that the court will hopefully not
just say, okay, the ACNPR is the solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you complaining about?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all over.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I've been saying fine if
you're protected, great, but if you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: protected both, protected and unprotected
should apply so we can see what the
[SPEAKER_07]: problems are and document them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can at least have that body of
evidence to produce to justice field when
[SPEAKER_07]: we do have to get back into court.
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly hope that the government
legalization model will undo huge numbers
[SPEAKER_07]: of these restrictions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm troubled when I hear the
chairperson the other day, I was quoted as
[SPEAKER_07]: saying that young people shouldn't smoke
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it causes cancer, which then I say
to myself, well, you obviously haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: kept up to date in terms of what the
smoking of cannabis and the difference
[SPEAKER_07]: between smoking cannabis and cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that there is no evidence of cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the opposite, that there isn't
emphysema, that it is a bronchodilator,
[SPEAKER_07]: these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that patients, some patients need to
smoke it because they need rapid onset.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eating it and waiting an hour isn't going
to work for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, getting them to what I
understand exactly how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I shake my head because I've been
involved in it since the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_07]: People were being sent to jail for simple
possession in those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, so from where I sit,
things look way better than they used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we still have these ongoing issues and
problems which astound me that they
[SPEAKER_07]: continue to some people to have this sort
of attitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fight isn't over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have obviously some looming
issues to come.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I think, you know, our
experience with the task force,
[SPEAKER_07]: those of us who appeared in front of them,
was very good in terms of being able to
[SPEAKER_07]: provide them with information.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the information seemed to be very well
received in terms of all sorts of areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, you know, even if they come up
with a good model, we have seen even this
[SPEAKER_07]: government have committees, not follow the
recommendations of the committees,
[SPEAKER_07]: not follow the recommendations of their
independent senate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to say it's a wait and see,
A, as to what they recommend, and B,
[SPEAKER_07]: then what the politicians do with it
afterwards.
All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we're going to turn it over to
the audience and see if we can get some
[SPEAKER_12]: questions if anybody has anything they
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for coming here and talking
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to know what kind of legal
consequences could you expect for an
[SPEAKER_06]: unlicensed grower arrested for cultivation
if that grower can prove that cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: could be sold for medical purposes in a
licensed dispensary?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so that's a sensing law question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could throw something else in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And John will tell me where I get it
wrong, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_12]: But where are you?
[SPEAKER_12]: The number one question is, where are you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because sentencing tends to be different
in different provinces.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a fairly long line of
sentencing authority in British Columbia
[SPEAKER_12]: imposing very lenient sentences for
producing cannabis for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_12]: even if contrary to existing licensing or
outside the licensing scheme.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, a lot of that case law imposed was
called a discharge, which is a finding of
[SPEAKER_12]: guilt and no entry to criminal conviction.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's obviously a pretty good result if
you get to that point.
[SPEAKER_12]: The difficulty is that the conservative
government's changes to the Controlled
[SPEAKER_12]: Drugs and Substances Act increasing the
maximum penalty for production from seven
[SPEAKER_12]: years to 14 years and imposing mandatory
sentencing in some cases means that
[SPEAKER_12]: production as an offense is no longer
discharge eligible.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you cannot receive that outcome of
guilt but no entry to criminal conviction.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're found guilty, you will be
convicted.
[SPEAKER_12]: You will have a criminal conviction
entered against you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the penalty's gonna range from at the
low end, perhaps a suspended sentence,
[SPEAKER_12]: or a fine, or some kind of probationary
disposition, to at the higher end,
[SPEAKER_12]: potential mandatory minimum sentencing
legislation based on the number of plants
[SPEAKER_12]: and the presence or absence of any
aggravating factors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those laws, those sentencing laws have
been, from time to time, found to be
[SPEAKER_12]: unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it remains to be seen whether they
would have any continued vitality going
[SPEAKER_12]: forward, but they still are on the books.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't believe the litigations
progress to the point where you can say
[SPEAKER_12]: with confidence that they would not
necessarily apply to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those tend to kick in after six plants
between six and 200 for only the purpose
[SPEAKER_12]: of trafficking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Between 200 and 500, there's another range
of penalties.
[SPEAKER_12]: And over 500, there's yet another range of
potential mandatory minimum sentences.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be that what prejudiced you in
life was getting a conviction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've written a paper on the
prejudicial consequences of a
[SPEAKER_07]: non-conviction in Canada, where people get
stays of proceedings as the crown suddenly
[SPEAKER_07]: drops the charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's happy thinking, oh,
the charge has been dropped.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'll still have problems at the
border with a stay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have problems at other places with
a stay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing they do is withdraw the
charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this digital age, I'm afraid,
has created a situation where whatever's
[SPEAKER_07]: in the digital database somewhere,
oh, you were seen in a car with somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: who had a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your passenger had a joint 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a guy like Corporal Holmquist,
who was the main witness in Allard,
[SPEAKER_07]: who I just spent the last week arguing
about again in another case, he's the guy
[SPEAKER_07]: who goes to these databases and digs it up
and causes these problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got convictions and sentences.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kirk, if you could refer to the
discharges, it was the current prime
[SPEAKER_07]: minister's father, Pierre Trudeau,
introduced absolute and conditional
[SPEAKER_07]: discharges because of the cannabis
offenses to try and reduce the
[SPEAKER_07]: consequences for people of having a
record.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should know that even if you get
an absolute discharge, the record remains
[SPEAKER_07]: for a year before they have to take it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a conditional discharge, it remains
for three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in more recent times,
because we've always complained about the
[SPEAKER_07]: over-incarceration of people in the
country, the government brought in
[SPEAKER_07]: conditional sentence orders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a conditional sentence is quite
distinct from a conditional discharge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is sort of the last step before
actually being sent to prison.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you could have a conditional
sentence where you serve your sentence at
[SPEAKER_07]: home or at least in the community subject
to various conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before conditional sentence orders
existed, we used to be able to get people
[SPEAKER_07]: probation and a period of maybe a couple
of months of house arrest so they could
[SPEAKER_07]: still work, support their families,
and so on and so forth, even though there
[SPEAKER_07]: was a sanction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just argued a case maybe six months
ago now called Neary in Saskatchewan where
[SPEAKER_07]: we argued that now, with the government
having said it's going to legalize,
[SPEAKER_07]: so what is the crown supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the defense supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the judge supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: In sentencing, the principles of
sentencing that one looks at, a major one
[SPEAKER_07]: is to denounce the conduct.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we said to the judge in
Saskatchewan, well, the government here is
[SPEAKER_07]: on one hand saying, give this guy 15 to 19
months.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a trafficking possession with the
purpose of trafficking case, about 30
[SPEAKER_07]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the other hand, the government's
saying, we're going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So denounce conduct.
[SPEAKER_07]: You say you're going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another sentencing principle is to deter
others who are like-minded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you're going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the other ones are, are you
reformed and rehabilitated?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, usually it's a year later and the
person has usually managed to do all sorts
[SPEAKER_07]: of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: To appear at least to be reformed and
rehabilitated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other one is specific returns.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we said, look, the crown here wants 15
to 19 months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've taken away, the conservatives
took away the ability to impose
[SPEAKER_07]: conditional sentence orders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here was a classic fellow who would
have got a conditional sentence order if
[SPEAKER_07]: they still existed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't need to be sent actually into
prison.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to my surprise, the judge accepted our
argument.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, we are in an interregnum
period between kings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gave him probation with a couple of
months of house arrest and some other
[SPEAKER_07]: ancillary orders, firearms, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the government has appealed that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they run the risk of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal hopefully accepting the
[SPEAKER_07]: position.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just heard the other day they want us to
be there November 10th.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's more likely to be at the
end of November.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also heard other counsel have
succeeded in a dial and dope case to get a
[SPEAKER_07]: conditional discharge for somebody based
on the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it, Jordan?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a recent sentencing in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're encouraging other lawyers and
certainly people who are facing these
[SPEAKER_07]: sorts of issues to get their lawyers to
make that same argument and rely on Neary
[SPEAKER_07]: to point out this problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've criticized some of the Crown
counsel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known some of the people in the
Federal Department of Justice for a long
[SPEAKER_07]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're quite candid, some of them
with me, not all of them, but some of
[SPEAKER_07]: them, about how they're in this awkward
position.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're certainly getting conflicting
positions here in terms of what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, as Kirk mentioned,
mandatory minimums, it's ridiculous that
[SPEAKER_07]: they've brought in these mandatory
minimums.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's ridiculous that this government
hasn't moved to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That should have happened by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet we're still forced into situations
where we have to make these arguments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a guy next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a guy who went and watered plants
to make a little extra money.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wasn't involved in any other aspects of
this grow operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wasn't benefiting in any other way from
it other than being paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the only one charged because they
screwed up in relation to the main people
[SPEAKER_07]: and all the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're wanting three years mandatory
minimum for this fellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you say, okay, so we're going to
have another challenge to the mandatory
[SPEAKER_07]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have another challenge to
the fact that they took away the
[SPEAKER_07]: additional sentence orders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to wind its way,
these cases are going to wind up their way
[SPEAKER_07]: up through the courts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And come the spring, they're supposed to
legalize or start the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are the judges supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sitting there saying, wait a
minute, this doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really need to somehow get the
current federal liberal government to move
[SPEAKER_07]: quicker or move faster and get this sorted
out so that we can put this behind us and
[SPEAKER_07]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to agree with your
point that doctors are an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors are not available in a lot of the
province.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people don't have doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get access to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, many people can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Vancouver, there's lots of
doctors, but out in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just simply not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, the licensed producers in
the old MMOR regime, they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: forced out because they can't afford the
access barriers now that are in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're changing the whole base of the
industry into these great big players that
[SPEAKER_00]: are squishing up the little guys that
actually form the industry and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: on the front lines fighting all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, I'd just like to point out,
I finally did get access to a temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to get, I applied for and got my
medical pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were mentioning, and I also saw on
the website that this would be two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: per gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: An outdoor license is approximately two
plants per gram per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're issuing under the old amount
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got issued one plant per gram outside
and 3.7 per inside.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you went with a split license
indoor-outdoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a different formula.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an indoor-outdoor license.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can only grow indoors or outdoors at
any one time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the formula is different if you apply
for that licensing because the assumption
[SPEAKER_12]: is that you're going to grow indoors
during the indoor cycle and outdoors
[SPEAKER_12]: during the outdoor cycle.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they sort of think you'll produce X
amount of cannabis as a result of those
[SPEAKER_12]: two, three cycles a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the things that's carried
forward in the ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only grow indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would think people would start
indoors, try to get them outdoors when you
[SPEAKER_07]: get some good weather to reduce your hand
group costs, and bring them back in before
[SPEAKER_07]: the fall sets in, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: So there continue to be these issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no doubt the ACMPR, and to be
fair, you can't, no regulatory schemes can
[SPEAKER_12]: capture every potential factual situation,
but that's why the scheme ought to have
[SPEAKER_12]: some more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the end of the day, any plant
number is pretty arbitrary, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_12]: What does it matter?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should you have to grow four big
plants instead of 40 really small plants?
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's your preferred growing
method.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of the day, the question ought
to be, are you growing that for commercial
[SPEAKER_12]: purposes?
[SPEAKER_12]: In which case, there's a different system
for you to be part of.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you growing it for yourself or
permission to caregiver?
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it's a different quality of entire.
[SPEAKER_09]: What most people overlook is, because it's
been a criminal issue, but now we're
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at product liability.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I hear from the old MMAR growers,
they say, but I had a right to grow and
[SPEAKER_09]: sell it to people under MMAR.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, no, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had the ability to grow for yourself
and grow for someone else, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you then give that product or
sell that product in a commercial retail
[SPEAKER_09]: setting, there's a whole bunch of other
rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for any of the lawyers in the
room, you only have to look at Donahue and
[SPEAKER_09]: Stevenson, which was a case of a snail in
a bottle of ginger beer in England about
[SPEAKER_09]: 100 years ago, which essentially means
that you have a duty of care that is owed
[SPEAKER_09]: to the ultimate consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're selling or producing a
product, and then that goes to the
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary, and then the dispensary sells
it on to somebody, well, you then have to
[SPEAKER_09]: ensure that that product and you meet the
duty of care to the ultimate consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so really, until we figure out
definitively how are we going to get
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis by the mail, dispensary,
liquor store, that's really going to
[SPEAKER_09]: determine a lot on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need a few good lawyers by the
sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are these people?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we not free?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who gets to tell you how many
plants you can have?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is cannabis treated harder or harsher
than tomatoes or potatoes and all that
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff?
We've actually known for a long time that
they're full of shit, that they lied
[SPEAKER_08]: through their teeth about this,
that cannabis was never a dangerous drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was only ever a threat to corporations
and people who wanted to sell their stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the whole thing is it's a huge
scam, and it's a huge crime against us,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's continuing, and there should be
some repercussions for these people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They shouldn't be able to just get into
the business of now selling us weed after
[SPEAKER_08]: they spent their lives penalizing people
for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need some lawyers to go after these
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be held to the fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a huge, huge crime.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say on the question of,
you know, should lawyers go after people
[SPEAKER_12]: that are legislators that then get into
the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, in law you have to have
causes of action.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to have base seats for lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't just sue people because you
think they're bad people or did bad
[SPEAKER_08]: things.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've hurt a lot of people, and they've
known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in law you need a cause of action to
sue someone, and it is not, to my
[SPEAKER_12]: knowledge, a cause of action to be wrong
in legislative policy, change your mind,
[SPEAKER_12]: vote for something new, and then later
become part of that industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a cause of action.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying prosecute for the ones
getting into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying the ones that maintain these
prohibitions, knowing that they were wrong
[SPEAKER_08]: and in violation of free people and
hurting people, that's a huge,
[SPEAKER_08]: huge crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: My quick answer to you is I think
education, how we help Donald Trump
[SPEAKER_01]: supporters through education, I think will
make some better decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have two questions, completely
unrelated, but maybe sort of related.
[SPEAKER_05]: My first question is, just voicing more of
what Jody was asking yesterday,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is going to happen to the people who
have already been wrongfully incarcerated
[SPEAKER_05]: for using cannabis, simple possession,
once legalization comes about,
[SPEAKER_05]: or those people are going to be remaining
in jail, what's going to happen with their
[SPEAKER_05]: process?
[SPEAKER_05]: My second question is actually just more
to what you were mentioning.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people in rural communities don't
have access to doctors that are on board
[SPEAKER_05]: that choose not to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that that's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering, isn't that doing harm by
choosing to remain ignorant to something
[SPEAKER_05]: that has a lot of- Well, really,
but it's philosophical, but it's also
[SPEAKER_05]: legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my two questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't we, John, you've had many more
clients wrongfully incarcerated than I
[SPEAKER_12]: have.
John is actually an expert on prison
reform, so that's a great question.
He is.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's an expert on prison policy,
but fighting for the rights of prisoners
[SPEAKER_12]: just as long as the rights of cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what does happen?
[SPEAKER_12]: What can and does happen when we legalize
cannabis to all the victims?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my hope and expectation would be
that we will have the government commuting
[SPEAKER_07]: and providing amnesty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or remission of these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a process for getting raw
prerogatives of mercy and pardons and
[SPEAKER_07]: these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would expect that there will be some
movement to try and decarcerate people in
[SPEAKER_07]: that situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, my position is broader than just
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that drug use of any kind
should be subjected to the criminal law.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a health issue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: With trying to control people's use and
providing a black market for organized
[SPEAKER_07]: crime, essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just absolutely stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of your other question,
I mean, I think, again, the digital age
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully will enable people by Skype and
other sorts of ways to be able to access
[SPEAKER_07]: doctors remotely in order to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that some doctors are doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the college sometimes raises issues
with them doing that if they're in
[SPEAKER_07]: different provinces and things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But surely that's the obvious solution is
if you're in a remote community and you
[SPEAKER_07]: don't have a doctor and you're entitled to
reasonable access, the doctors who
[SPEAKER_07]: understand the issue and who are
supportive should be able, you should be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to access them online.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to throw that to Rob.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there in your view a cause of action
against an individual doctor or a college
[SPEAKER_12]: for its prescribing or prescription type
policies or refusals to assist patients?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's definitely a cause of action.
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is finding a cause of action
that the courts will take serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, one of the big difficulties when you
go up against a regulator, which has had
[SPEAKER_09]: authority delegated or power delegated to
them by the government, there's an
[SPEAKER_09]: expectation that while the government
entrusted the college with power to
[SPEAKER_09]: essentially make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, their job is to try to regulate
policy the best as they can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'll be devil's advocate,
they may not get it right all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: They get it right sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that's really how things
evolve and get better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the answer that you need to be
looking at is instead of like,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, I need to deal with the college.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to fight all these battles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the better way to look at it is
did women wait around to get the vote?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they engaged in civil disobedience
until the laws and the rules change.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's so fascinating about, you know,
we saw an hour, they didn't really address
[SPEAKER_09]: the issue of dispensaries, but despite the
intense enforcement in Ontario and the
[SPEAKER_09]: lack of enforcement in British Columbia
creates this patch quilt scenario where
[SPEAKER_09]: the difficulty, I see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we had Brendan Kennedy this
morning and it's all very impressive,
[SPEAKER_09]: but this is a race to the bottom,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks have been growing and engaging in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of our clients have been
doing this for 40 years and I'm confident
[SPEAKER_09]: tomorrow they're gonna wake up and
continue to do what they're doing
[SPEAKER_09]: regardless, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so really these are who the corporate,
and I work, I have a Wall Street
[SPEAKER_09]: background.
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked in London, City of London and New
York with the CIA's law firm on Wall
[SPEAKER_09]: Street.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of this really is, ladies and
gentlemen, is designed to be a mouse trap
[SPEAKER_09]: to essentially work for the people that
lobbied and popped me a put policy for the
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So every day that you go to a dispensary
and make that decision to shop there or to
[SPEAKER_09]: inform yourself and educate yourself and
make the decision that if cannabis is
[SPEAKER_09]: right for you, that's a decision that you
need to make.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you can, thank you.
You can wait for the weather to get it
right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I'll use an analogy as they
say in Texas.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can wish in one hand, shit in the
other and see what fills up first.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my secret question is if the government
may or may not get it right, well,
[SPEAKER_09]: show them how they should do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where I think the future really
is civil disobedience and social
[SPEAKER_09]: engagement because it's the communities
that are making the changes and the monies
[SPEAKER_09]: are flowing up the grassroots back to the
community, not to Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just speak to the issue you said in
terms of the doctors and the colleges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the colleges are doing the right
thing, in my view, in trying to clamp down
[SPEAKER_07]: on the doctors that are abusing the
system.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's having this impact in affecting
reasonable access.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think in the short term,
we need to get the doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a group of practitioners,
cannabis medicine, I think it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: if I'm getting the name right,
that is a group of doctors across Canada
[SPEAKER_07]: who are fully supportive and knowledgeable
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: These folks have to be the ones going
after the heads of their colleges and
[SPEAKER_07]: being the ones to try and bring them,
educate them and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like we lawyers, if it's the law
society or the Canadian bar, we need to be
[SPEAKER_07]: the ones who go there to do it rather than
just thinking you can start a court case
[SPEAKER_07]: and somehow that will sort the problem
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just have a quick story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry for you, though, because we're
all mentioned women on the right to vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to remember that it was one of
the famous five who wrote The Black
[SPEAKER_07]: Candle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was The Black Candle that was
serialized in McLean's magazine across
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada that was based on all the stories
in the US that led to 1923 cannabis being
[SPEAKER_07]: put in the schedule to the then opium
narcotic back following on what we did
[SPEAKER_07]: here in Vancouver when we had all the
Chinese who came and built the railroads
[SPEAKER_07]: and were our best workers and many of them
were killed doing so.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had opium dens.
[SPEAKER_07]: They brought the opium with them from
China after the opium wars and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had opium dens all over Vancouver,
Victoria and New Westminster, more than
[SPEAKER_07]: the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a labor situation that led to
them kicking, shutting them down and
[SPEAKER_07]: kicking them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to the Dominion Annual
Statistics, you'll see Chinaman deported
[SPEAKER_07]: possession of opium prior.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you look into the history of
drug prohibition, it all goes back to
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chinese in terms of opium,
the black people in terms of cocaine,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was the Mexicans in terms of cannabis
starting in Utah with the Mormons and then
[SPEAKER_07]: spreading across the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these sorts of things still happen
where people say we're losing our jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They blame people of color.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these sorts of situations develop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to try and all rise above these
sorts of things and try to educate people.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can make an observation before we get
to another question.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people say, well, what's going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's look at another simple example
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: So history repeats itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Penthouse Nightclub and the Commodore
Ballroom got their licenses in 1969 and
[SPEAKER_09]: 1971 respectively.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what was happening during the 40s,
the 50s, the 60s, and then early 70s?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they remained open.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think really the key is if you
survive and stay open, you will in 20,
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 years get a history commemoration
plaque from the provincial government.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think really just think of the words
of Fidel Castro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Condemn me, it's not important.
[SPEAKER_09]: History will absolve me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what's going to happen in
this market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we have time for maybe two more
questions.
One here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'd love to talk to you before
in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People keep telling us, oh, it's going to
be legal in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just impatient once it's legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, I don't feel it's going to
be legal in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would expect people to still be
charged for possession all through 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious as to what you feel about the
timeline for the federal, provincial,
and municipal legalization.
If you think I'm right, there'll still be
possession, arrest, and enforcement all of
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you should anticipate as the
timeline over the next year or two when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're actually going to be able to buy
some kind of government-approved cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: with Justin Trudeau's stamp on it in the
store at some point.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we may have different views on
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave my view earlier today in an earlier
panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just repeat that briefly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'll flip it over to these other
gentlemen to look into their murky crystal
[SPEAKER_12]: balls.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the timeline that we know is that next
month, the task force is going to make its
[SPEAKER_12]: recommendation to Bill Blair.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bill Blair will then regurgitate that up
to his bosses, ministers of justice,
[SPEAKER_12]: health, and public safety.
[SPEAKER_12]: With his own commentary added into it,
they've told us that that's the timeline.
[SPEAKER_12]: The government has promised to introduce
legislation in the spring of 2017,
[SPEAKER_12]: spring session of parliament, last of all,
mid-June 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would expect that if legislation's
introduced at first reading in the spring
[SPEAKER_12]: of 2017, we don't get through third
reading in that spring session.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I expect the whole thing's over until
the fall session of 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: I expect there will be extensive committee
hearings because despite the fact that the
[SPEAKER_12]: government has said it's not about whether
we're going to do it, it's how we're going
[SPEAKER_12]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They know the eyes of the world are upon
Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've said that repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's going to want to have their
piece of the action and a piece of
[SPEAKER_12]: publicity in Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that that could drag on through
the remainder of 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the bill goes to the Senate for
review.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do committee hearings.
[SPEAKER_12]: They look at it some more.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it goes back to the House.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it goes back change, the House has
to sort of then either adopt those changes
[SPEAKER_12]: or try to override them.
[SPEAKER_12]: My own guess is that we don't have
legislative change until early 2018.
[SPEAKER_12]: That legislative change is also going to
require each province and territory in
[SPEAKER_12]: this country to participate and to have a
distribution plan ready because the feds
[SPEAKER_12]: have signaled they're going to retain
jurisdictional or manufacturer production.
[SPEAKER_12]: The provinces are going to deal,
the territories are going to deal with the
distribution piece.
So I think we're a long ways out from
buying legal cannabis in a store,
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever that store might look like.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_12]: The tragedy of this all is that people
continue to be arrested for violating
[SPEAKER_12]: these laws.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to tell you, it doesn't have to
be that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Public Prosecution Service of Canada,
before filing charges against individuals
in British Columbia, have to determine
whether filing those charges is in the
public interest and whether there's a
substantial likelihood of conviction,
[SPEAKER_12]: not discharge conviction if you file the
charges.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could stop prosecuting simple
possession offenses in this country as a
[SPEAKER_12]: matter of policy and prosecutorial
discretion today.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason it hasn't happened is
because the political pressure has not yet
[SPEAKER_12]: been applied sufficient to make them,
the liberals believe that this is a vote
loser in the next election.
And they're probably right about that.
At the current calculation.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think pressure will continue to
build because the judges, as John was
[SPEAKER_12]: recounting to you, when you put in front
of a judge the idea that you've got to
[SPEAKER_12]: sentence somebody for simple possession or
even for growing or trafficking cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: when we're making it legal, the judges are
scratching their heads and saying,
[SPEAKER_12]: what are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_12]: And at some point, it may get taken out of
the hands of the government by the courts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a fear there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't disagree with Gert in terms of the
timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the spring, they're supposed to
introduce legislation and we'll see what
[SPEAKER_07]: happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a similar problem to the US where
the US, you can have a government that
[SPEAKER_07]: takes a position, but you've got a
Congress that's stacked with still
[SPEAKER_07]: Republicans here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Senate that still has more
conservatives.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that needs to be fixed in order to make
sure everything goes through.
[SPEAKER_07]: My experience with, as I said,
when I started, people busted for very
[SPEAKER_07]: small amounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting 30 days in jail and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And throughout the 70s and 80s and so on,
I've seen that reduce and reduce and
[SPEAKER_07]: reduce.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be $100 fine was very common.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then discharges.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not get people charged with
possession anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had a possession case for ages,
other than sometimes a large amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: That in the past, they would always charge
possession for the purpose of trafficking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's a simple possession.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm talking Abbotsford police,
who aren't known for necessarily them
[SPEAKER_07]: being very progressive in this area,
at least in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even RCMP, who were thought to be less
progressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I see them coming around quite a
bit as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty key.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we still are always going to run into
that problem of they'll use the smell in
[SPEAKER_07]: order to get into your car to find out
what else you've got or to arrest you
[SPEAKER_07]: simply to then hassle you a bit before
they then drop the charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, my concern is that you're in a
database.
[SPEAKER_07]: The minute that happens, you're in the
database.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some further information that
can prejudice you in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully, we will at least see big
movement in the simple possession area.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what really needs to be addressed is,
as Kirk said, the distribution and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to remember that at the moment,
the federal government has the
[SPEAKER_07]: constitutional power under its criminal
law power.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act is a criminal law statute.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if they take it out of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the schedule, then they're no
longer using the criminal law power.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the power?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's health.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a divided field between the
provinces and the federal government.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need the provinces to get involved
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been not jumping in at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in Seattle, Washington,
the district attorney there made it part
[SPEAKER_03]: of his platform when he ran that he was
not going to prosecute simple marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: possession cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told the COPS Act and arrest dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is before the initiative passed to
legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to the other point about the
two-part point, that's what Oregon did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They legalized possession first,
and they came up with regulations to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have time for two more.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you had your hand up the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to be quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 3.30, so we've got to make way for Ed
Rosenthal here, folks.
I've got a question for the panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: The MMA are individuals who are not pro
for themselves, friends, and family.
[SPEAKER_10]: The MMPR allowed these juggernauts to grow
from multiple patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to two Smiths and one Toussaint,
the derivatives were allowed to be made by
[SPEAKER_10]: these juggernauts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems that they are limited to 3%
potency.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a form of insanity to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the ACMPR, I'm told that individuals
that used to be MMA holders are now
[SPEAKER_10]: allowed to make derivatives.
[SPEAKER_10]: The legislation still states that you're
allowed to collect four licenses to one
[SPEAKER_10]: property for growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been told that you're allowed to
collect the outdoor storage facility under
[SPEAKER_10]: multiple licenses, and perhaps that would
be a good place for individuals to do
[SPEAKER_10]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a limit on how many licenses can
be in one storage facility, and is there a
[SPEAKER_10]: limit on the percentage value of the
extraction made in those facilities?
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of patient-making extractions,
extractions are derivatives.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have any potency limits in
place.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not subject to the restrictions
that the licensed producers are.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you are restricted to is that you're
unable to make any extractions using what
[SPEAKER_12]: the ACMPR defines as organic solvents.
[SPEAKER_12]: Organic solvents is then defined as
butane, a couple other chemicals,
[SPEAKER_12]: and a catch-all is basically anything that
can blow up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Smith overrides that restriction.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the derivative may have is that if
you can safely have very good defenses
[SPEAKER_12]: under the charter, that that restriction,
as opposed to the ACMPR, is
[SPEAKER_12]: unconstitutional on its face.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a couple of cases currently of
pretty big extract facilities that the
[SPEAKER_12]: Crown's making me off as you can refuse
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they want to litigate that
issue in the medical arena right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer to the question of extracting
is no organic solvents, otherwise no
[SPEAKER_12]: potency limits.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your storage location under the ACMPR for
a production license has to either be at
[SPEAKER_12]: the production site or at your ordinary
place of residence.
[SPEAKER_12]: Production site is artificially limited to
four because you only have four licenses
[SPEAKER_12]: at production site.
[SPEAKER_12]: I suppose if you had 20 people all living
together in the same house, there's no
[SPEAKER_12]: restriction that those 20 people could
have their storage site at that one
[SPEAKER_12]: location.
Then doing extraction there, the question
would be is the extraction, is the
derivative making part of the production,
or is it part of possession?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not defined by the ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_12]: The locus of your derivative making hasn't
been mandated.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to theoretically,
you could aggregate a whole ton of people
living under one roof and tons of storage
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would give you protection for a great
deal of cannabis to be stored there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Creative compliance is sort of my manager.
[SPEAKER_12]: The government makes rules, lots of them
are arbitrary and silly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Creatively comply with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as you're not breaking the rules,
you're not engaged in unlawful conduct.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we're creative people,
so we can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember, this is politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you have an explosion and a
fire and somebody gets hurt, it sets back
[SPEAKER_07]: the cause.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you have people stinking out
the neighborhood because they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: controlling the smell of their production,
you set back the cause.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get constant complaints from inspectors
in various municipalities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Conroyd, there's a grow there and they're
stinking out the neighborhood and we've
[SPEAKER_07]: got all the neighbors to clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to get somebody in there to
teach them how to do it without stinking
[SPEAKER_07]: out the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want the neighborhoods on our side come
the spring.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want them against us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you,
Alex.
We saw you on stage last night.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, wow, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much the bang for the buck
right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to know what's going on in
Canada, these three guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You three gentlemen, if I can ask you just
to go outside because you will be mobbed
[SPEAKER_11]: at this dirty time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, make some noise if you're having a
good time.
We
[SPEAKER_11]: have an amazing special guest for you
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is, he is the.
