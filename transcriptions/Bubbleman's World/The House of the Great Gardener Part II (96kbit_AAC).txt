[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning everybody!
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, good morning and it's time for
Awake and Bake with Matt the Great
[SPEAKER_08]: Gardener, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glad you guys could make it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty excited to have this giant tub
of your Afghan 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, microplane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or should I say GG1?
[SPEAKER_04]: GG1, we've changed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've changed it for the European seed
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani just, everybody uses the term
Afghani and the Afghani that we have,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, we've had it for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've crossed it back into itself so many
times that it's no longer what it was when
[SPEAKER_04]: we bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the GG1.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the GG number one now.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're looking for the Afghani from
the Great Gardener in the near future,
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll be looking for the GG1.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what, you guys got some... We've got
that around here somewhere because we just
[SPEAKER_04]: got the new seed packs in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoked on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these seed packs are awesome because
they protect the seed a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sort of folds around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the hayoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So seed packs like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayoma on the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little disclaimer on the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you open it up, it has
pictures, description.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's a little bit more protected,
a little bit more professional.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really nice, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, honestly, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bud of the sweet scone right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a nice photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure who you had do the
photography, but that looks great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We took them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always like harsh photographers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see like bad photos on seed packaging
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's nice to see a nice shot like that,
sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm coming to a store near you soon in
multiple countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pier Sativa in Europe and Pier DNA in
South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: See everybody down in Chile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booth 52.
[SPEAKER_08]: Santiago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to going down to South
America and seeing what they have to offer
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark's ripping the dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't smoke buds or anything,
so I've had to sort of sit here and smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: all these.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a Warlock Gigi number one
cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the number seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always tell which ones are better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring them in the house and by the
time, it's almost like a race,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time you usually finish one,
it's because it's the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is the standard on how
Shivaratri, when the Sadhus would get
[SPEAKER_08]: together and smoke in different events in
Kathmandu Nepal, Shivaratri being Shiva's
[SPEAKER_08]: birthday goes on for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they would put out the hashes almost
buffet style on plates and the hashes,
[SPEAKER_08]: of course, that were the most popular and
the best tasting and the nicest high.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were gone first and it was no trophy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just like recognition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I saw your plate was empty first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one's the number seven of the
Warlock Afghani Gigi one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just got a great smell to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that look nice?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have probably, we just did a room that
had 60 different phenotypes of the Warlock
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani, the Warlock Heyoma and the JT15
cross with the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 20 a piece or something?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of, we each got down to 20
each.
[SPEAKER_08]: So 20 phenos of each of the three strains
and he's boiling it down, bringing it
[SPEAKER_08]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 20 that made it to production.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably started with probably 30,
40 of each.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, you have a couple that
are just terrible veg growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you sort of take those out because
you're looking for, although sometimes the
[SPEAKER_04]: terrible veg growth turn into fantastic
things as the purple tangy feno that we
[SPEAKER_04]: had was fantastic, but it had a terrible
veg growth on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes you should just throw those
ones away and don't flower them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to give the axe to something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put it in the corner and see what it
says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or clone it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to put the axe to
something, clone it and then put the axe
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you'll turn it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I guarantee you Murphy's Law will
always say, that that little one in the
[SPEAKER_04]: corner that was a straggler was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know what's going to surprise
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the unique thing about the
House of the Great Gardener and Matt in
[SPEAKER_08]: particular is that he's a connoisseur on a
multitude of levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's what I would consider someone that
knows good hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: He understands what great hash is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet he's a unique individual who,
no matter how much great hash he has,
[SPEAKER_08]: he still smokes joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he can come to cannabis from that
perspective of life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the spliff, through enjoyment of
the spliff, where for myself, if I started
[SPEAKER_08]: breeding or helping anyone breed,
it would certainly be through the resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't really be breeding potential
strains that tasted great in joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have that ability to sort of like,
how do I want to enjoy this medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've thought many times on how can we do a
breeding program specifically on smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hash quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I finish this, I'll sort of show
you how we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually fulfilling these sort of
dreams of breeding in different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than just sort of looking and
smelling the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using the science, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Using the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt has the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to tell you about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exciting stuff too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have some over here but I'm going
to wait for you to take your hit and for
[SPEAKER_08]: you to talk about it because nobody knows
that information better than you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it is your information.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am a mere guest at the house of the
great gardener.
[SPEAKER_08]: And happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my god, that Afghani is just so
piney.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump right in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we know which one is which now?
[SPEAKER_04]: On the top it'll say, it says P right here
at the top of that letter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the Haoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that one's the Haoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the PR.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hertz.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: The C, Canotonic, the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I wanted to look at because I
brought the Afghani right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said it was piney.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go down to pining, B pining,
positive B pining.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got 5.82%, basically 6% of
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is piney.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, does it smell great?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're looking at are turpinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll photograph it and put it into the
sheet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you talk about each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Tangy, I've got Digley Canotonic,
I've got Haoma CDD, I've got Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you have Haoma Canotonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have all the cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have all the heavy metal charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got mold, bacterias.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting it done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the turpinoids, the turpenes,
are the latest kit on the block that we
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Canada can get tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us, it's like, I think you have the
Afghani, you have the Canotonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have also the Afghani
Canotonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can look at the Afghani and turpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at the Canotonic profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we cross them and create the
children, we can create, we can look for
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a prime example is the Haoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the Afghani ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Haoma here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Haoma's the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Haoma was a project of taking the
perks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which just purely for its fantastic flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I have here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has a not so good veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the perps is classic for being a
weak vegetative structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buds get big and then it just gets all
floppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our project was taking the perps,
crossing it into the Afghani that has a
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastic veg structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But retaining the perps profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to mildly interrupt here.
[SPEAKER_08]: 56% Beosamine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then limonene you have as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: D-limonene, 16%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you look at the Haoma's results.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not 52 or 56% osmine, but it's like
44% osmine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the limonene dropped right down and
it picked up in pineene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the Afghani, it's got the
pineene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool way to start looking at the
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, our goal now, this is going back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have these results when we
created Haoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just went after the sort of smell and
the flavor from smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which you know, you look at these charts,
you're like wow, we were bang on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well of course, that's how those charts
are created.
[SPEAKER_08]: The love of cannabis is often through the
smell and the tastes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course people are going to breed
via those things, whether consciously or
[SPEAKER_08]: subconsciously, over the last however many
years we've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I stick my nose in this Afghani,
I love the idea of being able to sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: see the Afghani profile of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another piece of the puzzle,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: One by one we're sort of going through all
of these terpenes and we're looking,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're Wikipedia-ing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're sort of like, oh what's that,
oh valencine, oh valencine oranges,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh pineene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes, they all have other smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of these, I think there's only like
one, I think it's the cariophylline that's
[SPEAKER_04]: specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually the terpene that they
use to teach the police dogs how to find
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's the only terpene that's found
specifically in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the other ones can be found in other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, mangoes, hyanmersine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, there's a variety of all,
I mean these are essential oils.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turpenes are essential oils.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go to your aromatherapy store and look
at that whole wall of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are, there's hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that's going on right now is all
terpene isolation and figuring out these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we haven't quite figured out the
medical, you know, what's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: medically with having these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like can we take CBD and strip away all
the terpenes and just have that sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you it wouldn't work as well without
having all these different flavors in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the different combinations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these, you could come up with a
billion combinations.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why pharma's always been afraid of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it was 10 plus years ago that
Skunkman Sam was telling me that terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: modulate cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been 10 years and now people are
starting to get kind of caught up on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I ask you, do you see it in the near
future being so important that the terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: content would take as important as,
say, CBD in the main?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have somebody coming into
a club and they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want something high in THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't have any mercine because
mercine and me don't go together.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can start sort of figuring out
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the limonene that's actually picking
me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happens out there is that you
have so many strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once the strain gets popular and
once people start buying seeds of that
[SPEAKER_04]: strain, there are variations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll go into a club and be like,
hey, can I have that skunk number one?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go to another club and be
like, oh, they have skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you buy that skunk number one and you
take it home and it doesn't do it for you,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different phenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So terpenes are one of those things that
are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the way you dry it and the way
you cure it is so important because that
[SPEAKER_08]: can affect the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we know these terpenes are
volatile at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super volatile.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can smell them sometimes just in a bag
of herb sitting on the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get the whiff of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, wow, that shit's evaporating at
room temperature into the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you get the really old bud that just
has the hay smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's so old, all your terpenes are
gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've all escaped.
[SPEAKER_04]: It evaporated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're left with, just that sort
of hay smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it was a nice herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's fresh in the terpenes and
terpene isolation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was finally the killer rip I got.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what have we got left on the chopping
block for today?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go see some more cannabis
plants, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll go visit the Hayoma CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seed room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go visit the drying room that has
the 50 or so other phenotypes in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always fun though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were looking to see some Renee.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some Renee dried in a bin
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have a look at Sirius Seeds' new
strain, Happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happiness?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their AK-47 cross with a warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to tell you, I have two
fantastic phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One's a little better than the other,
but they're both pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had been a while since I've sort of
had that, where I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, my day is over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got so debilitatingly stoned off it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what a great, I mean, if a warlock
with an AK-47 doesn't make you happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a powerful, powerful punch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll look forward to making some hash from
that strain in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy a nice, powerful punch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a powerful punch about three
minutes ago when I hit this Afghani.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: D420K trying to FaceTime me right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to put him on pause.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I guess we're going to continue
our wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we covered everything we wanted to
talk about?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're definitely getting baked.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should probably talk about a few more
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_04]: What have we got on the table here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little wool from a sheep that I
was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: My girlfriend Sarah went to Glastonbury,
the festival.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you went too, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Stonehenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw all your pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like I was there with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is some stuff we collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: We collected this stuff actually at
Avebury, which is kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: Glastonbury, or kind of like Stonehenge,
but bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big on a bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got all this little rocks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a crazy place.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody gets a chance to go to England,
and go to Stonehenge, and go to Avebury,
[SPEAKER_04]: and these ancient, ancient sites,
there's nothing better than sitting up
[SPEAKER_04]: against one of these monolithic rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulled out a doobie, and you're just sort
of leaning up against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just get this air of ancientness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're sitting somewhere that someone
else smoked a doobie thousands of years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's literally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never been to Stonehenge,
but I had the feeling when I took
[SPEAKER_08]: mushrooms in Palenque, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have this, I guess, Paco Votan is
buried in this pyramid.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't know he was there for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember the picture of Paco Votan
in the Mayan, where he's in the space
[SPEAKER_08]: ship.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, that's Paco Votan.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a huge, big piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I think actually the piece they broke
in to find the staircase might have been
[SPEAKER_08]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mayan sun that has the calendar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was this huge, you know,
stone this thick.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to smash it, or remove it,
and then it was a staircase down into this
[SPEAKER_08]: like, you know, seriously old tomb where
Paco Votan was buried.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on top of his tombstone,
like the big stone on top, was that
[SPEAKER_08]: picture of the fucking, of him in the
space ship with the thing with his nose
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you man, like that place was
heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just pyramids everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're standing on one pyramid,
and it's like you, it's a big,
[SPEAKER_08]: vast courtyard with like pyramid over
there, and one over there, and like
[SPEAKER_08]: another big open yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ancient, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, this is a heavy place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I get that, and I've always felt that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to do Stonehenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to do Cusco.
[SPEAKER_08]: Machu Picchu, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all these sort of like,
unique places around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ancient.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, ancient, ancient spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go to the footprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the foot, it's like a six foot
footprint, and it's in the rock,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's been in the rock so long that the
rock has sort of pushed it up,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's now vertical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look at it, just look up,
it's like a seven, just google it,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven foot footprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's in South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up, but it's, you'll see this,
and I mean it's just, it's a foot,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a footprint of the rock, and the
dude's like standing beside it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's massive, and it's so old that the
rock, it's like in a vertical position
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to wrap your head around that.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why I love getting Wake and Bake
with Matt the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little hit of water, so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little hit of the Warlock Gigi number
one, number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gigi one Warlock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta watch it with that Warlock.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Warlock stuff though, gets me super
big.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2003 or 2004, when Breeder Stead was
living in Lugano, when I went to see him,
[SPEAKER_08]: he just happened to have this tunnel,
and he was like, oh you know, just cut a
[SPEAKER_08]: bunch of buds out.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first ones I saw were all these
Warlock buds, so I just chopped all these
[SPEAKER_08]: tops off Warlocks and went back to my
hotel, the Cadro Panoramica in Lugano,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was like a tennis resort in the sort
of foothills of the mountains overlooking
[SPEAKER_08]: the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just asking for bucket after bucket
after bucket after bucket after bucket
[SPEAKER_08]: after bucket of ice, because Steve gave me
so much weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I made a lot of Warlock bubble,
and I smoked that shit all over
[SPEAKER_08]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a picture of the Warlock hash,
and a little black glass pipe,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then the Matterhorn in the background
with like the... The Warlock hash is like
[SPEAKER_04]: the barber bud hash, in sort of the
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It punches through up to that high-end
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we won the second place there
at the High Times Cup in the concentrate
[SPEAKER_04]: category with Warlock dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: We mixed a little bit of a Haoma dry sift
in with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: When was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it the Hydra.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing some more Warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit finicky?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's finicky, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, Steve sure killed it, I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those were the first buds I saw,
and they were killer!
[SPEAKER_08]: Just but in the south of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just were so happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smell and everything that comes off
the Warlock.
[SPEAKER_08]: The structure of the bud really looked
really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just... filling a bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I still had the picture,
because it was Steve's two friends from
[SPEAKER_08]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not friends, but younger kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess friends of the family.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were 20-something years, and so it
was like, yeah, yeah, come on out and you
[SPEAKER_08]: can work in the greenhouse or in the tents
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I have pictures of them with the
trunk open in the Audi.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on either side, kind of going like
this, and the Audi's just full of these
[SPEAKER_08]: big four foot long boxes that are filled
with tops and stuffed into the back of
[SPEAKER_08]: this car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard stories of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's a good time too, when I've got great
hash like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exciting times in Canada, and nice to see
the house of the great gardener just
[SPEAKER_08]: having growth with its distribution,
because I sure get a lot of people
[SPEAKER_08]: constantly asking me where they can get
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm unable to send you guys clones,
but you can get the strains through the
[SPEAKER_08]: variety of seed banks from Attitude and
Pure DNA, Pure Cetiva, and of course the
[SPEAKER_08]: Vancouver Seed Bank here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So... And Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Mark Emery is going to have a...
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're bringing the Vancouver Seed
Bank into Mark Emery's headquarters again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, that's a great announcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fantastic news.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a fantastic news.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, congratulations to Vancouver Seed Bank
and to Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell the seeds back at the BC
headquarters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Emery's headquarters, no?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's next door to the, it's
basically the second floor of the Vapor
[SPEAKER_08]: Lounge where David Malmo Levine had the
museum.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be getting replaced by another
Vancouver Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's exactly Mark who's
doing the seed sales, but it's great that
[SPEAKER_08]: he's even allowing them to be done within
his business framework.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the Vancouver Seed Bank
that's in the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for sure, man, you guys want to buy
seeds, you can buy them from the man
[SPEAKER_04]: himself that went to jail for many years,
paid his price.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody sort of should buy a
pack of seeds from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, honestly, five years.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty...
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're glad you're free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude, we're happy to have you back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you guys in the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we got Sirius Seeds' new strain on
the block.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it the happiness, the AK-47
crossed with the warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, this is a great, great strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like the power and you like the
punch, you're going to love happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two phenotypes in here right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it sort of lines about right
here that just drops off to the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, as usual, Sirius Seeds,
everything is so similar, so unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: so uniform.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, it's got a nice structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic warlock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structure in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting ready to hold something.
Substantial.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the CBD hayoma seed room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you zoom in, it's just getting to
the point where the calyxes are starting
[SPEAKER_04]: to swell with the newly formed seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pistols are pulling back in as that
calyx swells out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's got a fantastic pollination
rate on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayoma CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayoma CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Against the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can see it falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it sort of falling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollinating the hayoma CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: House of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Matt the Great Gardener doing his
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys up to today?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we were just wondering, as a
collective, how you came up with the name
[SPEAKER_08]: The House of the Great Gardener?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a two part answer to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one part answer of The Great Gardener
is I was on an ayahuasca trip once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And during the ayahuasca trip,
I came up to a staircase.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a long staircase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it went up to a round platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I walked up the stairs and went to the
platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this old man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had long white hair, long white beard,
and a flowing robe, sitting on a chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was smoking this big, long Sherlock
pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was just puffing on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sort of opened one eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sort of sees me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gets off his chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he comes over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the platform was way above the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sort of goes over to the edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's puffing on his pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looks over at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Mr. Barron, having a good time
down there, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I'm having a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was telling everybody this story of
this person that I met.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the staircase and the
platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my girlfriend, Sarah, she has a book
of famous ayahuasca paintings of ayahuasca
[SPEAKER_04]: trips, of the Mexican or Peruvian tribe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're flipping through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we're flipping through these
paintings, boom, there is the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the staircase.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is the white, flowing hair old
man in this painting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I start freaking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's the guy that I met.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then beside it, it has a little blurb
of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, oh, all the Peruvians.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mexican ayahuasca heroes depict this
image as the great gardener, the one who
[SPEAKER_04]: looks over sort of vegetation and
everything on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just met the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the house of, the house of the
great gardener pays homage just to my sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of martial arts background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the house of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we combine the two into house of the
great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do the growing goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a chance once to meet the great
gardener and I was blessed and moved and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just, you know, it's just a fantastic
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a logo and then the logo,
which everybody knows as that,
[SPEAKER_04]: as the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: We chose that as the logo because I,
I saw this image and I had the image for
[SPEAKER_04]: years and I was just drawn to the image.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after my trial, I felt it was
like a significant moment in my life that
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to get that image tattooed on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chris Bennett came out with his
newest book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't forget the name of it right off
the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Chris Bennett's newest book?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, in the book, it had this image
and it talks about the Soma Haoma tribes
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Tien Shin mountain range and the
sort of border of China and Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that this was like a cave painting.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the suspected marijuana tribes,
the Soma tribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had tattooed on my leg.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh my God, I have this ancient
cave painting that I tattooed on my leg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even knowing it was cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finding out that it was cannabis
related.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such like a crazy moment for me to
sort of discover that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even my friends, they don't believe me
that I didn't know that it was cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: related before I got it tattooed on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was just a natural sort of image
logo that we used for House of the Great
[SPEAKER_04]: Gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the story of the Great Gardener and
the sort of martial arts background that I
[SPEAKER_04]: have sort of turned it all into House of
the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that became to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for sharing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really got a substantial color difference
between the Barb and the Renee.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have flowered these ones already.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just waiting for the CBD Renee to
get just a little bit more bushier before
[SPEAKER_04]: we flower the whole room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the disadvantages of putting
malting strains and grooves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that just means the barber buds will
just have the arm size buds again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely looking forward to coming
back when these are in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow you up.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reifers lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD Renee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love smoking CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hit a little patty of,
now if I'm correct, it was Congo,
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet skunk, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a little Barb sitting on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a fourth one that was the Barb I
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm about to hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: The weird backlit scene here we've got
going on with the bright light,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's the way it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that both of them on?
[SPEAKER_08]: It is better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a low light camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a great garden, figuring shit out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess this will just be a dump.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the D-nail heating up the whole
temperature.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see the red.
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is red.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see the middle one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely red.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tripping me out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand color blinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that that's blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that that's yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that that's orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they're different shades.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're color blind, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many of you out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just see differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was wonderful taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a nice profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one left on there if you want to
hit that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In between my dubie rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your Dubois again?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was CBD Rene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice and tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see the bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was sitting out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very nice looking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's not rolled into your joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low on blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard low on blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low on blue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always happy to hit a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always happy when I go to a buddy's house
and they've got their own D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't have to actually pull mine out
and put the whole thing together because
[SPEAKER_08]: this one's just always lit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever I come to the house of the great
gardener and I open that door,
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Custom.
[SPEAKER_04]: House of the great gardener style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Custom logo D-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's nice to just have it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the fact that you'll hit your
D-nail while you're puffing a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my D-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love making hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It loves it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching other people do it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to get back to puffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how often do we have to raise these
lights from the time?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're in bloom now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they have been blooming for 10 days
or two weeks or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're going to start stretching
on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll raise them every other week,
a few inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to be raised right essentially
now is the time we raise them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We raise them until about two or three
feet above the canopy, depending on the
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some will like it longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the time, it's too close.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see the ones get here,
they start getting shriveled up,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they can't take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty warm for sure right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely, we'll raise them up a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do we have?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have CBD Digweed, CBD Renne,
and CBD Afghani.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm quite pleased with all of these,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we are too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good run.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I'm on MTV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the house of the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the selection of stickers that you
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we got the Rare Dagnas sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the classic Friendly Stranger
sticker from Toronto.
Classic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Canadian glass gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic event.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody likes hanging out, likes glass,
and likes weed, they'll love the glass
gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, red beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop seeds, not bombs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put this guy over here, but it's like.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just falls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a stainless steel TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Refrigerator, I guess.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we start at the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some wild berry juice and some
mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some dry sift in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is like, you know, this would be
at Jack Herrera one hour ran in June 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stays in sandy form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful texture.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you want your dry sift looking
like for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick the ones that sort of fall over.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's just a Jack Digweed mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a Barb dry sift first, apparently.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just rocking the 99% right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that Digweed February 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a year old.
[SPEAKER_08]: That almost looks like it's starting to go
a little red.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orangey.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Barb first.
[SPEAKER_08]: More Barb first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this guy.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we've got the Barb thirds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what Barb thirds looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe to the non-trained eye, they might
not understand the difference between the
[SPEAKER_08]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD Renee, 30 minute seed run.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right to the frigging top.
[SPEAKER_08]: Found some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Found some.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's her character?
[SPEAKER_08]: Canatonic one hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's just a really nice
collection.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could go through them for a little 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some silver thiosulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything a fridge needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything a fridge needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some Barb 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you need Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that looks rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That totally looks rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Experimentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's press out the Barb 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the other end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rough, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how shiny it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at how harsh that looks.
[SPEAKER_08]: All just perfect and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never forget them saying that the 25
micron bag had no use.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Barb 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that has a use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, as he laughs and drops over the super
shiny piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we still got the freezer, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 24 hour hayoma run.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see how brown that is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's definitely not a gold color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this bag, people are probably like,
oh my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the amount of dry sift that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in actuality, 90% of it is probably
plant matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's probably like 40 grams of
actual medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you look at something like that,
it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just again, it's another 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see it green almost,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in here, we have some newly done CBD
Renee, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that color on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's that 45 micron piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's 73 right above if you want to
lift that one up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just touched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just touched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already gummed up my fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it doesn't take long.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is ready to be microplanned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for touching my human fingers onto
the medicine for those that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So underneath that is fresh frozen because
you've seen the freezer and it's full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of these are all water hash,
different micron, either they'll have an S
[SPEAKER_04]: or an MP, sieved or.
[SPEAKER_04]: Open up a sieved one for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the sieves.
[SPEAKER_04]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the sieves out, apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got sweet skunk, 73 micron,
and it's been microplanned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been frozen and then microplanned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can you can see this stuff once we
get the sort of light back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's like white.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is quite a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the microplanes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the microplanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the Congo sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Congo sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it comes out with a little bit more of
the pellet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I like this is my favorite,
too, is the sieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we looked them under the microscope,
you'd see the microplane.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see the trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see shatter.

microplane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they're watching at home right
now thinking, how do I get a freezer of
[SPEAKER_08]: dry sifted and wet wash like this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say follow your passions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be more organized.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow the herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the lack of organization in

[SPEAKER_08]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see all these ones with Congo and
Afghani and sweets.

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not much left.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so popular.
