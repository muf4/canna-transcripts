[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure we're all good here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure everyone can hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think no sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, listen, welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a little bit of a mild heart
attack.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was telling me that I wasn't able to
stream.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on YouTube today and I had to restart
that little bit freaky.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start letting people in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Hash Church 4.0 episode eight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Legends of Hash sponsorship episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty stoked to have this episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to always talk with some new folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that everyone will be new,
but definitely a nice new group of folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on, Agro Tech?
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were on the ball.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, we want to make sure our
connection works.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to go stream.
[SPEAKER_09]: I basically there's a bunch of stuff I
have to do when I do this because we're
[SPEAKER_09]: streaming through Zoom that ends up going
through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for the first time ever,
when I went go live on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_09]: it said you do not have permission to live
stream.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was at eight fifty nine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just like, OK, I've done this a
couple hundred times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did text Addison and he was like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: So glad to I'm going to just be letting
people in as we go here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reese puffs in the background with the
pipe to match little wormhole,
[SPEAKER_09]: JP wormhole there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got going on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love those pipes, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one shreds for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where to start?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Faces that I don't necessarily recognize.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stoked to have all of you guys in
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, super, super stoked that you
guys, you know, sponsored Legends of Hash
[SPEAKER_09]: got my old Legends of Hash from 2016 and
Barcelona T-shirt on right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the last legends that I
actually threw in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so considering we started and like,
I don't know, twenty two thousand and one
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe two thousand and one might have been
the first Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk a little bit about Legends
history as we slowly get in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love also the fact that everyone's
rolling up with with rigs all set up and
[SPEAKER_09]: ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocking my JP Toro.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's up right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little Terp slurping in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got that right there tattooed on my
body.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't get that off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you can nowadays.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on, Addy?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I'm just getting, you know,
getting to know some of the boys here.
[SPEAKER_09]: These aggro tech boys were on the ball
like 30 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: They came in and I was like, Mike doesn't
play.
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't play.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not missing out.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Mike, you know, Mike and the
boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just meeting Mike and the boys right
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well respected, very loved and revered in
the industry and definitely one of the
[SPEAKER_14]: guys that hunted us down to make sure that
he could sponsor the event.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, good dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: They really, really are all about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, definitely wanted to make
sure that we had everything that we needed
[SPEAKER_14]: to to make this thing a fucking banger.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we love those cats for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, for us, part of the reason why
it was such such a big deal to do that was
[SPEAKER_12]: because, you know, we're really about
trying to give back.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we've been pretty blessed to be
in business for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, everything we do comes from
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_12]: So being able to sponsor an event like
this and directly give back to the
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis community specifically the hash
community, you know, meant a lot to us and
[SPEAKER_12]: was something that, you know, is right up
our alley.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we love smoking hash and getting high.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it worked out really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, we're grateful, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it was like, I think you guys
are one of the first ones to reach out to
[SPEAKER_14]: us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it meant a lot, you know, made it
easier for us to get it started and get
[SPEAKER_14]: everything going.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys and Mills came forward and just
like, you know, pretty much lined us up so
[SPEAKER_14]: we could get started and get everything
going.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're super grateful.
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and for the few people out there,
they're like, whoa, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_09]: Legends?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you got cameras and you're having
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when Addison hit me up a couple
of years ago and said, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should do Legends, you know,
in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I think, you know, Kevin and I can
pull it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, one of the first things he
said to me was, and I'm not sure how
[SPEAKER_09]: you've been doing this out of pocket,
man, but, you know, we're not going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how you've just been paying
for Legends out of pocket because that's
[SPEAKER_09]: how I rolled with Legends for,
you know, the first almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no monetization.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid for everything out of my own pocket
and, you know, just kind of tried to make
[SPEAKER_09]: it go that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it got expensive fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am definitely very thankful to all of
the sponsors and also to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: the team at 800 that we're also not just
willing to, we're not just willing to take
[SPEAKER_09]: anyone's money for sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's almost like the same way,
you know, you're curating the products
[SPEAKER_09]: that you use on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you don't want to be curating
products that you don't use on a daily
[SPEAKER_09]: basis and bring.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were people we said no to.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was, there was a substantial amount
of people that we said no to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you've been curated,
you know, when you get accepted to this
[SPEAKER_09]: sponsorship, it's not just by giving
money.
[SPEAKER_09]: It means that you have the whole
background, the cool, the coolness factor,
[SPEAKER_09]: the factor that you have integrity,
the factor that, you know, that you've
[SPEAKER_09]: been curated by Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's, there's something to be said
by that as well, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: I just chose to have zero sponsors for
like 20 years because I thought the same
[SPEAKER_09]: way with Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time I've ever had a
kind of episode like this, where,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I've never monetized Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never taken any sponsorship money.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never taken anything for Hash Church
because I was worried that if I did that,
[SPEAKER_09]: it would affect the integrity of Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, for me, I was so stuck in
Hash Church, not really realizing what it
[SPEAKER_09]: meant to the community, but after
listening to the community and realizing
[SPEAKER_09]: like, this is really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a conversation that drives our
industry and our community.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very important that we don't
bastardize or, or, or fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been a bit of a nerve wracker,
you know, having, having the monetization
[SPEAKER_09]: aspect for, for, for Legends.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told both Kevin and Addison,
like, all right, let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever you do, don't fuck it up
because this is, this is a, this is a,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is a, this is a long time thing
going, you know, like I sometimes can't
[SPEAKER_09]: even believe that Legends has been
happening for, you know, for 20 plus
[SPEAKER_09]: years, but indeed it has, it's happened in
Amsterdam, God, like 14 plus times.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happened in Barcelona a few times.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happened in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_09]: A few times.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happened in Jamaica once.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're going to be doing the second
one in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, it's a, it's a special thing to
be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just very welcoming to all of you and
stoked that you're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we only have a couple of hours today,
but I want to hear from each and every one
[SPEAKER_09]: of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear kind of your backgrounds
and where you came to this and why Legends
[SPEAKER_09]: is something that you wanted to be a part
of maybe hopefully a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: differently than, than, than any other
event that's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just, yeah, puff some bowls with you
guys and enjoy the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a couple of hours to get high
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're happy to be here and we're
humbled to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, thank you for allowing us to
be here and participate.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm sure I speak for a lot of
the, the other sponsors and people
[SPEAKER_12]: involved when I say that it's,
it's a good circle to be in.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a good group of people to support
all the, all the makers and people that
[SPEAKER_12]: have been invited.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all very high levels.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, for us, it's really easy event
to give back to and participate with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up JP?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: JP's three hours ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's mad ripped already.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been ripping since 9 AM on his side.
[SPEAKER_12]: Start at five.
[SPEAKER_14]: Huge pleasure to have you JP, all you
guys, especially.
[SPEAKER_14]: But JP, I think it's a, you know,
I love the idea and the whole story behind
[SPEAKER_14]: how the slurper came to life and how
Marcus has something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I kind of feel like now it's sort of
full circle and, and just kind of brings
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody closer together.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if, if everyone knows
that story, but you know, JP, you could
[SPEAKER_14]: tell it Marcus, you could tell it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of, you know, when it comes to
dabbing, when it comes to solvent lists,
[SPEAKER_14]: especially, I think the slurper has kind
of added this whole different component.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could take a guy who could dab super
hard on a 30 mil banger and, and rip the
[SPEAKER_14]: fuck out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you put a slurper in front of
them and it's a totally different hit.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a different set of lungs to rip
that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you get a different flavor,
different taste.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can fuck with the temp.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a temp temperature gauge and you
know, all these different things to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need some pearls.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a fucking assistant and ISO dip.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need all these different things,
but the, the, you know, the development of
[SPEAKER_14]: the slurper, I think has changed the
fucking game so heavily.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and, and that's, you know,
we wouldn't have it if it weren't for you
[SPEAKER_14]: and Marcus inspiring.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, so yeah, it's, it's a huge
pleasure to have you with us and,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, really makes me kind of a little,
a little, uh, fan-ish to kind of have you
[SPEAKER_14]: here, but at the same time, um,
you know, I think you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a, it's a hell of an introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot to follow up with.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I'm, you know, I'm just, I'm just,
I'm just glad to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be just glad to be a part of it all,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I think, uh, you know,
if it wasn't for you guys all out there,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, doing your thing and making some
really good, um, hash and showing other
[SPEAKER_08]: people how to do it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And like the pioneering of it all,
I mean, 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's probably longer than that,
but you know, cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I didn't even know I had anything to
do with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: He like wrote, he sent me one one day and
was like, Oh, by the way, here's an
[SPEAKER_09]: article.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I, I was interviewed in the Northeast
magazine and yeah, I was telling the story
[SPEAKER_09]: about your part in the Terp slurper.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, my part in the Terp
slurper, what the fuck did, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he, he told me this story and I
was like, Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, feel free to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's, I mean, it's like folklore
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so, so many people like, you know,
uh, really you inspire a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of my homies and they check you out
and, um, you know, they're always like,
[SPEAKER_08]: yo, did you see that episode about,
or did you see how he's like burping
[SPEAKER_08]: Terps?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see how like they're doing all
this stuff and like trying to like,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was like a thing where,
you know, we were just like, I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: just trying to make a nail that you could
just burp Terps with, but not for dabbing
[SPEAKER_08]: almost just for flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden it turned into,
Oh, let's, let's, let's make it,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's actually make it percolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's actually like make it so that it
percolates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I don't know, six, seven designs
later, here we are, you know, the
[SPEAKER_08]: different tweaks of it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, you know, the fog,
you know, cause you have to test it and
[SPEAKER_08]: then you got to go and make another one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's just like, you know,
before you know it, you're really,
[SPEAKER_08]: really, really high, but you're still like
working with hydrogen and gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and working on a lead and you burn
yourself and you get injured and used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you're just like, Ty, you know,
you're still alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just like, I mean,
it's just like, you know, talk about like
[SPEAKER_08]: working.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super, you know, messed up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, now I can just,
you know, now I can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, no, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm, I'm so used to testing out
prototypes and just going back to the
[SPEAKER_08]: torch.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of us glassblowers do do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I think that's like our thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, at least in, in, in my world anyway,
it's good to know that you were,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's good to know that you were
sacrificing turps to create the slurper.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like a sacrifice, you know,
like throwing a virgin into a volcano or
[SPEAKER_14]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I mean, it was so long ago
that, I mean, you know, things sometimes
[SPEAKER_08]: take a little time to pick up and to like,
you know, get out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and, you know, uh, but at the same
time, you know, there's technology that
[SPEAKER_08]: also helps other things also blossom,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if it wasn't for like, you know,
the, the dab, right, the temp tech,
[SPEAKER_08]: all those devices that people are using
to, to, to, you know, figure out their,
[SPEAKER_08]: their, their flavor zone, their heat temp,
you know, I think that really helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, before that we
were just timing it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes, you know, uh, certain
courses hit differently with different,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it's, it's a game, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's like, Oh, well, how do we
clean it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's like, Oh, we can dunk tank
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think all these things happen and
then it makes a product not seem so
[SPEAKER_08]: intimidating or so hard to, um,
you know, cause the Terp slurper took off
[SPEAKER_08]: in, in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I mean, it happened in the,
in the States.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, like I had
some fan base in the States, people that
[SPEAKER_08]: weren't afraid to like, you know,
go outside the box a little bit and try
[SPEAKER_08]: something new.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and, but in Hawaii, I mean,
such a huge fan base in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess there was like a couple that
were like floating around the island that
[SPEAKER_08]: actually spun the Terps or spun the Pearl
when it was in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the time people were just like
throwing like logs of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, shatter in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like spinning and slowly
evaporating as it was spinning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, before you knew it,
uh, some of these Islanders reached out
[SPEAKER_08]: and were like, yo, did you know that some
of these nails, some of these,
[SPEAKER_08]: some of these, you know, spin?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were just like, nah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then we started like developing
more about that and almost kind of like
[SPEAKER_08]: getting the Vortex or the spinning motion,
because anything that spins is a longer
[SPEAKER_08]: distance than straight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And next thing you know, here we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to take up too much time
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, people are loving this conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Addie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was like where you said that
those guys were running around the Island,
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that turning point that you think
that sort of blew it the fuck up to where
[SPEAKER_14]: it is now?
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it some sort of development in the
pipe or was it just the pearls coming in?
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of blew it up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause now it's like, you know,
to, to, to give you the credit,
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone and their mom is putting out a
slurper or slurper type column thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think that was?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is like just so like incestual and we're
all just like feeding off each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you know, yeah, the Terp
slurper is great, but it wouldn't be there
[SPEAKER_08]: if it wasn't for the dab, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And dad tech, it wouldn't be there if it
wasn't for people like actually like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're actually going to start soaking
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, like, or dunk tanking or, you know,
there's so many different terminologies
[SPEAKER_08]: that people have, but you get what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that when you can like look
outside the thing, you know, because back
[SPEAKER_08]: in the day it was like, Oh, let's just Q
tip it out and keep going.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like, Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put fingerprints on it,
that's going to burn into the courts too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we're, now we're taking care of it
inside and out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're having some interesting designs,
interesting airflow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit unique.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: That has to be clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now what is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You just don't get in a tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you have three tanks,
one for dirty one, you know, like kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: like, um, camp back in the day when there
wasn't a lot of water, you know what I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you had like three or four tubs,
one had soap and then you just rinse one
[SPEAKER_08]: and you just kept on going.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end that was clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm not saying that's COVID
clean now or any kind of like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, whatever, but back in my day,
uh, that was camp.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I have a little dunk tank system
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also, I have a mini ultrasonic cleaner,
which is, you know, like the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the ultrasonic
cleaner.
I have a mini ultrasonic cleaner.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I used to go mess around with
ultrasonic cleaners just to figure out
[SPEAKER_08]: different ways, how to keep the courts and
the product itself clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone make like a ultra like a mini
ultrasonic cleaner?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that that's the best way to clean,
ultrasonic cleaning when, when we were,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, you know, not a lot of people know,
but we used to make, while we still make
[SPEAKER_12]: e-nails, but we used to like really be
heavy in the e-nail space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, ultrasonic cleaning is the best
for titanium or any type of surface
[SPEAKER_12]: really.
[SPEAKER_12]: So does anyone have like a little
ultrasonic bath kit yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I use.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing that for like the last
four weeks now, five weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been using it with my actual glass
bowl for eight years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just recently switched over to
doing it this way, especially the ones
[SPEAKER_08]: that actually have a heating source on
them as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that you're also getting a little,
I mean, you do get a little evaporation or
[SPEAKER_08]: a little quicker, but I think it,
I feel like when you pull it out,
[SPEAKER_08]: it kind of dries quicker because it's a
little hot, a little warm.
[SPEAKER_08]: My test is more to see the longevity of
the nail, to see how long I can keep it
[SPEAKER_08]: from clouding up or chasing or,
you know, doing all the things that
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes quartz gets to a certain point
with if you're like neglected with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I keep having people come in here and
say, like to mention that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: another thing with the slurper is flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of our biggest things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's where Bubble Man came
in was trying to capture that flavor that
[SPEAKER_08]: like, the actual flavor of that's coming
off of the hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's like where, you know,
burp and turps, slurping, any kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: thing like that, like sipping wine,
you know, the way you get the turps is by
[SPEAKER_08]: all that aeration and all that sipping.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you get, you know, it's like
the best way to get flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's where that and between
getting it to spin and everyone coming up
[SPEAKER_08]: with these really cool units to figure out
heat zones and cleaning and all these like
[SPEAKER_08]: dunk tanks and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and the Q-tips and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just been all just like one thing led
to another to get to this point,
[SPEAKER_08]: really.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you the flavor aspect ties into
anyone that's ever hit one of these turps
[SPEAKER_09]: slurpers, especially the first time you
hit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you're getting high for the
first time, especially if you're ahead and
[SPEAKER_09]: you're hardcore, you're not hitting
something through your first turps slurper
[SPEAKER_09]: that you've never hit before.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're pulling out one of your favorites
that you've hit like 10,000 times through
[SPEAKER_09]: 10,000 different ways at 10,000 different
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you're hitting the turps slurper
with the pearls and you got your
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature gauge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was, I mean, it was like,
you know, you get high for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you spend the rest of your life
sort of chasing that dragon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that like that caught the dragon.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the dragon catcher, that turps
slurper.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, boo, blew that out and was
like literally like it was grade eight
[SPEAKER_09]: again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was borderline on the brink of being
more high than I wanted to be,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I have to admit nowadays is exactly
where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was, that was, I will never
forget that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've never gotten high like that
off of it again, but I also just got those
[SPEAKER_09]: pearls to spin in and created a crazy
suction.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, to me, it's all about the
preservation of the volatile organic
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds, getting them from your product
into your lungs as preserved as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the more of these buffers that you put
in, like not letting it sit in one corner
[SPEAKER_09]: of a banger versus painting the entire
tube of the turps slurper, like a rising
[SPEAKER_09]: film evaporator.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is on a completely different level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've, you definitely are a massive
influence in this whole aspect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't even know if you guys get
along or if he's like a mortal enemy or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatnot, but I do got to get, give a shout
out to Brian from D Nail as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause he's also really just geeked out on
focusing on these shapes and the,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the way the surface area
preserves and releases heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've been doing quartz and been
doing silicone carbide and been doing
[SPEAKER_09]: Sapphire and all these different surfaces,
which I find subtle nuances for certain,
[SPEAKER_09]: but nothing like the difference between
hitting out of a banger and then hitting
[SPEAKER_09]: out of a turps slurper.
[SPEAKER_09]: And dude, thank you so much for this
because it's, it's changed the way I
[SPEAKER_09]: puffed for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now that Jameson's here,
let's talk about the cleanliness of our
[SPEAKER_09]: banger basket.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cleanliness of our banger basket.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen a darker yellow solvent
than when I'm puffing with Jameson.
[SPEAKER_09]: This motherfucker puffs the biggest dabs,
like it, like just the most outrageously
[SPEAKER_09]: huge dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even have to be puffing when
he's dabbing in front of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are puffing more than you would be
puffing if you were inhaling your dabs
[SPEAKER_09]: directly into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to the fucking banyan tree in
the house here with, show us your yellow
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking solvent-y banger basket.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's fucking- You could dab his
iso.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, here's the OCD guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, thanks so much for having me,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to do some dabs, I'm guessing
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And shout out to fucking Alex with the
Method 7 hat on.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a fucking really great company.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys know too much
about Method 7, but James is like a
[SPEAKER_09]: surreal character, really interesting
fellow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have to have him on one day and tell his
crazy Paul Newman watch story because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking super out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've never heard that story,
it is out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just shout out to Method 7.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an ambassador for that company and I
think they're doing good things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the idea of people coming up with
ways to preserve our bodies.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one thinking that being under those
high pressure sodium lights for all those
[SPEAKER_09]: years was going to affect their eyes,
but yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get those shades on you and avoid the
headache.
[SPEAKER_14]: True human optimization.
[SPEAKER_14]: It allows you to view something without,
you didn't have the ability before,
[SPEAKER_14]: but you can do your work better and it's
more healthy for you too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Intake of light is really important stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll tell you and I'll lead that
right into photography, which is what
[SPEAKER_09]: photography is, the intake and
manipulation of light.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I'm in a grow room and I'm taking
pictures with my phone and it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: orange, I don't even want to post those
pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just look terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to have shades that you can pull off
your head.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've got the little clips now that
Olo clips or whatever that go over my
[SPEAKER_09]: phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to be able to take the shades off and
take a picture through the blue lens and
[SPEAKER_09]: just turn, actually I was wearing my blue
lenses yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in the forest up North here in
Squamish and I was picking mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_09]: edible mushrooms, and it was literally
helping me see the forest floor better
[SPEAKER_09]: because it was so dark in there and the
blue, the blue shades just like lighten
[SPEAKER_09]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'm definitely, uh, I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_09]: What, uh, where are you from Alex?
Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for, thanks a lot for having
me on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm humbled to be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all you guys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is going to be an awesome
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Alex makes a, um, uh, a stainless steel
hash maker, uh, called the hashtag and
[SPEAKER_09]: they have a bunch of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure he could tell us about it in a
little bit here for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, the world needs
more hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the more hash, the merrier needs more,
um, companies sort of pushing these
[SPEAKER_09]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you get, uh, you get a pioneer
like, like, JP who sort of pioneers a
[SPEAKER_09]: concept, but then you get all these other
people who come along and they're just,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're, they want to, they want to fit in
there somehow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they start playing around and
changing in, you know, so it's like we
[SPEAKER_09]: stand on the shoulders of giants,
uh, when we're not insecure, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: and worried that, uh, people doing similar
things than what we're doing is taking
[SPEAKER_09]: away from our pie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last I heard John made enough for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, whose music is on someone playing
fucking theme music or what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was while we were talking about him
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that you were setting a,
setting a tone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladies are watching a movie here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the timing was so good, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really just this like perfect theme
music.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone playing theme music.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about legends about the
first legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how did that materialize?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that something that you sat down and
consciously created or did it happen more
[SPEAKER_05]: or less organically to a point where you
saw it happen and you were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to, we need to continue this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like everything that's awesome in
our community, it was created by skunk man
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was a part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were, we were having that conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't say, listen, first of all,
this guy's hash when he was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: okay, who the fuck lived in all the hash
producing countries, collected all the
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars, brought them back to his
greenhouse with federal licensing and bred
[SPEAKER_09]: genetics for 15 years straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who, who, who is puffing weed and saying
that that is how they got the weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that is just like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the start.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the first time I ever went over to
his place and I remember Rob Clark kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: be like, Oh, I can barely walk home from
Sam's last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was, I was so fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would kind of be like, well,
it's really man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I can drive on four grams of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like how stoned could you have possibly
been?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was kind of young bucking it,
being all fucking confident and cocky.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like, whatever, dude,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I ended up getting invited over
there one time finally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he, you know, he pulled out this,
this skunk number one, full melt dry sift
[SPEAKER_09]: that he's cleaned up to perfection.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was, uh, I'd never seen hash melt
like that, not even six star.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this was like another level.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like right through the screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and he's just like, also puffing,
like I'd say he puffed about 150 bowls in
[SPEAKER_09]: the, in the three hours that I hung out
there for.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I smoked this hash, it was like,
someone strapped me to a rocket and I took
[SPEAKER_09]: off and I was so anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I was going to shit myself,
throw up, piss myself, pass out
[SPEAKER_09]: unconscious, all the big four fears that
you would have if you got like,
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I, I'd gotten people high like
that before, but no one had ever gotten me
[SPEAKER_09]: high like that before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was humbled.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, and that was the first rep he gave
me like, I want to say 20 or 30 more.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I left his house that night,
the whole right side of my body wasn't
[SPEAKER_09]: working and I was walking and I was kind
of lifting my right leg and then walking
[SPEAKER_09]: normal with my left leg.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm being very serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_09]: In any way, shape or form, I was
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I finally understood what Rob was
saying like, oh yeah, I got really,
[SPEAKER_09]: really high at, at Sam's really high at
Sam's could mean that he gave you a goo
[SPEAKER_09]: ball with one gram of his dry sift in the
goo ball.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he'd eat two of those and go walk
around for Queens day in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just like, dude, like two of
those would knock any normal human being
[SPEAKER_09]: out for about 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that was the basis for the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've talked a little bit about this
before when, you know, alcohol went into
[SPEAKER_09]: bars and you had your laborers going and
drinking and those conversations they had
[SPEAKER_09]: really sort of shaped the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that turned into tea houses where now
they were more intellectual people getting
[SPEAKER_09]: together, not so much laborers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they started having conversations that
started shaping the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then coffee came in and coffee was all
about productivity and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those conversations shaped the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And made us much more productive and much
more efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the conversation that they're the most
scared for us to have, which is why in all
[SPEAKER_09]: of these states and countries where
there's legal cannabis, there's very few
[SPEAKER_09]: places to actually smoke it like actual
lounges.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because once we get that and that's what
hash churches and everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, hash church is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like really hash church is just a
place where you let people who use
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis have conversation and direct
their communities with that conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will have that when we eventually
can have these gatherings.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's the basis and the
foundation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I might have started it by
saying to Sam, you know, the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_09]: has a lot of people back then as well that
were just pissed off at high times and
[SPEAKER_09]: upset with high times.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was always kind of like,
listen, like, I think your expectations
[SPEAKER_09]: are too high.
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that they're making this happen
and we can come here and we can all meet
[SPEAKER_09]: up and filter out the people you don't
want to know, but meet these amazing
[SPEAKER_09]: people that were like, otherwise we're
hiding from the police in every state and
[SPEAKER_09]: country that they lived in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they were just outing themselves
at the cannabis cup with video cameras and
[SPEAKER_09]: cameras.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just, it was absolutely mental,
but there was a lot of people that I was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, I don't, a lot of people just
smoking cigarettes and just kind of being
[SPEAKER_09]: like, Oh, I wish I could run all these
heads through my bags and just collect the
[SPEAKER_09]: 90 micron heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will be the, you know,
this gathering that we would have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was what the conversation started
with me and Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was probably 60 dabs in and I was
probably 15 or 20 dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And absolutely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're like, Oh, if we could just
run everyone through the high times cup
[SPEAKER_09]: through our bags, man, and catch them all
in the 90, like just bakery talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it turned into legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: It turned into, you know, keep in mind
those guys at the time too, were very
[SPEAKER_09]: removed from the community and the scene.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they were a part of it, but they were
also like, they knew the only way they
[SPEAKER_09]: could get what they were going to do done
would be if they isolated themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people that were on the other
side of things, those guys, those guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning Sam and your sort of farm horde of
farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be Rob Clark, David Pate,
Michael, rich skunk man, Sam, and you
[SPEAKER_09]: know, Michael, David Pate was the chemist
who did all the chemistry work,
[SPEAKER_09]: but they, they were doing things that we
started doing in like the late 2000s,
[SPEAKER_09]: like the 2010s and the 2015s, they were
doing it in like the eighties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, and doing it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so because of that, they were always,
you know, there was always, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: those guys are like, they're the,
they're the DEA.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the CIA.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were all these rumors that Sam was a
DEA agent and then a CIA agent.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I first went in 95, I remember
someone pointing them out across the
[SPEAKER_09]: street and saying that guy's a CIA agent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I was like, Oh my God,
like, Whoa, crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as I got to know him and invited
into his circle, he's a very private man
[SPEAKER_09]: and meeting his wife of like, I don't
know, 35 or 40 years or something,
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they've been together for 50 years
now, very long time, seeing all the old
[SPEAKER_09]: photos, hearing all the old stories and
seeing how the, you know, Sam's Selejny
[SPEAKER_09]: was his, was the name that he originally,
originally picked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was because he back in the
sixties, when he was a big acid head and a
[SPEAKER_09]: big tripper, they all called him jingles
and jingles backwards is Selejny.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to think that all these other people
were like, he's a CIA agent, but then to
[SPEAKER_09]: go to go to his house and hear him and his
wife, chuckling about it, like,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're just like, Oh my God, like,
you know, and being able to meet and
[SPEAKER_09]: become friends with his wife and hearing
the stories from her perspective,
[SPEAKER_09]: she's such a sweet and honest and really
wonderful woman.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no fibbery.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no lies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still these stories going
around to this day that this guy is in the
[SPEAKER_09]: DEA, because what did he do?
[SPEAKER_09]: He did what no one else in Amsterdam could
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got a license to have and grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he had a DEA export license so he
could send it to different labs in
[SPEAKER_09]: different countries for them to do the
redundancy work, to test against the work
[SPEAKER_09]: that they were doing in their lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause back in the day, the standards for
THC and cannabinoids were super sketched
[SPEAKER_09]: out and they weren't well done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he, they all, he had to create his own
standards, if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically that was the conversation
that started Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, you know, they were very removed
and he was kind of like, well,
[SPEAKER_09]: do you think you could sell 50 tickets?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, and here I am going,
dude, I don't think you realize what the
[SPEAKER_09]: community really thinks of you and Rob and
the work that you've done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you guys are fucking rock stars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was kind of up to me by him
allowing me in and to kind of come under
[SPEAKER_09]: and be mentored by him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He also gave me permission in that sense
to shine a light on him and Rob and the
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana botany and the hashish and all
these, I was just like, these guys have
[SPEAKER_09]: done it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they weren't sure that we could
sell the tickets, but they did have a
[SPEAKER_09]: restaurant, a good friend of both of Rob's
and Sam's by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: The name of Simone, good friend of all of
ours now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he owned a restaurant called the
Artiste in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a Lebanese restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember being there before Legends
and we would go there and David or Sam
[SPEAKER_09]: would bring his bong and we would
basically puff bowls in this guy's
[SPEAKER_09]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was, and people would get,
there'd be Dutch people in the restaurant
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of getting mad about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he would kick them out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd be like, look, if you don't like it,
you know, get the fuck out, which was just
[SPEAKER_09]: like amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: To us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just like, listen, if we ever do
throw a party, it has to be at Simone's
[SPEAKER_09]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Simone's restaurant was small and the
ceiling was low and it was very,
[SPEAKER_09]: it got very smoky, very fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is part of the reason why we
always through the rest, through the party
[SPEAKER_09]: at Simone's through that money and that
business his way, because he was so
[SPEAKER_09]: righteous and he, he was a non puffer that
stood behind puffers in a way that very
[SPEAKER_09]: few non puffers ever have, you know,
putting his license on the, on the line,
[SPEAKER_09]: putting his whole restaurant like,
yeah, you can smoke bong rips after your
[SPEAKER_09]: meal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we ended up, you know, creating the
first laminants we created.
[SPEAKER_09]: We rented the restaurant out and I
basically went out and basically trade,
[SPEAKER_09]: sold Legends of hash tickets to anyone
that would show me a beautiful piece of
[SPEAKER_09]: hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured, you know what, this isn't about
status.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't about who you are in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't about going and promising DNA
12 tickets, and then going and giving Soma
[SPEAKER_09]: his 16 for his entourage.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about bringing in people who loved
hashish regardless of who they were.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only real prejudice was that you
had to show me a beautiful piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was interesting back in the day
because people were like, Oh, how much do
[SPEAKER_09]: I give you?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, you don't give me any,
you know, I thought like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_09]: of course I wanted the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have loved to have been like,
Oh, you, you know, you give me 10 grams
[SPEAKER_09]: and then, then, then, then you,
then you can come to Legends.
[SPEAKER_09]: So right from the get-go, there was this
temptation to bastardize the integrity of
[SPEAKER_09]: the, of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right from the start, which I refuse to
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, plus I'm not hurting for hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I've got lots.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just, I would smell the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't even often dab it, but if I
looked at it and smelled it and felt it,
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, you know what that,
that will gain you entry to buy a ticket.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then you ended up with these,
there was always one or two that snuck in
[SPEAKER_09]: and got, you know, got in when they really
shouldn't have got in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those people turned white very early
on left the building.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were out of there within an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Abuse to the greatest level.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is where you take people like
Jameson who like, Oh yeah, I abuse hash
[SPEAKER_09]: every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you'll be higher than you've ever
fucking been after legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the facts.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the highest I've ever been in my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of the, the basis of what
I set up legends for, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam turned it into a contest and that's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it was, I think that's why it
survived.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this sort of got to be this,
this level of self preservation and self
[SPEAKER_09]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_09]: There has to be for people to really get
into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I will say for a long time,
you know, legends was just this elusive
[SPEAKER_09]: event.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't try to make it a hard to get
ticket.
[SPEAKER_09]: The hash heads just grew in the early
days.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were less of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course there was no cameras allowed
because some of the people at the first
[SPEAKER_09]: legends were very, very, very,
very hardcore people doing the good work
[SPEAKER_09]: of getting the hash out all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And North America, and that was very
illegal work back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: dealing with, with cartels basically to
buy this hash in certain countries and
[SPEAKER_09]: then trying to move it around all around.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys were like, this was one of the
first times they got to have a party and
[SPEAKER_09]: enjoy hash because they had to be
invisible in the real world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to have like three or four of those
guys at the first legends, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: the nose from Amsterdam, if any of you
have been to Amsterdam, you got to know
[SPEAKER_09]: the nose, the nose, that's Steve Hayes.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was out front at one point,
pale white, big hashish guy in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was pale.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, wow, did you smoke too
much?
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, no, man, I looked around the
room and realized who was in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he was only one, one of the only
people who really understood who was at
[SPEAKER_09]: the first legends of hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that came through one of our friends
who's since passed away.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just happened to know all these
different guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I guess he was, you know,
kind of involved in those things for,
[SPEAKER_09]: for, for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me, there's no shame in that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I wanted to legends to pay homage to
that the same way I wanted to pay homage
[SPEAKER_09]: to the Terp slurpers and the temp text and
the Terp timers and all of these new
[SPEAKER_09]: things that we've done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to always hold a root or an
anchor in the foundation of legends.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even going way far back before these
guys were smuggling hash around the world,
[SPEAKER_09]: but going even hundreds of years further
to the Sufis and to these different
[SPEAKER_09]: Afghani gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, these storylines of
different people that have been promoting
[SPEAKER_09]: and using hashish for all of these
centuries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to stay rooted in that and
pay homage to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you become part of the legends of
hashish, it's really where old meets new.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to not necessarily in the
cannabis industry, it's always division,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe that's just in life in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always like, Oh, I only smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only smoke full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's just every little piece is
divided and divisive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at legends, you could be like,
yeah, I smoke my dabs, but I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_09]: hit that 110 year old hubbly bubbly that
Sam's dumping a gram and a half of his 60%
[SPEAKER_09]: gland heads into.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was pretty special.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one and everyone since then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have zero doubts that Los Angeles
will not be beyond anything that we've
[SPEAKER_09]: ever done because there's a team.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Addison and Kevin and a whole team
of people doing what I just couldn't do on
[SPEAKER_09]: my own.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys, the sponsors are a part of
that team.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very glad to be sharing bowls with
you here on a Sunday, on a Sunday morning
[SPEAKER_09]: on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the first legends that Sam turned
it into a competition or did that happen
[SPEAKER_05]: after?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think it happened pretty much
right there, you know, and it was
[SPEAKER_09]: brilliant from Sam's perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of like, look, I, I,
I earned this and you know, people,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think part of the first legends,
no doubt, part of the first many legends
[SPEAKER_09]: was just being in a room with Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was that elusive to be able to just be
in a room with Sam and, and then see him
[SPEAKER_09]: as like a, as a excited small child on
Christmas morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Sam's a very serious guy,
very much like that sort of like beyond
[SPEAKER_09]: serious professor that just knows
everything that you can't ever get it
[SPEAKER_09]: right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he's already done it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, the way he used to call
people out and the way he, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it was hard, it was hard being under his
wing those first years, but as legends
[SPEAKER_09]: progressed and as he started having fun
and just really doing what he loved.
[SPEAKER_09]: And trust me, this guy loves puffing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the fact that people would call him a
DEA agent or a CIA agent when really,
[SPEAKER_09]: truly he was the, the biggest cannabis
warrior I've ever, I've never met a guy
[SPEAKER_09]: that is more excited about cannabis and
more importantly, less excited about who
[SPEAKER_09]: makes the profit off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He never cared from the day that I met
him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I just want it to be legal and
available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone else can fight about who gets to
make the money.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you know that about Sam,
and that's not something he posted a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: online, but when you know that about him,
you know that it would make no sense for
[SPEAKER_09]: him to go around and rat people out when
he's truly, I don't know anyone that loves
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis more than this guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he doesn't love it in a way that's
going to just pay him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just, he's really like in the,
in the truest form.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he's done a lot for our community.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of us are, you know, dabbing on
these full melts, thanks to some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: work that that guy did.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I won't go on forever about Sam,
but he's a big part of Legends of Hashi.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's one of the founders and yeah,
he's just done.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I wanted to, uh, welcome Sam with a
show and, and, uh, rods and tech and dab
[SPEAKER_14]: nation and focus and all the stuff and Sam
and, uh, Drew's there with them as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonder fit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I welcome those guys at focus V's they're
labeled there, but, um, definitely
[SPEAKER_14]: wouldn't be able to put a lot of the stuff
we did for the gift bags and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_14]: judges kits and stuff without,
uh, without those guys' help as well as
[SPEAKER_14]: support.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to say, what's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: How you been?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting baked with friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: What up, Drew?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Kev?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go and take a, take a dab with
the Sabre and the, uh, the Carta too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to show the people what was up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love the Sabre, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told, uh, I told Addison to send me a
Carta cause T Beasel doesn't like,
[SPEAKER_05]: he drives like a maniac and he doesn't
stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, unless you have a rig to smoke in
the car, you're, you're, you're waiting in
[SPEAKER_02]: a cup holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm, I'm, I'm looking forward to
having one for the trip.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of the benefits of using a,
uh, a device like this that's designed by
[SPEAKER_14]: a company that actually makes salt attach.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's.
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually very grateful for you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a little different, you know,
not very, very pleased to have you guys
[SPEAKER_14]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew rips a slurper.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what I love about you guys is
that you're not against that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you understand that the Carta is
a tool that's used, you know, within our
[SPEAKER_14]: day and, and, you know, in between
transitionally between things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not like, you know, you're all
against, you know, using a slurper or
[SPEAKER_14]: using anything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, you guys are about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a lot of glass in my day to day,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll smoke a hot knife right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I just, I just like getting
high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I'm not, I can tell you telling
the truth because I see that titanium
[SPEAKER_05]: nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you got a mini nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an email.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we used to, uh, while we still make
them, we, we make emails.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so yeah, titanium since day one,
man, you know, it's always ready,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, it's always on, you know,
I, I hear a lot about, um, like
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature regulation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that, you know,
my thought process always was with the
[SPEAKER_12]: nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm interested to ask some of you guys
that are at the very top end of this is,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the way, the way this email
works is it's constantly taking the
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature of, um, you know, the,
the nail and then it's constantly
[SPEAKER_12]: modulating how much power it's giving you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when the temperature drops,
the power goes up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now it's staying at a perfect
500.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even as like the air conditioning and
stuff kicks on, I can see it dropping and
[SPEAKER_12]: changing and it changes how much power.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I'm drawing on it, when I'm
ripping it, um, it throttles up the power
[SPEAKER_12]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it really keeps it a consistent
temperature the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see like, you know, him with the
banger, as soon as he starts drawing on
[SPEAKER_12]: it, it's changing the temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like from the start of the dab
to the end of the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty, it's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when you start pulling the air cools
it down pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dab cools it down pretty quickly too,
before you even pull.
[SPEAKER_09]: You drop that dab on there and you're,
you're cooling things down substantially.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every sub and every compound like
releases and holds heat differently.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, the quartz ability for
thermal shock is very unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, you know, you dip hot sapphire
into any liquid or even use like a Q-tip
[SPEAKER_09]: with ISO and you can crack the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super delicate, but the way it
releases heat is just a little more
[SPEAKER_09]: preservative than quartz.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not quite enough to warranty paying like
$600 for a sapphire thing that's going to
[SPEAKER_09]: break almost every time you try to clean
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, I do find it very interesting
that, uh, there's a whole science.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could get a PhD on this of just how
different substances release and retain
[SPEAKER_09]: heat and how that either preserves or
destroys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll say volatile organic compounds
because we're not just talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the flavor profiles that we love
the most are thiols and they're very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very small percentages, but they really
do, you know, throw the smell and flavor
[SPEAKER_09]: profile to a great angle with a,
with a very, very, very small amount.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that they have such small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't give them as much credit as where
credit is due, but I mean, skunk for
[SPEAKER_09]: instance, is definitely a combination of
two or three thiols and butane thiol one,
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe is one of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, let's not forget our thiols when
we're talking about our volatile organic
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good point.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone else is trying to
do this, but I've been trying to keep up
[SPEAKER_14]: with JP.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: He just, I've been literally ahead of me,
but I've been like trying to just,
[SPEAKER_14]: cause coming into this, I was like,
all right, I'm going to pick somebody and
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to, you know, that's,
that's how I'll take my dad's.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's who you pick JP.
[SPEAKER_14]: I picked fucking JP.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for Christ's sake, I'm two behind me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I got a funny story.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me and Kevin went to dinner with Debbie
and we went over to what's up Mikey's
[SPEAKER_14]: house and, uh, yeah, we were all there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was Jay from, uh, professor
stiff.
[SPEAKER_14]: A bunch of us all go to dinner and we get
there and Mikey's got the table just laid
[SPEAKER_14]: out like an M on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just splashed out with every, you know,
the illest of the craziest shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all start dabbing and I didn't
notice it till later.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kevin noticed it, but Debbie was hitting
every single rig and he went through while
[SPEAKER_14]: we were there and dabbed every single rig
and then started going back through the
[SPEAKER_14]: rigs.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gauntlet, he did the gauntlet all the
way through and was coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did 11 and they went.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I, the first time I met
Debbie was at mothership two years ago and
[SPEAKER_05]: Addison took me there and Debbie ran the
hash competition at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we started late.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did 52 dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He served them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: He cleaned every banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did every banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we finished, he started up a
ping pong tournament that went for no less
[SPEAKER_05]: than three hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with all the people that were
watching that weren't dabbing while the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the dabbers were just like sitting
at that table recovering.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was literally playing ping pong within
a minute of finishing the comp and
[SPEAKER_05]: announcing and announcing the winners.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like dude is he's a wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, we had a video game system that had,
uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Street fighter too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's played as Chun Li and wrecked
every person in the room shit out of all
[SPEAKER_03]: the gauntlet on wrecking us all in Chun
Li.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then went back and then I wound up
beating him the second time by like a
[SPEAKER_03]: hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's some skunk man Sam shit
right there for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the legends, some of the legends
were like 30 to 40 entries and we'd have
[SPEAKER_09]: to smoke them all in a couple of hours,
you know, and this one in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_09]: which was at certified, uh, when flux was
a part of it, flux kind of got us in there
[SPEAKER_09]: and we were in this crazy back room that
looked like Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was holes in the floor and the walls
were all gnarly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just like, I'll never forget
that group of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flux was at the table and Rick Delisi was
at the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flav was at the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and we just went through Ramon was at
the table, just went through like,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, 40 plus, uh, entries,
uh, smoking one dab after another.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a gauntlet of gauntlets.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to love gauntlets.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the tech at the time?
[SPEAKER_14]: What was like the tech at the time?
[SPEAKER_14]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, uh, titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, this was, this was 2016.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were definitely hitting out of
courts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were definitely hitting out of courts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no, uh, titanium nails on that
table.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do people really hate on titanium nails?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like am I really jamming up the program?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, this is this.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And no problem is Instagram has created an
enormous amount of fuck boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, the fuck boy thing is,
oh, you're hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about using all these
different surfaces to, to keep the same
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm watching this thing when it's ambient
right now, it's 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I'm ripping it like full bore,
it only drops to 480.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's just the temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you did the same thing out of a quartz
banger side by side, you'd notice the
[SPEAKER_09]: preservation of the volatile organic
compounds would be different.
[SPEAKER_09]: The, when it hits the titanium,
even at that low temperature, it's not the
[SPEAKER_09]: same as when it hits courts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has nothing to do with the
temperature as much as the, the component
[SPEAKER_09]: that you're hitting off of.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all are different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Titanium generally is looked at as kind of
one of the first ones that, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: branded many of us, many of us wear our
titanium brands for life, uh, on our arms
[SPEAKER_09]: and on our wherever's, but, but then
people say, you know, like, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's kind of like this, you know,
it's, it's real, but it's also like built
[SPEAKER_09]: up like people that don't even know will
watch this and suddenly be like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh yeah, man, I would never hit off a
titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hit off a titanium nail if I
didn't have a quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I didn't have a quartz or a titanium
nail, I'd hit off a pen or I'd hit off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just thought it's about how the hash
moves.
[SPEAKER_14]: The hash moves differently on courts in a
way that it can't move on titanium because
[SPEAKER_14]: titanium slows it down where if you allow
it to move, it can hit more surface area
[SPEAKER_14]: and vaporize more quickly, more evenly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's quartz has that, that quality
other to move more quickly and dance
[SPEAKER_14]: around that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, the cap is adding spin
and everything else to push it in
[SPEAKER_14]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're trying to make it move.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to vaporize as much as we can
and get a good hit and keep temp because
[SPEAKER_14]: temp is good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is important part.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can add pearls for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do other things for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like, you know, that,
that all kind of comes to the picture,
[SPEAKER_14]: the, but the email has its fucking place.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got a bunch of people coming
over, light them up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's like, yo, I'm not going to
sit here and fucking.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not trying to argue anybody,
but like, I mean, we take all that into
[SPEAKER_12]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like this cap is rifled.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you pull the air through it's
spinning, it's designed to spin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we, we did all kinds of airflow
simulations and stuff when we designed
[SPEAKER_12]: this nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, I don't know,
like I, I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to rock the boat.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they work, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're definitely not rocking the boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, it's an Instagram fuck boy
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you posted, you know, it's just someone
would jump on that shit in an,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, he's fucking puffing off a titanium
nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, fuck you too.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd also fucking bitch at you if your
hash was too dark.
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't take it with a grain of salt,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's whatever you're puffing out of
is perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to travel in a different
direction, listen, everyone in this room,
[SPEAKER_09]: I would almost guarantee has puffed off of
a titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, I have puffed off many a
fucking stainless steel knives,
[SPEAKER_09]: hot knifing, you know, probably even
alloys and Coke cans and all this other
[SPEAKER_09]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a screen on a D-nail titanium nail,
like back in the day doing that screen
[SPEAKER_03]: tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best hits back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That allows a lot of, yeah, no,
it is good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's the hardest part about
D-nails and I think what kicked their ass
[SPEAKER_14]: or the electric nails that you couldn't
really bring them in the car unless you
[SPEAKER_14]: had something correct for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, you know, but everything has its
fucking purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if I show up somewhere and all
they have is X, we're using X.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's a fucking, that doesn't
matter at all at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what's great about hash too is that
you can do it so many different ways,
[SPEAKER_14]: but no, shut out to the, I mean,
just remember when we were towards and
[SPEAKER_14]: then the D-nails came out, the electric
nails came out, how fucking much that
[SPEAKER_14]: changed the game.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like how, you know, when you went to a
session, now it was like, we're all
[SPEAKER_14]: getting fucking lit in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's like that changed the
fucking game.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it definitely still has its home.
[SPEAKER_14]: It has its place.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, you know, the internet,
everyone's at different levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was all Sam before dear
Michael, before any of that, it was Sam
[SPEAKER_09]: that turned me onto those screens.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, how I met Sam, was someone told
me that he used a new screen for every
[SPEAKER_09]: single bowl that he puffed out of.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he'd like soak these screens and get
the coating off of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he had a big bag of brand new
screens, like a thousand of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he'd just walk around and you could,
the first time I went to the PAX party
[SPEAKER_09]: house, I saw screens and matches like on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if he stood anywhere, even for like
five minutes, there'd be like 50 matches
[SPEAKER_09]: and like 10 or 15 screens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was like, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, I remember picking one up and
realizing he's not even finishing these.
[SPEAKER_09]: The hash is melted into the screen.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's, I was just like, this is not how
I'm going to try his hash for the first
[SPEAKER_09]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I threw it back down, but I definitely
saw people picking those up and hitting
[SPEAKER_09]: them and being like, that was the best
hash that I hit in Amsterdam was the
[SPEAKER_09]: screens that I picked up at the PAX party
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of how fucking mental that is dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I found him on the third floor with his
fucking Birkenstock sandals on,
[SPEAKER_09]: which was another look for the guy in the
Birkenstock sandals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of, yeah, sort of met him
and walked over.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was very, you know, standoffish and it
took a little while.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't until he found out that I used
his saying, if it don't bubble,
[SPEAKER_09]: it ain't worth the trouble for the bubble
bag company that he reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_09]: was like, do you know who I am?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really how we ended up linking
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank God, because without Sam and his
hash and all that, like many, many decades
[SPEAKER_09]: of work that he did, we would not be
having the legends of hash in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true in the next month.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can thank Sam for that too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So true.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We needed to talk about actually reaching
out to him and getting him to say hello to
[SPEAKER_14]: us during the event, if we could.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know if we'll get to see
him.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll probably get to see Dr. Seuss.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no one gets to see him.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's elusive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very elusive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very secretive man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's definitely, I can't, I really
can't wait to see what's entered this year
[SPEAKER_14]: because I've kind of started to get a bit
of an understanding.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys don't know, we have a
blockchain that we're going to be using
[SPEAKER_14]: for the judging so that everything's on
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it allows us to have a ability to see
all the judging in real time, but then to
[SPEAKER_14]: be able to publish everything afterward in
case anyone tries to say somebody bought a
[SPEAKER_14]: win.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, it makes it impossible to do
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyhow, that whole system is there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all put together and now we need to
understand what some of the strain names
[SPEAKER_14]: are because they're putting together the
program that's going to be able to allow
[SPEAKER_14]: us to do this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So some guys have been sending us some
information on what their entries might be
[SPEAKER_14]: and what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is definitely going to be a
fucking wild, wild.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kev, how many entries is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: 63, 62 or 63.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere in that vicinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say just north of 60.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in order to, in order to land the
plane, you know, like touchdown and be
[SPEAKER_14]: able to get everything moving forward,
we really have to have 41 makers instead
[SPEAKER_14]: of 40 because if somebody backs out or you
have to have a couple more makers just in
[SPEAKER_14]: case because things always happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this year it was at 41 makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's last year, I think we had 24
makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you never know really where that number
is going to fall either right below or
[SPEAKER_14]: just above.
[SPEAKER_14]: But this year we're able to, you know,
because of the contingency and how it went
[SPEAKER_14]: through, we have 41 makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we'll be posting an update of
the new list on Monday.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll show, you know, all corrections
and all the, and who all the makers are.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but what that means is that,
you know, now you have what Mark,
[SPEAKER_14]: like what Marcus was talking about,
you have legends, you know, you're able to
[SPEAKER_14]: have a lot of hash there, you know,
from different types of hash there because
[SPEAKER_14]: you have so many makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody like, Hey, the next,
the next, for the next hour, you guys can
[SPEAKER_14]: buy tickets.
[SPEAKER_14]: These are all 250 selected people from our
industry, from the hash industry,
[SPEAKER_14]: from the glass industry that are,
you know, very, very, very into hash and
[SPEAKER_14]: about the culture and want to be there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of one of the cool things
too, is that it's all selected people that
[SPEAKER_14]: are there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see old friends, you'll see new
friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the, the idea of having
makers from the East coast to be able to
[SPEAKER_14]: sit down with makers from the West coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know there's other events that do
this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, obviously, but to have it in this
environment, in this setting and have it
[SPEAKER_14]: be a part of this event, you know,
the best people, the best hash,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and all the best company.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, yeah, it should be, you know,
great food, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of, we just went, we wanted to
go overboard on every little bit from the
[SPEAKER_14]: gift bags to the sponsors, to the venue,
to everything that's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: We want people to just be like,
Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and it's, and it's, we run a
lower risk of having a blowout with like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the wrong kind of people
together or, you know, taking a chance on
[SPEAKER_14]: like, Oh, this, this guy is going to have
an issue or something else.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we've really gone through and made
sure that it's a great mix of people
[SPEAKER_14]: coming together, people that have known
each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and, you know, and then there's some
young companies, there's some new
[SPEAKER_14]: companies, some new guys, cause you always
got to be able to give a, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: give respect to somebody who's,
who's doing it and just elevated
[SPEAKER_14]: themselves because their stuff's so good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, you know, there's some of those guys
in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, catch these complaints from
people being like, Oh, I should be on that
[SPEAKER_14]: list.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, there's 40 dudes on that list
that I'm better than.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like, yeah, but maybe just this
wasn't your year to be a guy of that level
[SPEAKER_14]: coming into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we have to cap it at
something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, let's give everyone the
respect.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, but, you know, there's always people
who, instead of, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_14]: the anger that comes from not being
involved comes out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's, it's, you know, it just is what it
is, but there's a lot less of that than
[SPEAKER_13]: there is people just hitting us up and
being super stoked.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, everyone fucking fired up
for this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So about the glass, Addy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, the whole, I mean,
what's great is that you do have
[SPEAKER_14]: mothership bringing, you know,
the heat always.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Scott's always got something crazy
up his sleeve, but we got lucky enough
[SPEAKER_14]: where this is the cheesy one drop,
the Hareem drop.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, you know, hat very hash specific
art, art specific and culturally specific.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of cool to have that at
legends and to have them be willing to,
[SPEAKER_14]: to put that there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then, you know, JP is coming.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know he's bringing some great glass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a, you know, task is
sending stuff out from highly educated.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, you know, Dom is going to come
and do a cap drop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And his stuff is just always, you know,
so solvent list, perfect, specific,
[SPEAKER_14]: great stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have like slurper sets and
different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, a lot of glass and then
just people with glass on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's going to be quite a bit of
heaters, you know, cause of who's invited
[SPEAKER_14]: and what they have for a collection.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, so yeah, but I think
tomorrow we get to see some of the first
[SPEAKER_14]: sneak peeks of the cheesy one drop.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll, we'll have a little better
understanding of some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we've been trying to look at the
sponsor list and give Scott ideas and give
[SPEAKER_14]: those guys ideas of like any way we can
lend to, you know, what we know that crowd
[SPEAKER_14]: is going to be really into so that we have
a lot of great stuff there that way.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then there's also, you know,
the art component, you know, having lot
[SPEAKER_14]: there and, you know, Mike be there and
have him be able to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: share, you know, his whole take on the
culture and deliver what he does.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of a cool ass fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there'll be some surprises that pop up
for everybody to enjoy there that kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: come from Mike and come from lot comedy.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Mace?
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe, it's Greg.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're also going to have a seed
breeders lounge where we'll have four seed
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders who work specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making genetics for hash production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll have a lounge with the four
breeders and Masonic is going to be one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_14]: Valley and Ross Kyle with Northwest roots.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll have some of their genetic stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rare us genomics out of Texas,
which is a really cool story and a cool
[SPEAKER_14]: ass group of cats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll have their own lounge,
which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know these guys all dab super hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you wanted to give them an area where
people could come in and sit down and kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of hang out with the breeders and check
out their gear and be able to kind of swap
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's hashtag.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have a unit there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a, which we'll have an a
series 58 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been our best-selling unit kind of
bridges the gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between craft producers and large scale
license license production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to show that off to the boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the unit Alex, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it tip or is it stationary?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is the tabletop version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this show we're real excited
about sponsoring Kelly and I, my partner
[SPEAKER_00]: who we started the company with,
we're both going to be down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like with, with Jameson's lead
melting of the heads, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we really want to get out of legends
is talking to hash makers and seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: list of hash makers that were there that
are coming this year, it's very impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: and prestigious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we're going to make our
equipment better is getting feedback from
[SPEAKER_00]: hash makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's really what we look
forward to for legends.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really agree with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that was pretty important
to us about being a part of legends as a
[SPEAKER_12]: sponsor was.
[SPEAKER_12]: Getting feedback.
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we do a lot on the cultivation side
and we work with a lot of large scale
[SPEAKER_12]: facilities and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as of late, we're starting to see a
lot of, a lot of focus on like temperature
[SPEAKER_12]: control and stuff in the room while the
wash process is going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: When, you know, we were with somebody on
the west coast and they were saying that
[SPEAKER_12]: they wanted different temperatures and
communities during different stages of the
[SPEAKER_12]: process, you know, when they're first
bringing in product, when they're,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, screening it different,
you know, things, whatever they wanted
[SPEAKER_12]: advanced environmental stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for us as equipment manufacturers,
as controls manufacturers, that's,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's really important feedback to get.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hash, the hash community is,
you know, usually the most demanding
[SPEAKER_12]: customers.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I think there's so much
innovation.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much hardware, there's so many
odds and ends and things to consume hash
[SPEAKER_12]: with is because hash makers are just very,
and hash users are just very demanding.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that type of feedback is really
valuable.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those type of producers that can
provide that type of feedback is really
[SPEAKER_12]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one thing I never really thought
about is the, is, you know, if you do have
[SPEAKER_14]: savvy sponsors that are taking,
you know, you know, they, they,
[SPEAKER_14]: they take the event seriously and they go
there with these, you know, with
[SPEAKER_14]: different, you know, objectives,
what some of those objectives are,
[SPEAKER_14]: because it is, you know, you do have an
opportunity to be in the room with that
[SPEAKER_14]: many people at that level and get that
feedback.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's probably the same for the
breeders, you know, to be there in the
[SPEAKER_14]: room with that many makers and kind of
have, you know, and that's like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, it tells me that we're doing it
correctly because now we are kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: curating that room in the right way.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, to make it add value to the,
to the sponsors, but then add as much
[SPEAKER_14]: value as possible for the makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause now they're getting heard by the,
you know, the guys that are making
[SPEAKER_14]: different products and putting things out
there for them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and then sometimes you see those guys
themselves kind of turn into that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if you look at simply Adam,
uh, with his dial, the resin dial,
[SPEAKER_14]: that new unit that he put together for a
test washing and kind of checking
[SPEAKER_14]: material.
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, it's, uh, it's always cool to see
the industry moving forward and just see
[SPEAKER_14]: it kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like legends is, uh,
you know, going to be to me, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: just a party, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, get to be in the room with all
these people, all these friends and all
[SPEAKER_14]: these different guys and, and then get to
eat great food and then the fucking hash
[SPEAKER_14]: alone.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, that's it's to simplify all
of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a party, you know, it's really just
the time to get together and put all that
[SPEAKER_14]: bullshit down and just fucking have fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, cause the FOMO is really going
to come from not being able to be in that
[SPEAKER_14]: party.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, you know, Marcus said,
when they walked around and they,
[SPEAKER_14]: and they gave out those lanyards,
you know, the laminates.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really hard to get one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to have great hash and you had to
kind of run into them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's still to this day, like legends
is it's, it's a tough ticket to get.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Kevin and I are sitting there with
like a great Rolodex of people that we
[SPEAKER_14]: know because we've been in the industry a
long time, but then they come out of the
[SPEAKER_14]: woodwork when legends comes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause everyone wants to be in that room
and be at that party.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what's, you know, we take it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the throw the best fucking party.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we get to make it two days because
we listened to the makers.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we listened to the feedback.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a little dark in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't get to have my phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt a little rushed, you know,
there was no judging.
[SPEAKER_14]: So who really won and, and, you know,
all those things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we had the opportunity to change that
stuff, to actually make it evolve.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you need the help of sponsors.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need the help of companies to come
forward and say, Hey, I want to get the
[SPEAKER_14]: value out of being in that room to get the
top.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk to just curate a list of
people and help push things forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, we're willing to exchange,
you know, w w you know, value for us that
[SPEAKER_14]: we can then use and turn into this event.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we really try not to spare any
expense.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we try to, you know, just the judge
kit boxes alone that you'll get as a
[SPEAKER_14]: judge, you know, for the makers that
they'll get that box alone is,
[SPEAKER_14]: is a piece of art.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's a really cool piece of art
that a ton of energy and effort went into
[SPEAKER_14]: creating.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then at a cost, you know, so it's,
we try to create all these things and
[SPEAKER_14]: it's, you know, Marcus and those guys
never monetized and never did anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have the website.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we have the e-commerce component and
that's the idea is to create, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: something that allows people to,
to, to, you know, to hold a piece of that
[SPEAKER_14]: culture and to, and to look more into it
and figure more about it and make it a
[SPEAKER_14]: part of like them and hash and the,
and, and build that community stronger and
[SPEAKER_14]: like put people together.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's not about like,
you know, if you don't get into legends
[SPEAKER_14]: this year, it doesn't mean you're not
getting into legend.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, you know, we're just getting
off the ground and we're, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: get it so that we can do maybe two events
a year in different places.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we always want to do it in LA.
[SPEAKER_14]: We feel like that's kind of the epicenter
of, you know, putting on things like that
[SPEAKER_14]: and making things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, a lot of people want to go
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's easy to go there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we, we, we're grateful for that
component, but you know, as we get it
[SPEAKER_14]: moving forward, we'll, you know,
the, we don't want to make it,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, me and Marcus agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, you know, Kevin says the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want to make it where there's too
much legends, you know, and that's what
[SPEAKER_14]: the website's for.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that, you know, when it's not a legend
event, you can go get a piece of merch or
[SPEAKER_14]: something from it and then be able to
represent and have it, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: be that rare product or something,
you know, it's, it's like, there is
[SPEAKER_14]: marketing involved in everything that we
do.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's sad that like, you know,
the heavy boy culture sometimes doesn't
[SPEAKER_14]: want you to monetize something,
but it's like, that's how things are
[SPEAKER_14]: innovated because people make money and
they can make things better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as long as the people are ethically
correct and they're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sky's the fucking limit,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can really push a lot of things and,
you know, make, make a lot more happen,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it's really just about a fucking
party, a fucking party.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I'm like super stoked.
[SPEAKER_14]: As we get closer to it, I get more excited
about that part.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of work, you know,
Kevin, I think we've got 11,000 jars from
[SPEAKER_14]: Calix and we had to, we had to cap and
build kits for 11,000 jars to go out to,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, 61 or 60, 63 kits going out to
these makers, you know, so that they're
[SPEAKER_14]: able to bring a uniform, a uniform
offering so that we're able to then put it
[SPEAKER_14]: out with, with standardized delivery to
every person that's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's, and there's a ton of problems
that we had to solve behind the scenes to
[SPEAKER_14]: make all of this stuff deliverable to the
culture and to put out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, an open hash bar and all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then using our friends, you know,
that, that helped design the blockchain
[SPEAKER_14]: and all those things to bring that into
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we had a call with mothership
the other day about the NFTs that
[SPEAKER_14]: mothership are going to drop at the event.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's relevant about that is that
every ticket is an NFT.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'll have a wallet.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be able to, you know, make the
agreement and get an NFT and start that
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of part of your, you know,
of your resume or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: The fuck you call it, like have that in
your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's kind of where things are going.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that NFT will allow you to,
you know, go to any one of the mothership
[SPEAKER_14]: parties and be a judge for the hash
competition and do these different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, salmon those
[SPEAKER_04]: directly to the consumer that you're
trying to market to that you have more
[SPEAKER_14]: information about that's part of a
community.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it ultimately makes it a lot more
easier.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Mace is fucking Jesus Christ when it
comes to discord and marketing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what it is, is it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_14]: To, you know, a younger crowd,
a more technically savvy crowd that knows
[SPEAKER_14]: how to use these things and wants to use
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, if you don't adjust and
have that in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the point is this year we do have the
NFT component.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of the stuff motherships bring in
with GZ is just going to be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if people are into NFTs and they're
coming, you know, have your wallet and all
[SPEAKER_14]: your stuff ready, have some go in there
and those things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, it's not going to limit
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is kind of opening the door to that
stuff, which is also, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's kind of like a whole
different approach, but it allows,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the judging and allows the
ticketing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It allows us to know who's going to be in
the building before they get there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, and like monitor
everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've kind of blows my mind that like,
this is now a part of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like a year ago, I didn't know
anything, you know, and now to see how we
[SPEAKER_14]: can integrate it and how it works and what
it can do.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's kind of fucking cool actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how much everybody's
ticket NFT.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is an NFT.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to create a wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all the couple of wallets created.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to send them out to everybody,
airdrop their ticket to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also an app that our
partners at Glass Flow has built.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that app is where the judging
portal is going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be event information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your ticket is going to be represented
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The NFT.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crypto curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, no, we're going to be,
it's about transparency, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the judging is fully transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and if it sounds daunting or like some
future shit or like whatever, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're setting everything up so it's
just very easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're all going to get an email and
it's going to tell you exactly how to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, access the app.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've built an app for this legitimately.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've put it on a blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done all of this to have a level of
transparency that you just don't get at
[SPEAKER_03]: events ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're really excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were able to do it because we're
almost ready to talk there, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we were able to do it because of
your sponsors.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We wouldn't be able to create that stuff
and have that stuff and incorporate that
[SPEAKER_14]: team without having sponsors and like the
bigger picture of what we put together.
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is possible because of you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're super grateful.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mace, what do you got planned,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_14]: You got some drops or anything or what do
you do?
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to go smoke hash and kick it
with the homies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got beans on me every day, but that's
the grand thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The grand scheme of legends is to go
party.
[SPEAKER_11]: You said, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, no, there's, I wasn't sure if
you had any drops or anything close to
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you know, I can sell some shit,
but I'm, you know, I want to go party,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, but I got some stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always got like, I'll probably bring in
the Wilson Femme S1 line with me,
[SPEAKER_11]: like straight Wilson Femme.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't dropped those yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I might dig in the ball, break out some,
uh, the sour diesels that won a couple
[SPEAKER_11]: cups here and there and break out some
award winning genetics, like straight up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, genetics that have either been
nominated to win an award, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: or, or like, you know, place or can be
showcased better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to bring out the heat to
the hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't expect anything less.
[SPEAKER_14]: My friend, we give you guys a nice lounge
area too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'd be able to dab and kind of sit
and chill with people as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So with it, with it, I'm looking forward
to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The food will be nuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a, the brunch is a prime rib
brunch.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they'll be cutting prime rib.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a coffee cart with, uh,
all the tasty coffee, everything,
[SPEAKER_14]: pastries, and you just session and eat and
fucking have fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, try to get every little amenity,
little, little bit that you can have in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So no doubt coffee is a hell of hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, espresso and hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no fucking, those two go hand in
hand right there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an adult may not be legends of
hashish branded coffee latte.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some cool shit they can do with
those now too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I need to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just took a huge dab right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you're saying it was
milky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, uh, I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be in there mixing it up with
all these guys smoking all the hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also overseeing all the cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: So add a little bit of a mix in,
uh, Kevin and Marcus, who's an incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: photographer have, uh, brought in three
camera videographers to shoot the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be really cool to be a
part of documenting something that was not
[SPEAKER_05]: allowed to be documented for so,
so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm super stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm incredibly excited about all the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of these makers are working
really hard on either securing or finding
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that last minute perfect entry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just incredibly stoked for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be able to, to, to like see what
happens once we put this out to the public
[SPEAKER_05]: more, cause this has been so behind the
scenes for so long, it's almost been lore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now to kind of showcase it,
document it and put it out and just really
[SPEAKER_05]: excited to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stoked on seeing some of that footage
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get that out here on bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be a pretty special
event for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been too long for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think that if we're going to represent
the culture, we need to represent the
[SPEAKER_03]: culture all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to, and the best way to do
that is to get that footage out and put it
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way that's palatable and catches
people's attention and, and lets them
[SPEAKER_03]: understand like the true prestige of the
legends of hashish and what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to build that FOMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want everybody to be like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to that party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want, I want, I want to provide
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want us to provide things for people
that like, when I was a kid and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: reading in high times going, fuck,
I want to go to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we're, we're,
we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're definitely, uh, definitely aiding
and abetting in the consumption of quite a
[SPEAKER_13]: bit of fucking hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good, uh, that's a good
foundation right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter what, as long as that's the
foundation, it can't collapse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: People's desires are what makes the world
spin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the desire to smoke and enjoy hash is,
uh, we'll look how fucking far we've taken
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're fucking measuring our bangers with
thermometers and, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: all of our bangers are specifically made
by people that are slurping turps and
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking banger, basketting and all this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really quite incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get that it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that we're a small group of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but it's kind of why I also look
forward to one day, someone designing the
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect micro dab unit, because we need to
turn people on to how great this is,
[SPEAKER_09]: but not with monster dabs, not even with a
normal size dab, not even with a small
[SPEAKER_09]: dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost killed somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you gotta, you gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it, it, it's what I'll be honest for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, it sort of speaks to the,
to our culture of these, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: heady boys, as Addison put it,
you know, the, the, the, the roots of that
[SPEAKER_09]: were let's destroy him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can take the biggest dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really was like this really
testosterone driven, like I can take a
[SPEAKER_09]: bigger dab than you and I'm going to
destroy you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I knocked countless people out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play devil's advocate to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, for me, I lose sight of
reality and what is a non-consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: acceptable dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just a generous sharing person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we were in, uh, British Columbia
together at an event and this really nice
[SPEAKER_05]: elderly lady was sitting with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We and Marcus and we were just dabbing and
this elderly lady was so nice and she's
[SPEAKER_05]: asking all these questions and talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: She asked me, she said, can I have a dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, and so like slurper, I go to like my
dab and I'm like, no, half that half that
[SPEAKER_05]: gin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I go to half Marcus looks over at
me and he's like, dude, is that for her?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, man, man, she's,
she's a delightful lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's just looking at, and she,
she's like, no, no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he like, he went and served her up one
of these micro dabs, which was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's left on my dad when I'm done
dabbing less.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and she was like, she loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had such a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: She, she asked him for another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I immediately realized, I was like,
Oh, that would have played out completely
[SPEAKER_05]: differently if Marcus were not to have
intervened.
[SPEAKER_14]: So all heroes don't wear.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it too many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did it too many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be honest too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I just thought it was great too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause when you get humbled and you're a
hardcore smoker, you want to go share that
[SPEAKER_09]: with other hardcore smokers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're out there looking to humble
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was also 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been doing this for more than 10
plus years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more interested in gently letting
people come into what we find is special
[SPEAKER_09]: about cannabis and these extracts and
bringing them in nice and gently and being
[SPEAKER_09]: like, listen, this is a real, this could
really get you as high as you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'd rather do is give you the tiniest
little bit, take away the fear,
[SPEAKER_09]: give you the taste, give you a bit of a
buzz.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's nice, you can always take
more, but you can never untake any.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you take a big half Jamison dab,
you can't untake it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be like uncomfortably high
for probably at least an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to babysit people that
end.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also don't want to knock people
unconscious anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hated it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Watching people hit the ground for thwomp.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not everybody who goes to the rodeo wants
to ride the bull.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it could be if you sedate the
bull and put them up there and go just
[SPEAKER_09]: take them for a short walk.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd be like, that is actually really
nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at his balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, because it doesn't have
to be a rocket ship to the moon.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can literally be like a couple of puffs
off a joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also enjoy the pleasure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of ninja dabbing the fuck out of somebody
with a giant dab that can handle it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Jamison.
[SPEAKER_14]: I never see anyone ninja dab Jamison and
he's a fucking Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's no need to ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's ninja dabbing himself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish there was more ninja dabbing.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I hope legends is like a
rebirth of ninja dabbing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Giving regular people like just like
random people off the street, like,
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, what is he doing over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Young man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: That requires a micro dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them to leave feeling super good
and having a good experience and being
[SPEAKER_09]: like, I'm going to look into this dabbing
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was quite pleasant.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to mention if you could get high off a
micro dab, can you imagine like that grams
[SPEAKER_09]: lasting Jamison, like seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lasting this woman like 42 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A month and three weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should get some special ninja
dabbers for legends made like that are
[SPEAKER_05]: given out during the, the, the
shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, those really long dabbers,
like a couple of sessions, some guys show
[SPEAKER_05]: up with them where it's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just like ninja dab a guy from
afar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I always go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to make sure now that I pick a
few volunteers that are just there to
[SPEAKER_14]: ninja dab people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be their job.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just be in the crowd and just
fucking, Oh, you're taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's another one.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that'll be, you know, a thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's kind of in the, it's almost
like it's in the, in the spirit of Sam
[SPEAKER_14]: because you know, Sam was like preloading
CBD and then fucking going out and dabbing
[SPEAKER_14]: with everyone and like, you know,
there's stories about Sam, about him and
[SPEAKER_14]: his like, you know, understanding of like
the endocannabinoid system and saturating
[SPEAKER_14]: a system with CBD and then going and
fucking like dabbing all these people out
[SPEAKER_14]: and actually being able to like use the
CBD as a barrier for the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: or the receptor so that he didn't get as
loaded as everybody else.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, yeah, this is in the spirit of
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's, Sam would be proud of us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to mention that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a prankster kind of a thing is like
the, the ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a jingles.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you could be like, I'm just busting
balls, bro, with the fucking 60
[SPEAKER_14]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the original.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just busting your balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you the ultimate dabs though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these, these, these take it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you had this kind of carb cap,
Oh, you just load it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, all right, here you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is just never ending.
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to just load the cap.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to load the tip of the cap and
be like, yeah, I got you dog.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that's how we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to bring it back, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and what I also forget, you forget
too, is when you need to dab someone as
[SPEAKER_14]: you cap it, you can gently hug them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just bring them in close for like the
hug, the hug ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're paralyzed at that moment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You hug them all around inside out.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a, it's a, it's a gentle,
a gentle hug of Terps for their entire
[SPEAKER_14]: body and the whole experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: Watch Lenny's is going to be a bunch of
dudes hugging each other in a fucking
[SPEAKER_14]: weird room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like this is, this is not heading in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wonders of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the spend this background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you mention the, uh, the connection
with Fidel and the food and not going
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the legendary stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We ended up, we, we grew too large for a
carousel.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause they can't cater an event of the
size that we need the way that we need it
[SPEAKER_14]: catered.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause we have to have catering service.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to, you know, find a restaurant
that could do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is just as you know, well loved and
respected.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've been then luckily there is one
in Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so we have those guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kev, what's the name of the restaurant?
[SPEAKER_14]: Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's called open sesame in Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, their food is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the spread is going to be nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, for the first night, it's going to be
nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, just to put it into
perspective, uh, we're spending about the
[SPEAKER_03]: same amount on the food this year that we
did on our entire budget last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're stepping it up in every way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the dabbers for me and everybody
that I know who really dabs, you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to have fresh fruit at everywhere,
which for me is like, I'm a happy boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I think that that's huge.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, there's a station both days the
entire time that has tea, water,
[SPEAKER_14]: fresh fruit and honey so that you can go
up and get that all the time during the
[SPEAKER_14]: entire event, which is like the Oasis,
the honey roots.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, that's the Oasis to like,
you know, you took too big of a dab,
[SPEAKER_14]: go up there, get a scoop of honey,
get some water, do a tea break.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you can go on the ground floor
for a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking get back into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, put yourself back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, it'll be, uh, it'll be,
it's cool because we also have,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, we looked at like the high times
origins of everything and how high times
[SPEAKER_14]: was and the way high times events were set
up and how everyone kind of got together
[SPEAKER_14]: and how the sponsors were involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we wanted to kind of throw back to that
in a way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do have an outdoor area that will
have the sponsorship booths with all the
[SPEAKER_14]: vendors out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's kind of a throwback to like that
high times experience that you could have.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then when you come inside,
it has the sit down, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: like the restaurant kind of feel.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we try to create that and sort of
incorporate that into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the whole entire design is all,
all Middle Eastern.
[SPEAKER_14]: So like, you know, like fucking pillows
and carpets on the floor with pillows and
[SPEAKER_14]: sitting areas and, you know, easy,
comfortable shit for, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: for taking dabs and chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's, you know, the sponsors
come through too, with a ton of stuff
[SPEAKER_14]: that'll be on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's like Apex ancillary with,
you know, there's a Q-tip stations,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's dunking stations from a banger
basket.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, uh, I mean, just a ton of
different stuff that's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, you know, Sam and those guys are
providing mystic timbers, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam and those guys are providing torches
and you know, other tools and other
[SPEAKER_14]: equipment that we have and, you know,
things we can use for, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fusion, you know, so we have a bunch of
stuff that's there that makes it work.
[SPEAKER_14]: All you really need is your rig,
your personal items.
[SPEAKER_03]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be for all the judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be nutty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those would be crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so we have a lot of products,
but we have about 25 or so other product
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could have had like,
you know, 40 people that we do this
[SPEAKER_03]: might've been a little much, but,
um, you know, these guys has stepped up
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of them are making like custom
legends of hashish stuff for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really our gift bags, our gift bags
are valued probably at the same price,
[SPEAKER_03]: if not more than like everybody's ticket
costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're throwing so much value at
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are going to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, it's because of the
product sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because of all of you here and every
other sponsor that they came in and did a
[SPEAKER_03]: one 20, you 90, you 73, you were stepped
up and, and, and came in like without all
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys, like we really couldn't throw
this kind of value at everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because I, we want it to be a great
marketing platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this is a great way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're, uh, proceeding very
well.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing too, you know,
what I always loved about legends is that
[SPEAKER_14]: there was no trophy.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no award.
[SPEAKER_14]: You, you had to like, you know,
you could tell your stories and say you
[SPEAKER_14]: won legends, but then Marcus and Sam had
to kind of confirm that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, and it's still in that same
place, you know, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's, there's, we don't want to have
like a trophy that sits in a room
[SPEAKER_14]: somewhere that's like, Oh, I won legends,
you know, second place, 20, 23,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, it just makes much more sense
to, to give the sponsors the opportunity
[SPEAKER_14]: to put products in those winners' hands,
um, that they can use every day that kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of make the experience better.
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of brings the community closer
together.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and that was kind of the idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what, what we did this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, mothership is going to be making an
award for second and third for each
[SPEAKER_14]: category for all three categories.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there will be some,
uh, some dry sift that's being entered.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause we added that, we added the dry sift
category for Sam because we thought it
[SPEAKER_14]: would be kind of a cool, a cool throwback
to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: 90% of people will enter rosin and a small
percentage of, well, I froze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus went cold room.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I froze.
[SPEAKER_09]: I stopped talking the minute I freeze,
but, um, you wouldn't know that anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I was frozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the dry sift is the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, listen, anytime you're hanging
out with hardcore puffers, they'll all
[SPEAKER_09]: have rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: A smaller percentage of them will have
full melt bubble and almost, almost none
[SPEAKER_09]: of them will have full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I'd love to see that
category grow, you know, enter your rosin
[SPEAKER_09]: and do well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe even, you know, when a,
when a placing, but then try to bring in
[SPEAKER_09]: full melt bubble next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then try to bring in full melt dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause to me that's like bringing in rosin
is the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bringing in full melt bubble is the next
hardest thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bringing in full melt dry sift is like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, uh, that's, that's, that's another
reality completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there's something to be said for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very different than, I mean,
the highest grade full melt bubble is on
[SPEAKER_09]: par with the highest grade full melt dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both, uh, spectacular.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's a lot of people that have
never tried dry sift.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they, you know, because dry sift
is, is six star.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's hard, very rare.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like, yeah, only the greatest.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only the greatest material will actually
work and turn out the way you want it to
[SPEAKER_09]: work out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like, there's this word of
God going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas with like, with oil products,
whether it's a BHO or a rosin,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're making it into rosin,
I mean, listen, we all know what great
[SPEAKER_09]: rosin is.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know what that is, but there's a lot of
people who are deceived by what they think
[SPEAKER_09]: great rosin is by just making it look,
you know, if it can, if it can kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: trick them with the way it looks,
uh, they'll be like, Oh, this must be a
[SPEAKER_09]: great rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, it's not that easy, you know,
to take, to take and make great hash and
[SPEAKER_09]: then press it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, most people are pressing their
hash into rosin because it doesn't melt
[SPEAKER_09]: and it can't be dabbed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they, you know, it's kind of like a lot
of rosin hash rosin is from mediocre hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, not saying your guys is, but I'm just
saying out in the world there,
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of people are taking hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're taking, yeah, they're taking hash
that can't be, uh, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_09]: there's the, there's the hardcore few that
are just like taking the most ridiculous
[SPEAKER_09]: quality hash and pressing that,
which, uh, I'm on the, I'm on the fence
[SPEAKER_09]: with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, well, if it was six star bubble,
I don't know if I would press it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to dab just as nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already in form in heads,
like protected.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is something to be said for the
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where everything's going down,
you know, where all of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_09]: and volatile organic compounds,
like filtering that out is, is different
[SPEAKER_09]: than not filtering it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like, uh, I like the mop up trip that,
uh, hash offers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do see oil as different myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see rosin as a, as a hash oil,
but not a hash itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, just because it's the heads have been
melted and it seems like it's,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's always going to melt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas only the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: These hat of hashes dry sifted or
whitewashed will melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a melty Darth Vader?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says on mute.
[SPEAKER_09]: JP's 27 dabs in he's thinking I'm probably
going to have to hit another dab here
[SPEAKER_09]: soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't counting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is somebody counting?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is somebody counting JP's dabs?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just joking around.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I suspect it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we all showing what we're dabbing
right now?
[SPEAKER_14]: He's at like nine, nine or 10 dabs so far.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start counting now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't counting.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll start counting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh wee little nine to you pressed into
rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that too.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Canadian, the legal Canadian market
makes it very hard to sell a 90 micron
[SPEAKER_09]: into market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's, uh, you have to see away every
grade that you keep separate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like adds a thousand dollars,
which shrinks your margin drastically,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially in Canada, in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also every micron separately.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to keep them, separate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've done it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, it can be like $8,000 just for
the COA for that batch.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want, you have to do big batches.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're also only releasing 90 micron,
well, that's another, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to have to, uh, basically
what are you going to do with the other
[SPEAKER_09]: grades?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like if, and if you put too many
skews on the market, 90, 120, like you
[SPEAKER_09]: might find the 90 sells really well,
but the other ones are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: these ones aren't selling quite as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they make it hard here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, the lot size and Ontario
used to be the worst.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause if you sell, if they ordered like
five kilos and then they sold it really
[SPEAKER_09]: fast and wanted another five kilos,
you had to have it, or you would be
[SPEAKER_09]: punished and put down lower on their
ordering order the next time they ordered
[SPEAKER_09]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so imagine like that's a whole
province.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and that's 10 kilos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine just making 10 kilos of cheese.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just 90 micron, uh, live hash rosin,
you know, like if you're making just 10
[SPEAKER_09]: kilos of that, you have quite a bit of the
other material that, and it's also because
[SPEAKER_09]: of the tax, the higher price you put on
it, the more ridiculous the tax will be on
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it ends up, uh, there's a few things
that work against us up here, but we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the best we can with what we've got.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much diversion is in the Canadian
market?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: How much diversion?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in the black market?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that all comes from statistics.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, um, they, there's this
alcohol and tobacco board.
[SPEAKER_09]: They get information from there's like,
they do their own, uh, questions,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, with people throughout the
countries, but it's all kind of like,
[SPEAKER_09]: in my opinion, the people who would know
the real numbers they're not talking to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's all really just bullshit the
whole, all of what they say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the black market is for sure alive
and well, um, less so for flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends that were just growing and
making money, they find it very hard to
[SPEAKER_09]: make money now because it's maybe
expensive or whatnot, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you can go to the store and like pick
out between like 30 or 40 flavors,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then when you buy it, have it be the
flavor that you wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sure there's shitty brands that
sell milled dried pre-rolled joints or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever that are, that are, that are
shitty, but there's also, you could
[SPEAKER_09]: navigate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you needed to, it wouldn't take you
long Addison to find some decent product
[SPEAKER_09]: where you were like, yeah, I found my
dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: These pre-rolled joints are actually
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This bag of weed is there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's products that are doing well.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the same people from the legacy
industry that have moved into the legal
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just, uh, pushing these very
large companies slowly out of market share
[SPEAKER_09]: because their whole game was to suck and
to short the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they can suck long enough and short
the entire industry long enough,
[SPEAKER_09]: they just end up being the last guy
standing and own a multi-billion dollar
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's what Canopy and Tilray
and, you know, some of these big companies
[SPEAKER_09]: are potentially doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering how much, if any,
gets diverted from the traditional market
[SPEAKER_14]: into the black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it happens for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's happening as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's so much diversion.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that just the black market like
completely repeats at a much higher level,
[SPEAKER_12]: like on the level of legal operators.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's black market facilities
that are operating, you know, on the same
[SPEAKER_12]: block and the same building, you know,
this, that, whatever, the way some of
[SPEAKER_12]: these places work down here in the U S so
I I'm not sure like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the, the licensed producers that are
necessarily putting stuff out the back
[SPEAKER_12]: door.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's like the guy who's ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have a billion grams, over a
billion grams, just sitting in vaults,
[SPEAKER_09]: like thousands and thousands and thousands
of KGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, remember Indiana Jones?
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the end of Indiana Jones?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pushing the crate through the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's Canadian wreck warehouse
mids and it is going out the back door.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to answer your question, Adam Addison,
what's interesting about like the
[SPEAKER_05]: dichotomy between Canada and the U S
markets is that in the U S it's the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the term diversion and sort of that
concept is much more clearly defined and
[SPEAKER_05]: quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in Canada, the market is still
new.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're less than five years into
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: How everybody's doing it is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mids market of the traditional
market, it's specifically like a market
[SPEAKER_05]: set in flower is just gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not because all those consumers
are now going to recreational retail
[SPEAKER_05]: stores that are licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because these consumers are off
putting these batches that they have to
[SPEAKER_05]: write off for whatever reason and
destructing them the same way it happened
[SPEAKER_05]: in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not as, it's not as easily and
openly discussed as it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: In California yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe Canadians are just more
private.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're more polite about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it'll, it'll, it'll happen
more, but you know, guys like Marcus
[SPEAKER_05]: coming in and really getting control and
getting products out guys who came up
[SPEAKER_05]: under Marcus, like, you know, Slurm and,
and Brindle and all these guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I mean, not coming up under,
but you know, in following, in his
[SPEAKER_05]: footsteps, you know, these guys are coming
to market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind selections is coming to market,
like real, real people, real smokers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we didn't have in Canada
that was always present in the U S because
[SPEAKER_05]: when the U S legalized, it wasn't federal
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you always had to have a little bit of
an appetite for risk to be involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in Canada, it was like the lights
are on.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no risk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come raise all the money and do all the
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there, there was no, uh,
the, the individual high Chad factor is a
[SPEAKER_05]: high higher Chad factor here than,
than in the U S yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: No risk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's made a shiver go up my spine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, yeah, that is pretty
interesting how, um, legalization,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, went very different,
um, between the U S and Canada and,
[SPEAKER_12]: and, you know, kind of lights on all at
once.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, fundraising all at once
right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, really did make things
different.
[SPEAKER_12]: You really did have a lot of, um,
shitty operators get there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you really did have a lot of
fraudsters go there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You really did have a lot of scumbags go
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, to raise money, just, just to
raise money because the regulatory
[SPEAKER_12]: environment is different.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, here in the U S every
state is different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, and some of these MSOs,
one of them the things that they are good
[SPEAKER_12]: at is, you know, they, they're able to
take advantage of different regulatory
[SPEAKER_12]: patterns and things in individual markets
and, and, and play things like that,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, you know, play the tax in Michigan
against California, against Oregon,
[SPEAKER_12]: against Nevada, this, that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, it's a strategy that some of
these brands rely on to survive.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, I do think that, um, you know,
the, the regular, the difference in the
[SPEAKER_12]: regulatory environment definitely changes
what the end user is able to get.
[SPEAKER_12]: The, the end user in the United States is
able to access way more different,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, products and services and things like
that than up in Canada, because there's
[SPEAKER_12]: way more people operating.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's way more licensure.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's way more guys making cash.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, I think, I think that is
definitely part of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that is definitely something
that, um, the black market does a good job
[SPEAKER_12]: of people that bring stuff in from Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's, that's how a lot of people
in the US survived for a long time was
[SPEAKER_12]: bringing shit in from Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now, um, there's a lot of high end
stuff that, that comes from here and goes
[SPEAKER_12]: back up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I think the black market,
um, kind of bridges the gap, I think,
[SPEAKER_12]: for the culture.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's why it's important to
protect the black market and respect the
[SPEAKER_12]: black market.
[SPEAKER_12]: And remember that a lot of these people
that, um, you know, have been here for 15
[SPEAKER_12]: years, 20 years, 30 years, et cetera,
um, had to do it a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and again, for us, that's why an
event like this was important to,
[SPEAKER_12]: to give back to is because a lot of these
people have been here for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it, it, it was just a lot
different back then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, we're, we've been making
controls for 15 years and the way that
[SPEAKER_12]: people grew at scale 15 years ago,
versus at scale today is way different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and, and, and just like the risk
people would assume back then and today.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to respect, um, kind of the,
the older crowd and the people that had to
[SPEAKER_12]: do it when there was way more risk,
um, is really important because at the end
[SPEAKER_12]: of the day, um, our culture is at risk
every single day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, every single day there, there's
companies coming in, there's operators
[SPEAKER_12]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's people starting up that,
that aren't about the culture,
[SPEAKER_12]: don't respect about the, don't respect the
culture, don't care about the culture.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, for us, um, that's,
that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love getting high.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis is really important to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis has done a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were able to have a business that
survived for coming on 16 years because
[SPEAKER_12]: guys are growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, it's a big deal and it does
matter.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter to me that there are
people that operate in cannabis at any
[SPEAKER_12]: level that don't even get high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, there, it does kind of bother me that
there's people that operate stores or
[SPEAKER_12]: brands or companies or this, that,
whatever, that are comfortable making
[SPEAKER_12]: money off of cannabis, but won't use
cannabis or, or, you know, look down on
[SPEAKER_12]: using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, culture is very much on the line.
[SPEAKER_12]: The more that industry progresses,
the more shit we create, the more things
[SPEAKER_12]: we monetize, the more money we rethink
about trying to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: The more we, we, we lose like our culture,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, for us, that's why
participating and being able to,
[SPEAKER_12]: to help empower you guys to do it,
how you want to do it and, and give it
[SPEAKER_12]: back to the community that you guys know
best was really important to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, we love getting high and
that's, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_12]: To us that, um, that's able to still be a
thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, you know, those, those people
that you were talking about, the,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the chads, the fuckheads,
like they, they can't sponsor legends and
[SPEAKER_14]: they won't be at legends and they,
they literally can't be in the room just
[SPEAKER_14]: based off the amount of culture and
consumption and what's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's all, you know, that's why it's
rad to have sponsors that are in line with
[SPEAKER_14]: that, that are down and understand that
that is a big part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there are people that are,
you know, mega dose consumption people
[SPEAKER_14]: that just happened to fall into the,
the hash world.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Hey, if you want to talk, you know,
you know, actual fucking milligrams,
[SPEAKER_14]: like DHO typically has more milligrams,
but I think because solvent lists is,
[SPEAKER_14]: is, you know, a little less harsh on
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can consume a lot more of it and get
even more milligrams, but you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: that's a, that's a whole other story,
but no, it's, it's legends is all about.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, what Marcus and those guys,
you know, created and let's get getting
[SPEAKER_14]: all the best people together and being
able to like celebrate in this way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and now, you know, having it on a
bigger scale, but still throwing back as
[SPEAKER_14]: much as possible to the old school stuff
is, it's kind of been, been, it's been one
[SPEAKER_14]: of the bigger challenges because you do
have to monetize it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You do have to figure it out and,
and do it correctly and then make it so
[SPEAKER_14]: that at the same time, while you're doing
that and balancing that, you have to deal
[SPEAKER_14]: with the, the politics and the culture
itself and, and, you know, how all that
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff works.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's, it's been good because,
you know, at the same time, you're so
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking busy with organizing this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, last year there was a hundred
people, so that's manageable, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can kind of juggle that,
but this year it's 250 people at max.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're just kind of expanding that
list and bringing in these other,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, figuring out the proper,
you know, list of sponsors and everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: that's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, it's still a juggle,
but at the same time, pounds of hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, supposedly, allegedly,
allegedly, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I mean, you know, a private it's
that's, what's great about that too,
[SPEAKER_14]: is that you still have the right to have a
private dinner and a private get together
[SPEAKER_14]: in an event where people come together,
all invite only, you know, there's no open
[SPEAKER_14]: sale of anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, it's, it's a nice to still have
that right to be able to do that because
[SPEAKER_14]: that's kind of, you know, you can't do it
in a restaurant because obviously it
[SPEAKER_14]: would, it would just cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: But luckily, you know, there are guys that
have some spaces and that we work with
[SPEAKER_14]: that are capable of putting it on and
helping us do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, it should be a fucking blast for
sure, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it certainly won't be the last time
we speak on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, I know that Addison has some lessons
got to head out here soon at 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have to go off with my eight year
old son today and go check him out
[SPEAKER_09]: skating.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing some skating lessons today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be a highlight for me
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I definitely want to thank everyone
that showed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely appreciate each and every one
of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll have to have you guys back on
Hashchurch another day for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're talking for a longer amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: JP, we definitely want to have you back
and just like talk about like for an hour,
[SPEAKER_09]: go into the Terp Slurper and the all of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on mute and all of the all of that
sort of information because people love
[SPEAKER_09]: that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love, love, love to come back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you all for coming out and
we'll, we'll have some more.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be talking about legends right up
until the day that it happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about three weeks away now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got 20 something days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess continue on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And smoke much hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later if it hasn't already.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll talk really soon, everybody.
