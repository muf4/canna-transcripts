[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk to you guys today
about the importance of feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know what the
endocannabinoid system is, it's a system
[SPEAKER_00]: that works within your body that actually
regulates all biological function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having your endocannabinoid system up to
snuff and in a line is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only plant on the planet that
produces cannabinoids for our
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is the amazing
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can acquire the terpenes and the
terpenoids from other plants and fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the cannabinoids are exclusive to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, feed your endocannabinoid
system daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to express to everybody that
at my age, it's very important to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep yourself nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not Wilford Brinley, but I believe
roughage is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: At my age, bun is my choice of roughage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are once more, meeting up along
this journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
I'm Wilford Brinley.
