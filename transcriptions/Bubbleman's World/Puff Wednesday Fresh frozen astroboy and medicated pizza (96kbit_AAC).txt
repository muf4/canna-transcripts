[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_06]: John B.
[SPEAKER_06]: is in the house, Mr. Burfellow,
and Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another Puff Wednesday, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gorgeous outside too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, this is pretty much one of my
favorite Puff Wednesdays yet because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: been 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been 20 years since I've grown an
actual crop, and it's been 20 years since
[SPEAKER_06]: I harvested an actual crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've never taken my own plants and
just washed them into fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as John passes me over the tools,
we are getting ready to open up the tent
[SPEAKER_06]: here and pull out the first plant for a
fresh frozen bubble bag run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you guys how stoked I am on
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got this lanky Astro Boy all fallen
over and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the size of that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a nice beefy nugget.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice smaller size.
[SPEAKER_06]: The structure of the bud alone is just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a nice looking plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to do is we're going to
take it upstairs and we're going to show
[SPEAKER_06]: you how we get it ready for the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're probably going to have a
little session while it freezes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably freeze it for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from there we're going to run this
whole plant through the bubble now and
[SPEAKER_06]: through the 8-bag original bubble bag kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does smell so good, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well let's catch up with you
guys back upstairs out on the deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
All
[SPEAKER_06]: right guys, we are back up on the deck.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a scorching day, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: John's just feeding his endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fell off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually looked at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I can't believe how excited I am to
cut this thing down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So today we thought we would film the
process of us just preparing the plant for
[SPEAKER_06]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the container that, geez,
I mean, I've seen this container a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was full of My Little Pony that
time we went to Whistler, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got filled with Medi Kush and
Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's going to be Astro Boyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was your fresh frozen birthday lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was Astro Boy before?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was My Little Pony, it was Astro Boy,
Medi Kush, and now Astro Boy again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this Tupperware has seen some good
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know what we get out of one of these
Tupperware containers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have the scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought my scale with a little bucket
that I have tarred.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can put about 300 grams in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll let you know what the wet
vegetative yield is on this once we've cut
[SPEAKER_06]: it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to just start trimming some
nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut the first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hold this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you haven't done this in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that big top sucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited, actually, to get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a nice little fatty right there,
I tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just get to actually keep my fans
separate.
[SPEAKER_06]: This I will actually trim down to about
four buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing's just hitting the ground
plump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four and five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's a nice little fat nugget right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to join me and cut some of
these down?
[SPEAKER_06]: That last one was a little bit heavier.
[SPEAKER_06]: That definitely added some weight to our
little bin.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: My god, is the flavor nice on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to be doing this with you,
John.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're really quite integral in getting me
back into growing, getting me back into
[SPEAKER_06]: having the ability, the access,
the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I did was open a door for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it was a very... A door that
you've already known so well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still muchly appreciated you opening it,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can open that door, too, and you
should learn to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're doing here, and the best thing
about this is this is exactly what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to do to produce real medicine,
is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the cleanest and the freshest and
probably, I would say, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacious way of consuming your
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is the equivalent of ordering
the pizza and opening the box and eating
[SPEAKER_06]: the pizza, not the box with the pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really just... People are sitting
there watching, and they're maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking, is this really worth it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that really worth it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is it worth it to extract the
medicine, the thing that you love about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, the reason that you're growing
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it worth it to extract it so you can
acquire it in an unadulterated fashion?
[SPEAKER_06]: I absolutely think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, this thing has a lot of growth on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this structure and how it is,
and as this is gradually filling up,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say you're going to get
roughly about 350 to 400 grams of frozen
[SPEAKER_02]: wet out of this, which in return is going
to be what I equaled out to what I owe
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always do.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 12 grams or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 to 12 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be surreal if I even got close to
that just from the one little plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but... And actually, this was the little
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that great big one in the other
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much nicer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can really just feel that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely touching these nuggets and just
getting some nice clear... Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure is some nice nuggets.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time I've grown it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sure feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, you're chopping down your own
fresh, and the best part about it is
[SPEAKER_02]: you're about ready to run it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to give thanks to TGA, Bad Boy,
Subcool, Jill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys, for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let the haters get you down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see them hating on you guys,
and you guys are inspirational.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get on doing a little bit more
of what you guys are doing with the way
[SPEAKER_06]: you care for your patients and your
customers and the way you promote and get
[SPEAKER_06]: all these toy runs and food drives and
raising money for the young guy with the
[SPEAKER_06]: tumor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to see that they give so much
back to the community, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's inspirational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even...
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we all like to do.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody feels good when you help
somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's where it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increases that dopamine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can't get it until you give
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, super, super stoked on this,
John.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these nuggets are so dense and so
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely, barely touching them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're going right into the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is the easiest way of
trimming, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like me, you'll see with my last video
there, all I did is I cut down my plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm only growing them about this
tall and put it directly into the freezer,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you got one downstairs at the Bubba
Cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'll probably do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole plant fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got to run that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to do that probably tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to get my good old Mike and
Hetty over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's learning how to feed his
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, some of these fans are just coated so
lovely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still going to separate them, do a fan
leaf run and a bud run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can only improve your quality when you do
such things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get off the biggest fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just prepare your herb for extraction,
for isolation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done this in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I did it, I never did it like
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never froze it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and I certainly didn't know about
washing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done so much, but you've never
washed your own weed that you've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a high five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's happening today with you,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get all these fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to weigh some of this
out just to give everyone a little idea of
[SPEAKER_06]: what we got going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll tear this bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's turn it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Start filling this bucket up.
[SPEAKER_06]: 230, 200,
[SPEAKER_06]: 250.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so 243 fresh right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: 243, nice, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like we got just a little bit more
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, just a beautiful sunny day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunny day here going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Planes flying by, boats going by.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the place to be on the water right
behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we're going to be doing a run
pretty soon doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we'll get out on the water this year
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to a couple of boat runs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do some fresh frozen on the hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll do a proper this time where
everything's working.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get some power.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get some power.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get some power.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it's amazing how many of these little
popcorns just exist once you think they're
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of already done and side with.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, no, there's still quite a
few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Popcorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I'm doing, I've been saving all
of my stock over the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to make some hemp concrete
out of my stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to mortar and put a
bit of a barbecue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bricks from my tearing down my one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make something that I've
grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was just a brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be doing it for years just saving
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this stock is going to get run once I
get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do all the stock and fan leaf
in one separate bubble run.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the fan, all the stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to run it just to show people,
you know, what's possible when your resin
[SPEAKER_06]: is coating all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fresh buds here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to pop the lid on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it down to the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the last of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it down to the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess what we're going to do is sit
and have a serious session.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll let this get frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we come back, we're going to run
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to run my first crop and plant
in over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're back down in the garage and this
is going in the fridge freezer freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm messing around with the fridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: John's got a nice little space made and
doesn't want to get off my fingers because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: John and I are going to go puff now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, awesome puff montage, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some nice ripping all over the
place, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick, you know, three,
four rips a piece and boom, bam,
[SPEAKER_06]: boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back in the house and we're still
giving that fresh frozen some time to
[SPEAKER_06]: become full, fresh, frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not quite frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided we would make medicated
pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Homestuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to mega ill and Mark Cokie for
turning us on to a great concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit I had never even thought
of medicated pizza before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have our ingredients here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've nothing, nothing too crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some, a couple of different
types of sauces, just purchased sauces,
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing homemade.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some crushed garlic,
some pineapples, red pepper, you got some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the veggie ground beef there and some
almonds, mozzarella cheese, tomato,
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp hearts, and a little bit of balsamic
vinegar to top off the fresh leaves that
[SPEAKER_06]: we just removed from the Astro Boy that
we're about to run.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of these are coated in resin,
but just in case there's not enough,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got about a half a gram of some
Astro Boy dry sift to throw on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a real Astro Boy medicated
pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we get to run the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to make the Astro Boy
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how sweet is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to grab the top one here,
John, that will be you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take the bottom and we're going to
make some medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go right into the sauce with
my sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to get right in here
and get this cheese going because I like a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of cheese on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what other people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing about the cheese,
it helps absorb the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is for certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you definitely need that melted cheese
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super simple to medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can soak your sift in an olive oil
and, you know, lightly rub the crust with
[SPEAKER_06]: the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I have at home, which I do quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you do the medicated that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's grab a little bit of this sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put that right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw a little garlic in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love a lot of garlic on the pizza,
I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a little bit of the sifty in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just melts away into the sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a little bit of pineapple on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a bit of a freak.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the pineapple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I borrow the knife?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get right in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get some sift on your pizza pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm getting a little extra in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could destroy you, but it won't hurt
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be very well medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of got an idea how much I use
throughout my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is actually, I found this in
your fridge and I kind of liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically veggie ground round,
but it's the Mexican style.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me it was like having a taco pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had the tomato there and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to just put in little bits of
the tomato throughout.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely am hands on with pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of cheese, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go over complex on my toppings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably put a little bit more sift
on top of cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got some on the bottom and some on
the top.
All right,
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit more sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much of a pineapple guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, pineapple and veggie meat might be a
bit strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, some leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take this big daddy big leaf
right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get into some, of course,
hemp seed hearts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just our medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing about the hemp seed hearts,
it helps digest a lot better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm definitely going to be doing
hemp seed hearts right on top of these
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, salivating at the thought of eating
this pizza in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great way to spend an afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little basic, just a little bit of
pitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, like I said, I use medicated
oil and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add a touch of some extra oil on top.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little drizzle of balsamic vinegar on
mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just over the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just give that a little
splash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw that little knife on there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more cheese just to fill up
the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now we're going after the cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just looked at you had two thirds
of it on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured, wow, see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two thirds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, we are about to put the
medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here she goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best part about this is really is
you can really feed your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to be saying this
quite a bit because of Dr. David Allen
[SPEAKER_02]: talking more about how eating more
cannabinoids with the hemp seed hearts and
[SPEAKER_02]: with the oils and even the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ways you can
actually ingest cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do it all through history.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consume them with a consensual amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's just great ways of being able
to.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant gives us everything we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost incredible to really think
that it can clothe and house and feed and
[SPEAKER_06]: protect everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your pizza looks great, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm quite excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the color that you got with the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a nice big green one in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you have the whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Fibonacci.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that one off would be on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fibonacci.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to eat these pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll show them coming out of the toaster
just to show them the finished product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine will be ready in about nine minutes
and John's will go in right after that and
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll show you what they look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people want to see the people in the
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a spill of fresh leaf on here
too?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the way we like to medicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much agreed, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say this is a nice way to take a
break in the middle of the day after some
[SPEAKER_06]: hard ripping and yeah, eat a medicated
pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nuggets and leaves on our pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cut the pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great little pizza knife.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get it cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will do the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor of that leaf that I just cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Astro boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first bite was the Astro Boy nugget.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say this will not be the last time
I do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bon Appetit, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bon Appetit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's my nugget right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs up pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was a pretty good pizza scarf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a scarf that one down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some good effects pretty soon after
finishing it, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice vibe on the medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of sift, a little bit of
freshly pulled sugar fan leave,
[SPEAKER_06]: and a few little nuggets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the job.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess next up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're working on is,
well, we know how much we've weighed out
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, about 260, 270 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of fresh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's probably, you know, a quarter to a
fifth of that weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than a hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably 60 grams of dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 60 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what we get from that on some
nice full milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to veg for a little bit here
and then we'll fresh frozen down with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: For Johnny.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_06]: John and I got pretty high on that pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We melted out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we had, we, we of course wrote 420 and
here we are, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, here we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to finally run this batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been kind of wasting, uh,
it takes a lot to get ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we lined, um, here's one cool
thing we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lined pizza boxes with parchment paper
and on each box we marked them 190 and
[SPEAKER_06]: 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: 73 and of course 45 and 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought that was pretty, uh,
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, inside is lined with the
parchment paper unbleached.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be able to easily put our resins
on there with lots of room for it to sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of allow the cardboard to close over it,
be protected, no dust, no debris.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So today we're going to use the bubble
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got actually a bunch of new bubble
now prototype washing machine bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a 20 gallon one and you could
actually use two of these in the 20 gallon
[SPEAKER_06]: machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just sort of one of, uh,
my man, uh, my manufacturer's old designs.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sort of revamped it and he's actually
thrown his label on there for the first
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you start seeing Acme label,
you'll know that that's been my
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer for the past 12 or so years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, he, uh, helps, helps make,
uh, makes, make the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit better for you guys out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's another flatter design,
a nice big open zipper in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just stuff that full.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also for a larger washing machine,
kind of a cool design, not something we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to play with today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, although he does have a smaller one
right here that could potentially fit in
[SPEAKER_06]: here, a little bit big compared to,
uh, the barrel shape bag, which fits just
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people are using different
machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are using larger washing
machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to start offering the
marketplace, um, some alternatives to the
[SPEAKER_06]: standard same old, same old bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, today I think I'm going to go with my
old standby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've got quite a few runs to do,
so I'll get to the prototype bag,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, probably on the second or third
planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now we're going to use the barrel
shaped bag and we're going to pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: do it just like we did with yours,
John.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to stack ice herb,
ice herb, ice herb right to the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking a bubble bag originals.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the three tiers, um,
bubble bag lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: These ones, uh, are the, the, the,
the money saver, 150 bucks for a eight
[SPEAKER_06]: bag, five gallon kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: John's holding the bubble bag standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: These ones are an eight bag kit as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get all the colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's about $275 for an eight bag kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the, the, the originals,
which is, you know, the best of the best,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, those retail for three 40 for the
eight bag kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think we're going to use the OGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put those originals for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I'll let you hold that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get some fresh frozen ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to grab a little bit of your
neighbor's ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grabbed a half pound bag out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So put a little bit nice layer on the
bottom there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is for Rosie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she's nice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna hold it up actually a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another batch of ice on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a little bit more herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do this all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, look at that big nugget.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the top guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticky on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peel off that layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great big half moon ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love our half moon ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say half moon ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, mind reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one whole plant, which is the
best thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much resin can we get off of one
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did wear before going in and uh,
we're going to be smoking her after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at champs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll definitely, uh, we definitely will
be doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll put that last little bit of ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also have the last bit of this
store bought ice can go on top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit to top it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for your first fresh frozen run,
he honors sir, zipping up your bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is kind of like history.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making your own Rome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.
73.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got our nice chilled water,
five gallons of it sitting also packed
[SPEAKER_06]: chock full of ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a definitely four degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That ice is not going to be melting away
on us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess, uh, pouring a little bit of
this in first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just sitting back watching this whole
thing happen.
What do
[SPEAKER_05]: we got there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a tiny ton of ice inside the machine,
but a decent amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hit that perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you've done that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Top it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the tiniest bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it up another inch or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Close that up and let's go for a little
mix in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say four and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Catch you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So while that's over there, mixing it up,
we thought we would show you guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though I'm sure you guys have seen
this a lot, but for those of you that
[SPEAKER_06]: haven't, why all the bags, what order did
they go in?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're going to go through
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people always want to use the 190
and go right to the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason for this people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go in an order.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this it's a sieve stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two 20 is the largest bag,
the blue bag, and it goes down through two
[SPEAKER_06]: 20, one 90, one 60, one 20, 90,
73, 45 and 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first bag you put in in a stack like
that, of course, is going to be the bottom
[SPEAKER_06]: one, the 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a purple bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get that guy in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a nicely into the bubble bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Help me wrap that around there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can actually lift that one up even a
tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, the 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our secondary bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second bag complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next comes my favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: John's favorite is the gold 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wearing the 73 today on my shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find the bag that you like the
most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have the 45, some people like
the 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a 90 fan, 90 and 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of happen to like them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got everyone, but I mean,
the one that always runs out for me is
[SPEAKER_02]: always the 90, 70, then the 120,
the 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the order that lets you know really
what is the best and what you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're at the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my favorite almost exclusively.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a good bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get some fire in the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, crack that open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting a little bit tighter on our,
with all the bags we put in now,
[SPEAKER_06]: we put in four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good to keep the starting it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: These 90, 120, 73, 90, the 120,
the following, you don't take out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't take out, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have, you know, cause I do work at
a local hydroponic store and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we just use the 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously you're talking about leaving the
bag out of even using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never take any bags out.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I'll just to reiterate,
always use all the bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to help you understand more of
what's going on each time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may surprise you sometime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you, if you cut yourself off from
that and you just use a few of those bags,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't get the outfit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they ever have anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're excited like, well,
uh, yeah, I just, I got the three bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to hit this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three bag system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean three bag system was something in
1999, 2000.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll rush over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we, uh, finished with our last three
bags, how about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got our one, 60 left.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just put our one 20, the orange bag in
after the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our one 60.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is red.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get that in there and then
we'll literally walk this bucket over
[SPEAKER_06]: there and we will filter some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might even do a second run almost
immediately with that material just to see
[SPEAKER_06]: how efficient we've been.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a nice idea to check.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people like to run and run and run
and run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do two runs and then I'm
going to soak my material, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: in a coconut oil and do a little
extraction like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I haven't done that I'm
going to do next time myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always talking about the Rick Simpson oil
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Coconut oil guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, not just using your shitty,
uh, you know, I'm not going to only use
[SPEAKER_06]: the leftover bubble material.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use some of my good dry sift
and some of my good bubble to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: produce some nice, uh, coconut infused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should pull this one down a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tight, but we can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it all tastes as a friend to
give you a hand here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's also how well you like on this
side, I pulled mine down very well because
[SPEAKER_06]: you see how it goes down below the bags on
this side, the way he's, the way the bags
[SPEAKER_06]: are added in this little metal piece is
catching up on his side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could have easily removed this,
this little metal piece, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: we kind of spaced it, but that's the
reason the bags are catching up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause John had the whole metal piece on
his side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one more bag and we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to keep that one up as high as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and take your side first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This bag's a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice and open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just leave that like that almost like a
little bit off the tip of the lip and it
[SPEAKER_06]: lifts the screen up for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are using a 220 bag in the machine over
there, but it's never a bad idea to double
[SPEAKER_06]: up on bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you had extra bags in your kit,
like an extra 160 or an extra 120,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could throw them in there and you'd be
surprised at what you, uh, might find
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself keeping from the next screen,
even though it's the same size screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall we run over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to follow me over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to follow you over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking right on over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at those plants just doing so well up
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that smells so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to use this little guy as
our table.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can get everything lifted up so you
guys can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it up there.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all organized.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I guess we'll have to first have
it a little bit lower just for the drain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, nice Kool-Aid colored water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's run it through some Kool-Aid
colored water right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very light, light, light pinkish color.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a very short run.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was four minutes, four and a half
minutes maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll probably fill this back up with
water, plug it in over the, over yonder
[SPEAKER_06]: towards the end of our, um, batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll turn it on again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll let it sit without water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll fill another bucket up to cool it
with ice water and then I'll do one second
[SPEAKER_06]: run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we pull this, we'll just do another
quick run and see if, uh, if there's any
[SPEAKER_06]: metals there at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had my spoon because you know,
I would be drinking that right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pull the hash out of it and
then you can drink as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to drink the hash though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can drink it once we pull the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will still smell awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will still smell great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not sitting in any water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get rid of this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get this guy up here right in
between us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is this where we're going to do our
cleaning right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where our cleaning is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to switch sides because I'm
going to be cleaning over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what I'll do real quick is I'll
move a few of these things out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly cannabis plants, telephones and
such.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll make a little bit of room for
cleaning right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, basically, you know, microplaning,
I should say, not cleaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting ready here, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your microplaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect spot for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sieving now and reason why is
because we saw the microplaning and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think we were damaging those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never was in the microplaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never got into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not against those who are into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't claim that they're destroying
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're degrading anything
worse than I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't, I don't like the way it
looks into the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way it makes me feel when
I go into that world and I see those heads
[SPEAKER_06]: just maceated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will always use the sieve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like the sieve.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the sieve.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little bit of, uh, 220 there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to squash it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know what we're going to require.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we set up the pressing screens inside
its own box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I got a paper towel laid down to
absorb moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got our, um, our spoon and we're
sort of ready to start collecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little spray ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, start collecting bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know what would really be nice?
[SPEAKER_06]: The small bucket that we use last time to
flip all the bags inside out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the last thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up getting that bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super important to have this just to be
able to flip the bags over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always liked the bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's just a nice little option.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a little bit smaller than the
actual size of the screen, but a little
[SPEAKER_06]: spray, mostly contaminant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I tell you how much I love this spray
bottle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good little bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a little bit of 220, not too much to
see there on the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet something, but always yet something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically nothing, but something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just shows that the work bag that was
initially in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to take that with the bucket
for cleaning?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as John's doing that, I will lift the
next bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very little there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is even less John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very little 160, which makes a lot of
sense when you're running fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not using a lot of dry material.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's trichome heads are breaking off and
almost nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not going to see too much on
the 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to just get the goods.
[SPEAKER_06]: 160 and 190 bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost nil.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a tiny little bit of contamination on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The slightest little amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely able to scoop it out with a spoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barely able to scoop it, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even getting them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a little bit of 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: First actual grade to see collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I did my one with 45 was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a nice 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see, we're going to see
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's got a little bit of blonde
esque hash on the screen as one might
[SPEAKER_06]: expect from the 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very small amounts as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a rip amongst that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one a clean because that was an
actually nice grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: First frozen bottles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit more this time around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some creamy goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a huge amount, but nice, nice little
puddle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure looks incredible for color was almost
yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiny little amounts, but wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean our spoon and our bag inside the
other bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get that resin off of there
and not all melted into your screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it needs quite a bit of forced
water on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have quite a bit of fresh frozen to
still run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got like four or five more plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: John has, oh geez.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least two or three full batches as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two full bins ready to go for John.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do this first run just
to see how effective we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really didn't break the nuggets up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to get what I would call
the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to do it in my,
in my different, uh, all screen bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what's over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to give it that last little
rinse inside the bag before you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cold water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not very sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet, but I suspect once the water
evaporates off my hands, it can get a
[SPEAKER_06]: little stickier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that water really is rose color.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see it in the white bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a little bucket from you.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little puddle of 45 next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give that one a
little spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: Able to spray out a couple of tiny little
chunks of contaminants in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blow them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puddle of 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little chunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember we did a very, very light mix and
we did a very little breaking up of the
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to make any assumptions based on
a couple of runs, but yeah, like after,
[SPEAKER_06]: after running it for like a year or two or
three or four, I might start next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll know so much more and plus you'll
have like covered it, bred it with this,
[SPEAKER_06]: bred it with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to run that again because I
know there's more material in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it with my macro lens.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: That last little bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they looked a lot like most of the
trichomes I photograph, but I guess
[SPEAKER_06]: that's, uh, could be deceiving too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, whoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the eight bag system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the egg bag system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it in your hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the last one right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little drying bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little drying bubble bag scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got this 25 micron last,
but certainly not least.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a new drying system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can have a drink of your water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, someone just wanted to drink my
bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, uh, I guess we'll get to moving some
of this water out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like this one's already done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it dried on my back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pushed up against my back and then let
out all the water, but I don't mind
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a little wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when I'm making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we've got ourselves a nice little
miniature yields, much smaller than I was
[SPEAKER_06]: expecting actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, this still could be two to
three grams and we might've only run a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of ounces dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's probably still another three to
four grams on that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say those big bonds that weren't
broken down yet to breaking all those buds
[SPEAKER_02]: apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just kind of throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just do perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best that we can get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're going to do that while I let
this, this still absorb itself from the
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's not ready yet to be sifted to
be seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we'll leave this for about maybe three
to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that, and I'm going to go prepare the
machine for a second run.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will be nice and open and he'll be
able to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to get it done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want everyone to be able to see what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so the zipper doesn't open.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then does that thing work?
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not want this thing opening up the
mid run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Break these off.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stripping from this stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're definitely, um, I can already
see, we could just see all the track holes
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about, excuse me, if I could just go
in here for a second, I'll grab another
[SPEAKER_06]: big bag of those sorts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be more big ones in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these are, there's a big one if you
want a big new shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see these are all just full of
frozen ice and the level is kind of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: when you break them apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They split and have ice all throughout
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way through the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they break so perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually never done this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the middle of the buns,
there's like, just like ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I need these scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: More huge nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice frozen nuggets.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely nice and easy to break
them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a bit are, are smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really just those few large pieces
that we needed to break up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finish it up there and I will get the next
batch of bags ready.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like those big bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the center is like these little,
yeah, just, it's, it's really cool to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually see this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never looked at it this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the way I can just access the bags
through the spin wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can get yourself a spin wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just happen to be, just happen to be
hanging around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a stand up comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is definitely getting more
broke up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All nicely broke up now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just pack another bag of ice into
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more bag of ice that I'll pack
in there and we'll do a nice quick second
[SPEAKER_06]: run.
[SPEAKER_06]: See if we can't up the ante on our,
our yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I'm personally too worried.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever I get is the medicine I get.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be soaking this plant
matter in coconut oil afterwards,
[SPEAKER_06]: doing the two batches through the bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still have more plants left.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just new ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of people really can tell you
how much resin they get off of a plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that they grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you pulled the last one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was leaving that one for ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this giant one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although that's a pretty big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you pull that one out though?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just dug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just said it wasn't my first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how many rodeos I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured you've been to a few though.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got this plant matter all wet and
goopy, breaking these buds down a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit by finger.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: I suggest doing it when they're cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: All nice and ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not sticking to my fingers
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you actually want to grab the bag of
ice just behind you, get rid of this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get him in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuffed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuffed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more the merrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colder, the more heads fall off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you want to ensure your cold
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, obviously it's going to get to
a certain temperature and then it's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to plateau.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you can get it to four degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, four is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four point two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brittle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four point two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will use our chilled,
terpene rich water that we filtered
[SPEAKER_06]: through a 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any sort of little bits of that that we've
been through the last.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're filled right up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a perfect pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just turning it around now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right to the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of overboard on the rose
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might take a sip of that one now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do our sieving.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to catch up with you in a bit
when we pull the next batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're dabbing while we bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing while we bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot we were on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just mixing up more of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So second run, you know, we left that out
for the tiniest little bit there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, it looks pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just leave it out and then I'll,
I thought it was a pretty good judge of
[SPEAKER_06]: deceive.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit is the gummiest, gooiest,
most ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just completely stuck to the pressing
screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go put it.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the freezer and we're going to have to
see that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just the way that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I guess we're at the point where
we're going to do another drain.
[SPEAKER_06]: The water color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Rose?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's a mocha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of mocha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mocha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks creamy and it looks like a
mocha cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, actually, why don't you get in here
and then I'll put that there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can stand right there and we'll drop
this in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a mocha cream pie coming in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There she is purple at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is mocha mocha.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm colorblind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely not the same color that it
was when we started with the first batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's creamy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure stinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting is going to be the
best part about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is actually like what I've done on my
second run to my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not received it, dried it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it all sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one day I might have it tested and
worse looking at it, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can photograph it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I kind of plan on doing with
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just photographing it after I ran it and
seeing what we've got going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always do this with the machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always just a tiny little bit of
water that will fit in the spinner disc at
[SPEAKER_06]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lean it over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it all out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of just getting this out
of the way right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how you like to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Best assistant on the whole planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dylan always is more helpful than helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we will start again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're a little more of a longer mix
that time and we did break the buds up
[SPEAKER_06]: more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't surprise me that there's a
little bit more contaminant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like you want to be all excited seeing
this bag full, but awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The puddle of the 220.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all photographic.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will definitely spray the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is definitely at least the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't often do it with the next one
either, but it has happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a river.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on a river.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I even mean like on purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the contaminant got caught up in
the 220.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a little bit here in the
190.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just enough to make it noticeable when I
put all of the grades together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few little chunks, pretty much the
same color as the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it green?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit green.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I, when I think of the coconut oil,
this is all just perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's medicine in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to make all the grades of the
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to just do it with my worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take some of my nineties,
some of my seventies, some of my 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of experiment with the different
grades.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Piles are much more substantial than last
time, but still quite small.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it could have been,
you know, only, well, it could have been
[SPEAKER_06]: as little as 40 grams that I ran.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do, if it's sometimes it's a
quarter, sometimes it's one fifth the
[SPEAKER_06]: amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely did give those a lot of
water the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be something to experiment with,
John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cutting down on the water about five days,
four days before you cut your fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_06]: down, stress it out, produce more resin
and potentially get a lot less water
[SPEAKER_06]: weight in the fresh plant matter because
it doesn't have it.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: 120 bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one we're going to have to be
careful with.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one we're going to want to be
very careful with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't managed to strain any of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble yet because it is just so it's also
a very nice day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're actually working in a pretty warm
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might end up sieving it all,
but we'll see what happens once I pull the
[SPEAKER_06]: 120 out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely got a lot more of that
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say at least three times as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be even four or five times as
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely the second run is giving us
a lot better yields after breaking up
[SPEAKER_02]: those bugs because they were just those
big solid nugs that we showed you that we
[SPEAKER_02]: just threw in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tossed them right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanted to get the maximum and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that first, would you like to
feed that in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can dump that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it is the 120 and the 120 is so
nice, we're just going to give it a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: little rinse just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up is the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually has a little bit of hold this
time around.
[SPEAKER_06]: After a little bit longer of a mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon me, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's got a hold, that means that's a
good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see something there in the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a little bit on the side of the bag
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect chance to use the mister.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't catch it back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has a real nice color to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to look surreal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be snot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, I'm so much more enjoying the
second run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, it's always a good idea to do a
couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here showing you what... You know
what?
[SPEAKER_06]: How else do you know how efficient you
are?
[SPEAKER_06]: You just assume?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of us just do it soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is why we have to first don't
succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then roll again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the first one was a success.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be like the first sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is some of the way to just
cure it up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like first bounce with dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, truly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I'm... First bounce
with fresh-frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exciting making some fresh-frozen
with my buddy John.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of contamination has found
its way in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy to get the finger in there and pull
it out when it's that small.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a single piece, but it could be
another.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think I see another.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I see another.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is never a bad idea to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't... You know, if you can see it,
and you can access it, just get it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't think, oh, I'll wait till later when
it's out on the parchment or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know there's only three bags
left, and I'm running out of folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a good way to know, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's almost a bluish tinge.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of contaminant,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always nice to be able to use the spray
bottle for just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pull it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pull it out with my fingers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty big piece of whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can blow it right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can get a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, definitely seeing better yields all in
a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a stigma hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a bug in the last bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't a bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a stigma hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stigma?
[SPEAKER_06]: Stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Acapitate, or a pistolet, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stigma hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is our 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly did up our yield by many,
many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm anticipating this 45 is going to be
like two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know it's not going to fit on the
pressing screen, I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as looking here now, we're definitely
seeing twice as much as our last one,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we're gaining upwards of... It's twice
as much right now before I pull this bag,
[SPEAKER_06]: which will probably make it three times as
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the great thing with water
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you feel the need to just keep running
your material, you'll know when the
[SPEAKER_06]: quality is down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you just want to keep
getting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're pulling quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, but it is a great way to get this
stuff into your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just eat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good old big 45 that we wear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird that the bag's out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
Release.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being a bit weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holding the goods here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice 45.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a little bit of contaminant there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm seeing...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the 45 is just... The watermelon is
loving the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be that sativa in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that looks creamy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we better give them a little sight
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's about three grams there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice yield for...
[SPEAKER_02]: Small, fresh, frozen batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at maybe getting another
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we will, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can put that right into a colander
right now and just hash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's a nice little pile,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a real nice pile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a decent yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the kind of yield you get off of
when you run like a couple hundred grams
[SPEAKER_06]: of dry material.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a nice big fat 45 like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's surprising to get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe you did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we going to eat it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking about... Man, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to treat this guy better.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next time I have a spoonful of resin,
he's eating it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's eating it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to feed this guy's endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's working overtime all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I much appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holding its water steady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lifting the water with the resin allows
the water to push down and fit through the
[SPEAKER_06]: screen without being blocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much quicker way of...
[SPEAKER_06]: draining the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to wait for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to help it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best part about this is we cut
down that plant at around lunchtime and
[SPEAKER_02]: here we are getting close to dinner and I
think we might even do a hit off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can't crop your weed and dry and
get it all running one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the 25.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at how mess and white it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to squeeze that over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 25, I find, is the one you really
don't need the spray bottle for.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like silk.
[SPEAKER_06]: The spoon moves it around perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silkiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The silky 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silky 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we definitely have pulled,
by looking up there, there's the spoon for
[SPEAKER_02]: John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: This here alone should be a drink in your
local store somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Kool-Aid that you've never
tried before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble, bubble aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this would probably go for like
$50 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it here for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is snot done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sealed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's show them what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll take the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to show you guys what that
looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's our 220, 190, 160, 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: 90, 73, 45, 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess freeze them up and get the
sieve out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the microplane, I should say.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be microplaning this batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to spin that around a few times?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we dry our bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it tightening?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to add finally that we've cleaned
the machine out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bubble now machine is all cleaned out
and rinsed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The all screened bubble now bag is nice
and clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've separated the ice from the plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was the 250 fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll dry it out and I'll let you guys know
what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: In regards to dry weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll also microplane.
[SPEAKER_06]: The resin was just too sticky to be able
to sieve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with the warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much snot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty snotty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure if I'm going to do it
tonight or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll make sure I set up the camera
when I do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just going to be simply microplaning it
onto each cardboard pizza box on top of
[SPEAKER_06]: the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll stack them and probably
photograph it with the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do some melt videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this video will be complete.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming back for the melt video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make a point on not smoking this
hash until I smoke it with you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say I'm going to sleep downstairs and
put the cot in just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I'm a very shady kind of
character.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got our water that we used.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our terpene rich water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can do what you want with
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people claim they pray that they're
feeding the plants with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think today that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give my plants a little bit of this bubble
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is quite cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to let it warm up a little
bit before I give it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably I'll give it to them tomorrow in
the morning.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So loving this bubble bag wheel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you guys at the next step.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, happy hash making.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a long day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicated pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Major bowls beforehand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Major bowls during and after.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do major bowls now,
I suspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess we'll see whether or not we're
going to do that microplanning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm kind of interested in seeing
what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because after actually doing the first and
the second run, I'd say our yields are
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to jump out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just by looking at what's seen there
and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we push it probably, you know,
anywhere from seven to ten.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say we got probably around seven
grams, which is not too bad when you think
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I only had six of them in the tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tent could have easily fit ten of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say at least eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: One plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we actually don't even know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So see, you did seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're guesstimating.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a neat idea of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're focused on how much resin that we
got and the profile of that resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried about the yields,
but I love the idea of sharing with you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys how much a plant yielded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in vegetative weight first,
but resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll let you know the veg
numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make you go through and do the math.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll start understanding the value
of the plant is in the resin, not in the
[SPEAKER_06]: diluted plant matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Microplanning up next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, just to show you one last thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got all the ice put away and frozen in
the freezer so I can use that ice again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took all the plant matter out of the
plastic bag and I've actually got it
[SPEAKER_06]: inside this pizza box right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the bud that I ran the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to dry it out and I'll weigh it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got a coconut extraction
that I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll show you guys that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty stoked on all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you what's up on the microplane
next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, welcome to Balla Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: The final stage here after whipping off a
fresh batch of fresh frozen Astro Boy with
[SPEAKER_06]: John yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did leave the hash in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seemingly, some of it won't even
freeze.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pull it off the pressing screen and it's
just the goopiest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited to get this hash broken up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got small amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe four or five grams once all said and
done.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've got our boxes here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that each box is marked with a
micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each box is lined with parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll keep all the parchment folks out
there happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the anti-card boarders.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can still use my cardboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got some ice packs here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are cryo pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't leak.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't produce moisture on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got another one here that
it's sitting on as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's a paramedic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one gets hot and cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's nice to have the hash
pushed between the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we're going to start with the
220.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, let's get our gloves on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always nice to protect the hands from the
resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be careful when you're wearing
gloves in your microplaning that you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: get too close to the planer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And plane off any of the plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our 220.
[SPEAKER_06]: Breaking up quite nice because it really
is just mostly contaminant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a little bit of resin
in there, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really too, too worried about how that
works out.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a couple of little chunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the 220, not too worried.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 220, 190, 160, 120, 90, 73,
45, 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can throw these into here as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: These little guys here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the 190.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very small piles on these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost nothing there at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's what we got, so we're going to
run it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just add that I did freeze the
microplane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does help to have this thing as cold as
possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got our 190, 160.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to go next up to 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cracking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear it peeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost immediately, I feel it stick to my
fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some nice hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loses its cold really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, can you smell the goodness?
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoo, I tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while since I actually made
some fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just all going to stay here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so used to making it for my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never a bad idea to give the microplane a
whack to give it a clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice small amount of 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you've got to see how easy it is to
have the bubble in the pizza box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Line it with parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Close it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The desiccant of cardboard will work
without even touching.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just having that moisture getting pulled
out from the whole full covered cardboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one's the 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one we're going to stand up for,
get a little more serious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting to stick right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes when the resin starts to
stick, especially with this particular
[SPEAKER_06]: microplane, you can just gently bring it
over the microplane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually, when you think all
is lost and all is hopeless, you can still
[SPEAKER_06]: get that resin broken up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a little bit on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did lose a little bit of its... I'll be
able to freeze that and pull that resin
[SPEAKER_06]: off, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a nice light microplane.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is just called microplane.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bumps are very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't rip the plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't shred my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do want to pay attention depending on
what kind of microplane you do have
[SPEAKER_06]: because some of them will shred your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's our 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to do a quick refreeze of
the material because I find that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back to microplane the 73,
the 45 and the 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll get it all put away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll add some photographs of the final
material and hopefully we'll do some melt
[SPEAKER_06]: videos and we'll just keep on processing
the plants out of my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two more Astro Boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Bubba Kem and I have a Medi Kush
as well as the My Little Pony,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's still quite a ways from being
done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will get back to you soon here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I refroze the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to happen often when you're
doing microplaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got number 73 next up to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great sound of that coming off quite
proper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're nice thin patties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're...
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got me about...
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was microplaning for about four
seconds before the hash decided to turn
[SPEAKER_06]: into a nightmare to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you can get it broken into
smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do prefer my sieve, but I made a
mistake with this hash in the sense that I
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed it to sit for a little bit too
long and it just gummed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never actually tried to produce a
resin of this level myself, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: been doing this for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it reminds me of some very well-grown
resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you that much, that fresh
frozen.
Really.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tap, make sure you're not losing any resin
other than what I've managed to lose on my
[SPEAKER_06]: glove there, which I'll be able to crack
and snap that right off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never a worry there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always get it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also a good idea why we wear the
gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: If this was on my fingers, it would be a
super nightmare.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sealed and sealed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last but certainly not least, we have our
45 and our 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our 45 is a real nice patty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came out real solid and lovely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fairly thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should hopefully microplane out nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: This microplane is definitely gummed up,
but working.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is usually more along the lines of
how a microplaning works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those other resins are just insanely
sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's actually allowing me to grip
the 45 and really grind it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that it is and can be a bit of
a messy job.
[SPEAKER_06]: The microplane is going to need a good
amount of cleaning after this,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get those pieces as small as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cleans the microplane up real nice when
you give it that little whack.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of feel that, uh-oh, I gummed it
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all ruined.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get it cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it a good whack.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is filling up nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say I'm definitely close to having to
clean this thing because it's barely
[SPEAKER_06]: planing at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little reverse planing there coming in
through the bottom of the plane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wherever I can access the little pieces of
bent metal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, if I can, like I've mentioned a
few times, I'll try to leave the right
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have the time and the temperature's
right, it really was that it was too warm
[SPEAKER_06]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about 14 or 15 degrees Celsius,
which must be around 70 or 75 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just warm enough to make some problems
with the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last real part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you can get it into this,
you know that your hash is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: drying properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a good thing to know once
you've, you know, grown a plant for
[SPEAKER_06]: several months, processed the whole thing
live, no trimming.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to know that you're doing it as
right as you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
45.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our 25, which I, you know,
because it's such a thin patty,
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll probably go into medibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just used all the room for the
one that I had for 25 and 45.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just place that right down on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one patty I've actually believed
could potentially dry without breaking it
[SPEAKER_06]: all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I don't suggest doing it, but if you
have to do it, it's not the end of the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna, it's gonna still turn out
fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, if you, if you have the
space in the room, great idea to break it
[SPEAKER_06]: all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't, the 25 micron is the one you
can kind of get away with without worrying
[SPEAKER_06]: about potential moisture problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicely microplained, spread, not quite as
thin as I like to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get a little bit more here than I
would have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have spread more out this way,
but it is on the parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is sealed in the box.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just like that, I've got my 220,
190, 160, 120, 90, 73, 45, and 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: All microplained up and all easily held in
a hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can place these wherever you want in
your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not gonna be getting dirt or dust,
dog hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not gonna be getting knocked over
by children.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are easily to put away and to leave
and to allow to dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The humidity is fairly high here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably looking at about 35,
40%.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get these into a room that is about
30% humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a dehumidifier downstairs and I
have the room sitting at about,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's in the coldest part of my
house, it's probably around 60,
[SPEAKER_06]: 65 degrees Fahrenheit right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where this stuff's going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first of my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna be running all my plants,
so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the first Astro Boy and I'm
drawing the cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe it's gonna be less than a
couple of ounces.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks, you know, it barely fits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fills the inside of the pizza box and
even today it was shrunk down quite a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes it our assumptions of the
higher yield that we thought we were gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: get.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that prohibition-based mindset
sneaking in, even with me and John,
[SPEAKER_06]: always thinking that, oh, we're gonna get
this much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna get that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will get what's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know you're efficient and you know
the job that you're doing, you know how to
[SPEAKER_06]: do it, you will get what's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the final thing I'm gonna show you on
all of this is I'm gonna show you some
[SPEAKER_06]: macro photographs of the final product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to show you some melt videos of the
final product and then we're going to,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess these will be separate parts from
this video.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the final part of this video.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next video I'm going to show coconut
oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take the material that I
have, wrap it in a cheesecloth,
[SPEAKER_06]: put it up to a very, very low boil,
like just a boil inside a double boiler.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heat that coconut oil up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll stick the cheesecloth in there with
the plant matter and we'll steep.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can soak that, I mean, in a crock pot
you can leave it up to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get the job done in about two to
three hours just on a stovetop and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what we're gonna do next on the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope you guys are loving this stuff
and there's more to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
Who knows?
