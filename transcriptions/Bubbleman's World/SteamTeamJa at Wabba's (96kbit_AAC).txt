[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here with Kevin from Steam
Team Jamaica, the original vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Steam Chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been, never smoked or
vaporized from a unit like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't believe it until you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly is the original vaporizer that
all these volcanoes and other units that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come years later, this is the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting in Wabas Ganja Field at the Blue
Hole is not too bad either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some six-star bubble
hash dabs on top of the Steam Chalice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing with the Steam Team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a J.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really hard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that cold and melting
deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks to the bubble hash niceness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and if you want to forget this Steam
Chalice, you can always check out www
[SPEAKER_01]: .steamteamja.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes the vaping experience much,
much nicer, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one at home that I got out here
that I quite enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of getting used to the
procedures of having the husk,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to create the coal,
being able to, you know, keep your coochie
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and take care of the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, changing the water out of the
coconut's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't leave that in there for
too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke throughout a day,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, dump out water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of it like you would take care
of any pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we keep it fresh and keep it with a
fresh load, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks for blazing up with the Steam
Team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, respect me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the greens upon the scene,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the greens upon the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're surrounded by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wonderful tastes, smells in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit another little bub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do one with the metal one that I
can shoot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll do a next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going in again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give thanks for another day above
ground, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link up with the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about we tourers, Steam Team JA
Tourists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in on some action with the dab,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Steaming and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little six-star bubble hash in your
bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little supercharged steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one will make you have a stun up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: One up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly organic vibration, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true the kind of real cloudy like I
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strictly sentimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strictly sentimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The song called leaders deceive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, obligate.
