[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually at the Pearson International
Airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: I flew in a couple of hours ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you that pay attention to the
Facebook page, you might have seen my
[SPEAKER_10]: funny little quote about our last trip
back home from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: John and I ended up going through
security, and security was just being
[SPEAKER_10]: unbelievably difficult with me for no
apparent reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, no, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end, they found a knife kind of
like a razor blade I had brought for
[SPEAKER_10]: taking clones while in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended up in the wrong bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of made a mention, like,
can we hurry this up?
[SPEAKER_10]: And she got snappy with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it started.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in the end of it, after she sort of
went over my stuff with a fine tooth comb
[SPEAKER_10]: and John was very much in pain standing
there watching, he finally kind of lost it
[SPEAKER_10]: and told the girl she was a fucking bitch,
at which point she pushed the button,
[SPEAKER_10]: called the police, security, airport,
everything, and then proceeded to tell me,
[SPEAKER_10]: you said that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, what?
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, you said that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it was just this big sort of silly
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: John and I got, well, it was our puff
time, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an hour that we would have spent
vaporizing before our flight that we ended
[SPEAKER_10]: up getting searched, hardcore,
interviewed by the police, interviewed by
[SPEAKER_10]: the airport security, finally allowed to
get on the plane.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, that was the last time I was in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm here again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually heading to Jamaica tomorrow
morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be flying into the Norman Manley
International Airport in Kingston,
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to try and film a little bit
differently this time for you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if I'm going to be visiting
any big ganja fields, although that seems
[SPEAKER_10]: silly to say because almost definitely
I'll end up visiting some really big ganja
[SPEAKER_10]: fields.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if not, I want to show you a little
bit of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to be showing just different
things that I might not otherwise show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to get to a reggae concert.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to interview a couple of friends
of mine that are in fairly well-known
[SPEAKER_10]: bands out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, you know, show you as much
ganja and hash as possible, which brings
[SPEAKER_10]: me to the moment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just realized this window doesn't open
here at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got myself a pure hash joint right
here in the straw.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I figured we could go outside and puff
this, have a little bit more of a talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll leave you guys because it's
already midnight here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to wake up early in about six hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: I suspect it'll be about five hours after
this joint and get myself on a plane and
[SPEAKER_10]: fly to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a four hour flight from Toronto,
so not too bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about a four hour flight for me to
get here as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So eight hours total with a beautiful
hotel room in between.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the Pearson Airport behind me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't you guys come with me?
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go inside and smoke this joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to find a lighter actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys, let's go for a walk here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice and close to the elevator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I like it.
Booyah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Going down and going up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, look, I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I got the pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: See if we can't find someone out there to
smoke it with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, I was on the second floor,
so.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way out.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I am literally right across
the street from the airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I don't think I'm too far from
where John and I had our session the last
[SPEAKER_10]: time we were here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that a small world if it is,
or is it over here or is it down one
[SPEAKER_10]: level?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to have to go find a
smoker.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am in the very same spot that John and I
met up with all those cool people and
[SPEAKER_10]: talked to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they don't want us smoking anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we have a license, we go to the smoking
area and we're OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: We go over there, and then it's like,
hey, what are you doing?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go for a little walk with
this joint, so we'll see you guys in a
[SPEAKER_10]: bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just walking through the arrival part of
the airport, puffing my doobie.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are smelling it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll go for a little walk here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There sure is a huge airport here in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could get lost so easily.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a monster.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to walk around for a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back walking at the airport.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a whole lot of people that just
smelled some nice, fine cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, kind of boring one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watching me just walk around the airport
here in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is where I am for now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Puffing pure hash joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't got my buddy John here this time,
so I'm on my own.
[SPEAKER_10]: Solo styles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is OK as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's nice to go on a little trip
by yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's late.
[SPEAKER_10]: My joint's a roach.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll catch you guys tomorrow morning as we
board the plane for Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here at the Spanish Court Hotel in
Kingston, Jamaica, chilling out with Giddy
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been dabbing the ship.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is Pel√© in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've been dabbing on our friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: Giddy's got the live resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubble Man's got the fresh headings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a little bit of gyps, the melts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I brought some dry sift as well that I
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we're just hitting it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been dabbing up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought while these guys were doing
it, we should show a little bit of this
[SPEAKER_10]: party that we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the vibes are good here in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to the prophecy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prophecy, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch for prophecy, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you on Bubble Man's World,
we're going to play a little bit of this
[SPEAKER_10]: song for you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the latest track.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what I'm talking about,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every night it's like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ain't in Jamaica, you ain't having
as much fun as me.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is no fucking possible place.
[SPEAKER_10]: I turned my hotel room into a cure room.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been weed curing in my hotel the
whole time I've been here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't even open my door without
spitting out the whole row of this hotel.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in chill.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know where the best is from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else up here to dab?
Dang commander.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time we come down, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: And cameraman Bird is definitely going to
dab it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bird from Apex.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys got to check out these pens.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be talking with Bird later on about
those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know if I'd call them a pen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they might need a new name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only here to do with purpose of
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingston Ninja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninja dab, ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica, baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: See these little guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: These little guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the heads, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you're singing about.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what the herb is about.
[SPEAKER_10]: The current, the flow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great line, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet track.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to continue to dab our faces
off here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got some other friends coming over
later on, the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're hopefully going to hook up with
Jeff Ifree Bueller, a friend we met
[SPEAKER_10]: through Facebook that hangs out with Kidis
Eye and the In of the Yard crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's really into the moringa,
and he's going to sort of give us a
[SPEAKER_10]: download on that tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So talk to you guys later, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay iry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome back to Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still here at the Spanish Court
Hotel, chilling out with Giddy,
[SPEAKER_10]: Pele, Bird, our good boy Fligos off
camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to lean in, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bringing the prophecy here for us to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_10]: So good.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to do little dabby dabbies
for some waking banks.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a good day today.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get out into Kingston.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go look at some places.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here basically doing what everyone's
doing, sniffing around, trying to get
[SPEAKER_10]: involved in this cannabis industry that's
about to erupt here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys have already decriminalized for
under two ounces.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so guys like myself and Giddy,
who have the ability to extract resins off
[SPEAKER_10]: of plants using proprietary technology,
we're... Interested, baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hit a little Astro Boy from
my mentor Ron Hickey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Ron Hickey and Proctor BC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thinking of you here at Kingston,
brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready for one of those, Bird?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: First one of the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a little wakey wakey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Time to bake these.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, then we'll talk about this Apex
pen because I'm pretty stoked about that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bird's created his own pen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do mean created.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the first ones I've seen that
hasn't been just an absolute rip-off of
[SPEAKER_10]: every other pen out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's actually unique and different.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm showing it to you guys in a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that it doesn't have any lights so
I can get into movie theater without
[SPEAKER_03]: attracting attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's crank that fan up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it up, do it up, do it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is brand new, right?
What's the price?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your favorite part about your paper
ball.
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I've had, what's that getting?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your favorite part about your paper
ball?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'd have to make it a two part.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go with the people and the
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the resin isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, which is funny for him to say that
because this particular Astro Boy,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is a very, very tasty strain,
Ron being OCD like he is was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: he didn't want to let it not dry properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he left it on the cardboard for three
months for a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other strain would have no taste at
all, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even when I first saw it, I was like,
I was like, oh no, oh no.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the smell was still there and the
flavors still hit you when you rip it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been amazing this trip to
get to sample a lot of the wares from
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: The locals have been great and it's going
to be a fun day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I say I've been coming here a long time
with the folks, these guys that I've
[SPEAKER_10]: hooked up with now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_10]: To feel like you have family in Jamaica as
opposed to like buddies or friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard a lot of things about Kingston
before I traveled here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was quicker to like than Denver was
when I moved there.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you spill a little bit of hash in
Jamaica, you got to dab it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just puffing the hell out of this
non-smoking room.
[SPEAKER_10]: So actually, if you want to tell us a
little bit about your pen burn,
[SPEAKER_10]: that would be the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll put prophecy back on.
All right.
Pass.
[SPEAKER_10]: We get puff puff passing while Bert gives
us the.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on everybody from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful country.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kingston, the place to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely amazed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: This place, everyone's so nice and
amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm already booking my next trip tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is our Apex pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up to market about almost a year now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We already changed the design and it's
basically we like to dab and we like to
[SPEAKER_11]: travel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need something that's adequate for
us.
[SPEAKER_11]: On par with dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I can't have something that's
going to be bringing in my pocket or in my
[SPEAKER_11]: bags, getting thrown around by TSA or
whoever it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we come out with an all metal product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right out of the box, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's nice little unit right there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's battery life on those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like forty eight hundred years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this is an all ready to go
package.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you get your silicone container.
[SPEAKER_11]: You get your globe with your wax piece.
[SPEAKER_11]: You get your dryer, your pre-filled
lithium ion battery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four day charge on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four day charge.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're on the go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on the go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there's no battery charger and then
the mod.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also comes with your stencil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is such a nice little tool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one in every room of my house.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got to say, I saw these guys hitting
it the other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, of course, have my trippy stick,
which I still love with the glass chamber.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really impressed with this unit in
the sense that it wasn't a copy of all the
[SPEAKER_10]: pens that already exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually seemed like innovation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it actually seemed like what Bird was
trying to do was rather than just get in
[SPEAKER_10]: on the market and make some money.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was improving the quality of this pen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you these hit like almost no
pen I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I'm super stoked to be fucking
using mine, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys will be able to check those out
on freshheadies.com real soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right away, if you want to check them
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apex.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apexpen.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apexpen.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apex.
[SPEAKER_10]: We put it together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ganja is not there to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I finally put them away, but then there
was nothing in them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I found this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just hit the other half of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not half.
[SPEAKER_10]: You hit 90% of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy's a fiend.
[SPEAKER_10]: He sniffed it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jibs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bruce Banner, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to keep puffing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eating merengue seeds like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll tell you about merengue seeds
later on when we link up with Kittis and
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to take us out later tonight
for some tunes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe to a local river.
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, I think we're going to go look
at properties.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And office space and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know how long you're going to
stay in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be a little while.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching Bulb Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be a little while.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are now rolling tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got Michael and Bird.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your name again, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Brent and Richie in the front.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, driving us through Kingston.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, listening to some Jesse
Royal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You like Jesse Royal, Richie?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a good artist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like what he sings.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a good message.
[SPEAKER_10]: You feel good when you're re-singing those
lyrics.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the things as artists that
it's important sometimes if you're trying
[SPEAKER_10]: to sing consciously that you want other
people to feel good when they're singing
[SPEAKER_10]: your lyrics.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or at least you want them to think.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right here in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Bulb Man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bulb Man and Richie.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bird and Brent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Snatcha.
[SPEAKER_10]: Snatcha.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's representing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your name's Snatcha?
[SPEAKER_12]: Snatcha.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, the pineapple truck.
[SPEAKER_10]: See that pineapple truck, Bird?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just full of pineapples.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some real wealth right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are back in the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listening to Richie's new tune,
The Herbs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the idea that this song is from
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully, maybe this trip we're gonna
get a plan to help film a video for Richie
[SPEAKER_10]: for this song.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's what we gotta do.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been talking to Tony about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony's already got a good outline.
[SPEAKER_10]: For the song.
[SPEAKER_10]: To show it in a really good light.
[SPEAKER_10]: To show the medicinal purposes of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it outside of just the smoking to get
high.
[SPEAKER_10]: And really show that more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: More than one reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know the one reason already.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we want to share the more than one
reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just smoking, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The creams and the salves and the patches
and the little oils.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Soap.
Soap.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plastics.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, even concrete.
[SPEAKER_10]: Making plastics out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They say over 50,000 commercial products
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I've personally seen hemp metal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hemp metal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stronger than titanium and lead.
[SPEAKER_10]: And lighter than aluminum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_10]: To cut through glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so this stuff is out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamaica's getting on board with first
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna see more things come out of
Jamaica here in the upcoming years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Jamaica as being a real contender in
the... I mean, what country has been
[SPEAKER_10]: promoting ganja and ganja use more through
the model of reggae music and guys like
[SPEAKER_10]: Richie?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you guys know Richie,
you know his songs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got some good cannabis songs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like one of the anthems.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the top three anthems up there with
Legalize It and Sizzla's got it right
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it right here.
Man,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is a very impressive moment to be
able to come out to a country and the
[SPEAKER_11]: welcome mat that was extended is on next
level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, it's a total next level welcome mat.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an incredible crew of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of them have just been the super guy,
like real friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it goes from the politicians right
down to the musicians.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And all at once.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we were in the meeting and it's
like the band's here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The politics are here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and they're all unified.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Unity in Jamaica with Bird from Apex,
Bubble Man, Fresh Hetties.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The snake gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that dank commander.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to try CBD and CVM at the same
time?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a muscle monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fucking Usain Bolt with a joint rolling
over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Done.
[SPEAKER_10]: How was that, Prophecy?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a different type of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, with your other wrist.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's CBD and CVM, so it's like very good
kind of muscle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make your hands go numb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony bringing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drops.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is used for mostly relaxing the
muscle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you have spasms like in your back
or you have spasms anywhere or if you
[SPEAKER_08]: needed, and it's CBD too, so good for
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for seeing, good for spasms,
good for inflammation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you pull him out a little dab?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's pulling you out one right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prophecy is going to dab Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got your song on the...
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's put it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the puff puffs?
[SPEAKER_08]: PR.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way I like to do that is what you
have.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pull this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a little more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little bigger guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you take this.
[SPEAKER_10]: D-A-B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, D-A-B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right at the start.
[SPEAKER_10]: D-A-B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prophecy is about to dab Tony down with a
little of the melts from Jibs.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the mothership and the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice secondhand cough.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, puff and cough.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a line of the song, Prophecy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right into the split.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the non-smoking room.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a non-smoking room that we're
smoking down pretty tough right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn that on.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is hold this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just hold this in your hand and
there's no more smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call it a smoking body.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just hold it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Blow through it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blow a big smokey joint hit through it.
[SPEAKER_08]: How am I supposed to smoke through it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_10]: It trapped the smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's trippy.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's crank it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That button right there, Tony.
[SPEAKER_10]: The white handle.
[SPEAKER_10]: The white controller.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just push the power button on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I hate air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Air conditioning is not good for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the wall too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can make it go faster there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: it looks like Prophecy knows what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got a rub.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back up.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where we're getting a CRD spot for
us to puff bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: A dab spot for all our buddies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all we need.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need a spot where we can all be
dabbed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a giant pothole.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like one of the ones you see in
the country when a cow gets hit on the
[SPEAKER_10]: road or a horse.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just bury it?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they burn it with tires on top of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the tires burn through the
concrete and make a giant hole like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think they would do that up
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is the building.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just got to a friend's property
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's building up a really beautiful three
quarters of an acre.
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes all the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's right over here by the vehicles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it goes down into this corner here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a potential property we could
be looking at if we made our way out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ganja's not a thing to fool the mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make me chip out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to hear crystals?
