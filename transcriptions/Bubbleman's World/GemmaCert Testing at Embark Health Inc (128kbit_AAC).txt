[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm here with Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're over here at Embark, and we're going
to be using the Gamma Sert today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some, listen, I should say right
away, we're just playing with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all the comments of people
saying it's a scam, it doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be testing Black Cherry
Punch today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have an HPLC COA for this flower
that we're going to be testing it against,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're just checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to see what kind of numbers
we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to log in to the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use your fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get the password going
here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just give the unit a little
wipe down here as it's, what's it doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's just warming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the unit's got to warm up to
temperature before it'll actually let me
[SPEAKER_02]: calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, then it calibrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can start playing with putting
the stuff into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll check out what kind of,
what kind of action we have with the Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like really nice bud and it
smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been making really beautiful bubble
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect it's all going to go quite
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the unit's warming up and
getting soon to be calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Dan has just placed the flower on
the little pin and it will show you what
[SPEAKER_00]: this does in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heads on to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using light and a reflective
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically, I mean, how would you
explain it Dan?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically- It's using the reflection
of light off the trichome to measure how
[SPEAKER_02]: many, how much your cannabinoid content
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then goes to a database to test
against already tested HPLC numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not like going to be exactly
accurate, but I have heard some people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when it's not accurate,
there are so many ways, if you bump the
[SPEAKER_00]: table, if there's vibration in the room,
if there's too much anything- The door
[SPEAKER_00]: opens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can affect your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see a lot of people saying these
things don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to get my own firsthand
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to the people at Gamacert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've explained it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather Dan and I go through,
use this thing, test 20 or 30 batches,
[SPEAKER_00]: test it against HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material has been tested against
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was 21.2% THC when it came
back from the HPLC test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll see what we'll get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to do a ground test
and test it as powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see how we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost done warming up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've changed over to calibration now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being very careful when you're using this,
I would say some of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: factors of using this unit is to not bump
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to open the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to have blaring music going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to really make sure that in no way,
shape, or form do you bump or bang this
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's calibrating or while it's
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that generally can cause a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's probably the number one
factor in Wi-Fi, why there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people on our last post that we're saying
these don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have extremely good SOPs and
hyper awareness of not banging the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's conducive to take this
units to events and have a table with
[SPEAKER_00]: people standing in front of your table and
testing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much better to have in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using it in any way,
shape, or form as the word of God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can get this thing going and
calibrated properly where we can test our
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and some of our flour without having
to send it off right away and have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of where that sits, it doesn't have to be
the word of God for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're certainly testing everything in our
facility through HPLC at third party labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that do all of our testing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a cool technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad there's companies like Gamma Sur
trying to put this technology out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not for you, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy one, don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is something that you think might
fit into your lab space, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing these videos for educational
purposes to let people know how we found
[SPEAKER_00]: that it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what this video is for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're on to the next part of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the unit here, it'll basically give you
your run through of what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's telling us to lift the drawer up
and then hit okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna lift
this drawer nice and light and nice and be
[SPEAKER_02]: gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This machine is, it's a scientific
machine, so gentle and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says hit okay, so we're gonna hit okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what it's gonna do is it's gonna
calibrate with the drawer open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll take a couple more seconds,
do its calibration here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once that's done, it's gonna tell
me to put the butt in the drawer and close
[SPEAKER_02]: it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calibrated, so now we're gonna touch
analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that I have this on the pin
already, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: look for the frostier side that doesn't
have a whole bunch of leaf and doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any stem sticking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna choose this side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff's pretty frosty and pretty well
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes upside down into this machine,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little magnetic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a yellow dot on the side of
this machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This yellow dot is supposed to be lined up
center on our bud that we're wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think we wanna be moving
this unit at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're gonna wanna do is we're
gonna wanna drop this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the littlest bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll get it into that halfway
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then rotate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say it looked like it turned
around on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now anything that's fallen debris-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can brush out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get your brush, pull that debris out
of there and off the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, what they want us to do is
we're gonna touch this picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna take a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes into the final results,
the scan results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we get for our numbers
will be attached in the account that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good frame of reference to know
what you're testing rather than... I often
[SPEAKER_00]: look at COAs and there's no picture of the
flower whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of... This little
white spot you see my finger not coming
[SPEAKER_02]: close to but pointing at, that's your
counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calibration screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never touch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to clean it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're gonna drop this drawer nice
and slow and lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that we're not dropping it
at the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're dropping it onto a little
robot that's gonna be rolling around the
[SPEAKER_02]: little spectrometer light that's gonna be
doing our reading for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from there, we're gonna hit percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna hit the analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this will go for about three
to four minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll come back and we'll show you
what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Marcus just stepped out of
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna get this before it shuts
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the unit saying it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually saying a little bit of low
water activity on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna measure that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're gonna do is we're gonna hit
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna pull our drawer up ever so
slightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get to this spot here,
we can get our results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get our results until this drawer
has actually been lifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're gonna do from here is we're
gonna tap onto the result button.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like less than 1% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's .9% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 21.2%, the total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta say, this is some of our most
accurate that we've found so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were doing it in a very loud
room, people banging the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day at the collector's cup,
we were getting numbers in the 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, 15, 16, and 17 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, compared to an HPLC, I can show the
COA for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 21.2% and what we got is 20.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less than 1% off, which I have to
say is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm extremely impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're testing against this COA
from an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is on a non-ground flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll probably do another test with
this where we grind the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's pretty darn cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: From here, we're gonna take the same bud
and we're gonna do a ground test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna go into mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already clicked on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you click your ground and then you go
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we're gonna have to do is we're
gonna have to calibrate the unit for the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what they would use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put all your ground up, bud,
into this little... Show them how to open
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna spin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice glass wall in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white edge is always gonna be your
zero for the spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna take that,
slide it into the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice thing about this machine,
you don't gotta worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's magnetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pulls it right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
slide this door down nice and light again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna hit... Can we put it right
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even a little more over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, put it on that way, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna hit calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calibrate it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calibrate to ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it's saying ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no ground in there right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's gotta calibrate down to that
first white screens on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's already warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already at 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna go directly into
calibrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're gonna grind up some flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna grind up the exact same bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna grind the exact same bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll take these buds and we'll
throw them into the reactor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna pull out as much of this stem
as I can while I'm doing this so that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not getting a big stem reading off
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we're done the grind, it's done the
stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That calibration for the downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna lift
the drawer and we're gonna hit okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's gonna calibrate drawer open.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, then we'll come back and throw
that ground flower in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're done calibrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone back to this normal mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna take the unit out and push
down on these two black green tabs
[SPEAKER_02]: downwards and then it'll rotate up nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cover that little window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what we're gonna do is you wanna
make sure you're putting it on a soft
[SPEAKER_02]: surface so you're not scratching that
glass on the outside because that will
[SPEAKER_02]: affect your reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're gonna do is we're gonna fill
up the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any over spillage or anything,
you're just gonna push it back down onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the glass anyway so you don't have to be
too crazy careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But make sure you're getting all those,
look at all that Christy sitting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of that buster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wanna make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're getting all this kind of stuff
mixed in otherwise you're not gonna get a
[SPEAKER_02]: proper test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a proper emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from here what I would do is I would
take something like a stem or something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not gonna scratch your screen and
actually mix the butt up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can tell how many crystals are
sitting on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lightly pack it all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get our brush out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna get our brush out to clean
up and do a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to take the back of the
brush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kinda make things a little even in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're gonna take your little screen,
your little white, make sure white down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will lock into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that's gonna do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna press all of it up against the
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not getting only flour up
against there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again it's magnetic so it'll place itself
into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go analyze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please insert ground flour and take your
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna take our picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna insert our drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna hit the analyze button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be back with the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the results in but to get the
results you gotta lift the drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta lift the drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna take the drawer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like ground wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're gonna hit the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every number is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: From ground to the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an accurate number today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta say I'm pretty happy with those
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the flour twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did this time is we were OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came to a room that no one's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We removed the table from the wall because
there was vibration on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a concrete floor so there's no
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've eliminated the door opening and
blowing wind into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no music playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not touching the table in any way
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time I feel like we're
getting accurate numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and Bubble Man coming at you from
Embark Health, Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll
continue to bring you more tests with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gamma Cert as we get more flour to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
See you next time.
