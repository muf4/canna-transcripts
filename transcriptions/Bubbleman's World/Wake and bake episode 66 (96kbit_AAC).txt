of that really now How do I feel how does
[SPEAKER_00]: it feel just being next to elites well,
it's nerve-wracking I mean if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting next to a pipe that cost someone
50 or 60 racks you have a real serious
[SPEAKER_00]: level of Responsibility if you will you
want to be very careful with that I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the last video where we saw buddy

[SPEAKER_00]: bringing glass to Jamaica ever once
Jamaica's pretty cool when it really comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest I Don't want to be in the
same room as a 50k pipe my friend Hillary
[SPEAKER_00]: used to just say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be like no no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you I'd go to pass her the big crazy
piece, and she'd just be like I am okay
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need it Yeah, that was a tank wasn't
it hey there was another tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do next time we'll do another one
There's one with flab 421 where he does a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts the he puts the mothership Debbie
Marcel Right down on top of a glass jar
[SPEAKER_00]: like bang like it is crazy so cool and
calm doesn't even look I'm like after the
[SPEAKER_00]: video shot I'm like looking at the piece
like trying to make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just so chill I guess that's how it
is sometimes when you just don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: fucks to give if you have no fucks to give
There are no fucks to give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes alright,
so Let's do this shall we a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a rippy dip in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow No, I don't think so at all Sean I
don't remember where anyone said you were
[SPEAKER_00]: useless if you useless if you get
worthless if you can't at a $50,000 pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a big one
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the secondary hit from that was Oh
Right spilt that again did I I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: spilling my my little jar full of cleaner
There we go god.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way this shit cleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous Such a nice way to clean
the pipe it really is a bonus
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent Drew, and you should be
perfectly happy with your $75 rig
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, you know have someone having a
nice rig should certainly not take away
[SPEAKER_00]: anything from someone's you know plain and
simple rig I mean I drive a pretty plain
[SPEAKER_00]: truck and When I'm driving in Vancouver,
and I see all these kids literally kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving around in super cars like
McLaren's and Galardo's and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: craziest cars you could ever imagine I
feel great for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never feel bad about myself I never feel
bad about my own vehicle and that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: up to par I think to myself man those
those guys are in their 20s, and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive a car like that good for them
That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to do the whole keeping up with
the Jones's thing in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know just Acquire the things that you
want to acquire and don't feel too bad
[SPEAKER_00]: about us other people's acquirements It's
like when I fly I get I fly coach 99% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fly first class very often and
Would be interested in Printed articles on
[SPEAKER_00]: hash church HD panelists and bubble man's
world knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure grant You sent me the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very nice offer I'm trying to
figure out what I can I can get printed at
[SPEAKER_00]: your company I'm really not too sure we'll
have to talk about it in Person,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get it returned to you and I
just haven't really been able to think
[SPEAKER_00]: other than maybe some pamphlets or flyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure who knows I like the idea
There's a guy well, we've got our own Rob
[SPEAKER_00]: Moore who's been doing funny cartoons But
what I really liked is these cartoons that
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that a guy was doing for Joe Rogan
And it's basically really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the three or four or two of them
sitting around the table and he's just
[SPEAKER_00]: created a cartoon of The actual voices so
he's taking their real voices and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into the cartoon I'm gonna see
if Rob Moore can do a little of that even
[SPEAKER_00]: just some of the most magical powerful You
know one two minute three minute things
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen on hash church if we could get
a cartoon of that made up and a Collection
[SPEAKER_00]: of those cartoons made up and I'm not
looking for the funny sounds and the like
[SPEAKER_00]: the comedy aspect of it I think that's
great, but I'm talking about something
[SPEAKER_00]: very different something that's us in
caricature form talking in the hash church
[SPEAKER_00]: panels and sort of you know with with this
breakdown of whatever we happen to be
[SPEAKER_00]: saying because you guys know the knowledge
drops aren't Consistent they happen there
[SPEAKER_00]: are little gems that get dropped here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hopefully we can ask Rob about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of of getting something
like that I saw these Joe Rogan ones and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought this is a great way to share
information It's hard to share a four-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: hash church, but imagine like Jessica
Hawkins Telling the story about Naya first
[SPEAKER_00]: trying cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that is Yeah, you know what alpha
beta you know where I'm at So I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a cool idea I know Rob's not in
the room right now Otherwise, he would
[SPEAKER_00]: always already be replying but we'll hit
him up and we'll see what's going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see if we can't get some of those
More serious cartoons done up because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's a great way to share First of
all, the knowledge that is being shared
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes is very let's say not a joke
It's it's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very serious, but it would be nice to
sort of You know paint it up in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts it into a cartoon So you can get
these serious knowledge drops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time kind of be watching a
little cartoon I don't know if you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: saw the one recently where vice put it up
and it was Ninja from die Antwoord word
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess he's telling the story of
going over to Kanye West's house and
[SPEAKER_00]: playing basketball with Drake It's a funny
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it all in this cartoon form and I
like that I thought it was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen a similar thing prior and someone
had even Mocked that they had jacked it
[SPEAKER_00]: from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to give vice the credit
I'm sure it was someone else's before vice
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this concept an idea, but it was
pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me think man I love the idea of
having I would love to be able to tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: story like that and then have an
Cartoonist be able to produce a cartoon
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it because we got some hilarious
stories I mean the hash church series a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot I mean most of them really just have
incredible stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all incredible people So why
wouldn't they have incredible stories even
[SPEAKER_00]: d4 20k?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's been quiet lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you have some really crazy
crazy stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah Yes, Charlie Murphy, there you go Well,
Charlie Murphy's dead our IP rest in peace
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie Murphy, I was happy to puff a bowl
with Charlie and sit one evening just
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky enough, you know, it was through
Mark Cloak heat He was having his event
[SPEAKER_00]: the kush cup and he always hired these
guys to come and be there I was never one
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and meet, you know these guys I
would not try to get my way in I always
[SPEAKER_00]: felt the energy was awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told Mark that I would come with my
wife and we would watch the show and So we
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the end of the show of Charlie Show
and then Mark was like, oh here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll you know sit back here It's a little
more private and he had this little table
[SPEAKER_00]: in a corner and so my wife and I sat there
and It ended up being Charlie Murphy and
[SPEAKER_00]: his bodyguard who traveled with him all
the time big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember his name Sat down with us
and it was pretty fucking cool to have
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie Murphy at a table with just my
wife and his bodyguard telling stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know telling we kind of got into the
true Hollywood stories and the Chappelle's
[SPEAKER_00]: show and and what it was like being Eddie
Murphy's brother in the 80s like holy shit
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Murphy was our rock star in the 80s,
man I'm telling you maybe late 70s
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever Whenever that stand-up that he
did came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I'm brain farting the name
but Yeah, Eddie Murphy's stand-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure someone's gonna put it up right
away, but Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think comedy should stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if Charlie Murphy came up with
that he should absolutely Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Murphy raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of paused out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you know, I'm smoking on a
variety of things I'm just finishing up
[SPEAKER_00]: that Justin Trudeau Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think that's what's gonna go
down in the next ball It's kind of amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: how much was stuck in this little jar
myself one more little dab there probably
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go in for a turp dip because well,
I Can it's hard not to when you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: Flaves give thanks to Tony V for this
beautiful little gift not the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves all they'll thank him for That
as well, but this little case with the
[SPEAKER_00]: carabiner I'm telling you he gave me this
one year in Amsterdam and I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: remember maybe it was Barcelona I don't
remember I was watching some of the videos
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2014 and we were talking about You
know, we were hitting some of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: turp melt some of the first terpenes added
to hashish That I had ever known about
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, you know from that we're going,
you know soon to be available I'd never
[SPEAKER_00]: tried Cannabis profile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always just single terpenes that
were you know, the food grade ones that I
[SPEAKER_00]: now really don't suggest to people that
They inhale those into their lungs Are you
[SPEAKER_00]: independently wealthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you support all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I support all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a very personal question I
guess I am independently wealthy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that I came to British Columbia with
$6,000 to my name that's how much money I
[SPEAKER_00]: had when I moved here and So now I have
about $7,000 But I have a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked hard Bubble bags was very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to me over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost 20 years that we've been
selling bubble bags and Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's all what people's versions of
wealthy is when I hear wealthy I always I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I obviously feel that if you're
living in North America generally because
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have you know Friends that have grown
up in ghettos if you're living in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America Generally, even the way I grew up
which would have been in a lot with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less cash You still are wealthy to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say You know if you can afford
shoes, you know to some that's wealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Feel like I did and still have and am
and I do appreciate you guys for the
[SPEAKER_00]: support purchasing bubble bags and dry
sift screens And all those little tools
[SPEAKER_00]: that we sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely been very helpful Live on
SD SSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it every day as long as you can Yeah,
you have a gabba dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very You know Adverse to working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of working right now All right

iCloud dot com Dry sift is 70 you for my
[SPEAKER_00]: screens 110 lines per inch

[SPEAKER_00]: Who did that taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoo, I forgot I dipped it in Karma's
bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there Kaylee Mmm, man I know hanky
boy, you know The only reason I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't or don't is because it's a pain in
the ass Every morning I go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of solventless mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He we've talked He said he would come on
But he's probably sleeping in I'm up
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't always line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I Definitely thought about it this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought how cool also I've been doing
all of these on my phone that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: given me the freedom to do them as well as
Almost anywhere as I have been doing them
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't even need the internet to
do them That being said if I invite a
[SPEAKER_00]: guest on I have to do it through my
computer Because there's no way for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: send the live link when I go through my
phone It actually is going live through
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube and when I go live through the
computer It goes live through Google live
[SPEAKER_00]: Google chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just so freaking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a very delicious All right,
I'm getting texts from mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: T While this is going on I Think I am
going to be at the Karma Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to Sarah I have to yet to give
her a Solid yes, but I'm wanting to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have a good time at the Karma Cup
Sarah does a good job it's a nice event
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess you know the bottom line is
she really brings people out like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people came by a lot of people checked out
my booth it's a worthwhile experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: you know small companies like Blue River
and the many others to go there and show
[SPEAKER_00]: their wares and You know do a decent
amount of business because these trips
[SPEAKER_00]: cost money You're gonna end up spending
close to a grand on a hotel and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: close to a grand on a on a flight so and
if you Have to pay for a two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: grand for a booth Now you have to do about
seven to eight thousand dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: business To make that all pay off now keep
in mind if you did a little bit less Even
[SPEAKER_00]: if it cost you a couple grand There's the
advertising aspect of it the same way you
[SPEAKER_00]: might do an ad in a magazine going there
if it cost you money At least you were
[SPEAKER_00]: there you were seen you know, you got
people to see what you were all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ooh quality hash, I'm not too sure good
morning Abraham All right on Jay cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, dude, well, hopefully it'll be there
again and we'll be able to my booth was
[SPEAKER_00]: super simple It's funny that you would say
it's awesome because really all my booth
[SPEAKER_00]: was was a table a Little sort of sheet
laid down and then some turps on top with
[SPEAKER_00]: us hitting bowls So I guess that's just
all you got to do to have an awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your kindness but We sure
didn't go out of the way and spend too
[SPEAKER_00]: much money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the properly made full melt hash will
have a dry consistency like sand even it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a bunch of turkeys well full melt hash
can be made into a sand like consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but If it's allowed to yes, I've been to
why is false if it's a lot been allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: Get warm It will congeal and melt into a
solid puck for sure every chance that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can get Jah freedom in says Alan Shinberg
I'm it's nice that bingo Lombardi won
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great to recognize his name Um,
I'm not too sure no, I have not none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Although I would check out a seeds
they've got the exotics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Tigers Malik and the the what is
it called the the Roja Something Roja,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the Angola Angola Roja as well as
Congolese They've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nice exotic cultivars going on over
at a seeds Yeah, China white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some China white right here boom
going in Yeah a seeds I always give those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys the Angola red yeah, I traded some
Angola red I believe it was something like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Vangie Hayes crossed with the the
Angola Roja the Angola red that produced
[SPEAKER_00]: the Congo I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say anything that's wrong
but back in the day quite a while ago when
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally traded my some bubble bags
for some seeds from Reina Genga Reina
[SPEAKER_00]: Genga was of course married to the mano
negra and the mano negra Who was Alex was
[SPEAKER_00]: the one who collected the original Congo
seeds in Africa that ended up here in?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Vancouver as well as all the way down
the coast in San Francisco as well I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: too sure Jay cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to say Yeah, it's a
horrible name for sure Nicholas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, you know, I don't have really a
big connection to heroin So it's not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as bad but yeah, I'm always opposed to
sort of like the chemo's and sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: just the you know the MK ultra all sorts
of names that are like man those are like
[SPEAKER_00]: some fucked up things to be naming that
after but What are you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, listen the way chimera put it and I
believe it and I think it's the future as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as that that The future of cannabis
is not these names that we know them by
[SPEAKER_00]: those might be secondary You know tags,
but really what they are going to be named
[SPEAKER_00]: is the constituents of which they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is The cannabinoid profile and
what is the terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two things that I really
want to know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to know every single one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not maybe initially it'll be just
you know, the dominance, you know These
[SPEAKER_00]: are the three dominant terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cultivar could be called,
you know, like chimera had here the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day the pine the lime and The terpenaline
say his didn't have it but say it had it
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have the top three or the top
two or the top one you could have dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and dominant Cannabinoid profiles
and I'm sure those things now specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes especially will show That they
are different in the Afghan grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: arid dry mountain range compared to the
tropical exotic narrow leaf drug cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: that is grown in an extremely humid area I
am convinced that the terpene profile will
[SPEAKER_00]: be specific for each of those areas and
that those Terpenes will be specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: say things like resisting powdery mildew
It might be a specific terpene that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to resist powdery mildew when
it's grown in the tropics versus Afghanis
[SPEAKER_00]: that just don't have that terpene profile
and because of it get these Mildews this
[SPEAKER_00]: is just a theory but it's one that fits in
my brain and I could see it coming true
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find the truth to all of
these questions in the very near future as
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more people are getting out of
school young people Going into university
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for jobs in the cannabis
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah mildew I Love when he says that
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a trip life is the hash is so
different, too Yeah, old man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever spray terpenes on a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I would not spray terpenes on a
plant you spelled episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, my phone actually Does a weird
autocorrect it does this thing and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it ellisode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a bad thing It's not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can change it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it is already changed Sam's the
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely Love the old-schoolers love
their stories, you know, absolutely Till
[SPEAKER_00]: they tell us we're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our theories are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite LSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is my favorite LSO,
too Well, no, it's not my favorite LSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that LSO like back about
23 LSOs that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was a kick-ass LSO for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean shit Yeah, as far as LSOs go that
was as solid as an LSO as as I had ever
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced in an LSO Just saying Any tips
for starting older seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know DJ short gave me this tip,
you know I do it just like ever regular do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're gonna do your soma method
in the water and your till it sinks or
[SPEAKER_00]: your Your your wet paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a couple of plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some moist towel it in I put the
seeds down and then I put it on like my
[SPEAKER_00]: stereo receiver and it just keeps it this
perfect temperature like not so warm that
[SPEAKER_00]: it dries the paper towel up but warm
enough that it It creates that warmth of
[SPEAKER_00]: like yeah, let's crack I crack 20 year old
seeds that way now if they don't crack
[SPEAKER_00]: What DJ short said to me is that he's
actually helped them crack with his
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually And he's imagine how gentle
you have to be to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of goes to show the level of
Passion that the man had but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would just give it a gentle gentle
pinch until the tip popped open or until
[SPEAKER_00]: he saw a slight crack and Yeah,
he's just cracking seeds with his hands I
[SPEAKER_00]: never was forced to do it But it's a great
tip from a guy who had a lot of old seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: back before I really knew anyone who had a
lot a lot of old seeds Well, Jay,
[SPEAKER_00]: Henrik's short DJ short has you know saved
some nice genetics doing it So it's a last
[SPEAKER_00]: resort But if you have to do it if it's
not going to crack normally because what I
[SPEAKER_00]: said was if you listen to me Try it all
normal first and if that doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can give it a little help That's
it DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me that while we were spinning a
batch of bubble hash in a school bus that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emory had rented and was driving
around the city of Vancouver not really it
[SPEAKER_00]: was leaving MPC or whatever cchq or the
other million names it's had ever since
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to a restaurant for the
Tokers Bowl But it seemed like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: driving around downtown Vancouver for a
while and me and DJ were mixing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine I had the five gallon bucket
started it actually in Mark's store in the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement at pot TV But then we're like
everyone we got to go and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the beauty of water hash
It's portable So I picked up the bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: with the water in the bud and the ice and
I just carried it onto The bus and we sat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the two front seats and we just gave it
a spinny min min and I remember we let it
[SPEAKER_00]: settle on the ride from there to Getting
to the restaurant and when we got to the
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant, we pulled the bags and
collected the hash so Wow very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know if there's there has to be
footage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who would have it I was
making hash so I didn't have my camera and
[SPEAKER_00]: we it was definitely a little Bit before
the time where we were like always had
[SPEAKER_00]: someone filming us So I would suspect
someone who was at the Tokers Bowl either
[SPEAKER_00]: the oh three or the oh four Tokers Bowl
might have footage of that Um was mark and
[SPEAKER_00]: me and I friends I'm not too sure about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known mark a long time I guess I
could innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've never really gone to
dinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always invited I think it was been a
more professional relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean I would call him a friend
In the sense that you know, I I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated what he was doing in the
community back in the day for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: money he was donating to people that were
getting in trouble for growing his seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and His store was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was donating all the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't keeping it He was just putting
it back putting it into the activists
[SPEAKER_00]: hands and promoting events and he was just
kind of doing cool shit So I liked him in
[SPEAKER_00]: that sense, but he was always more
business, you know, I wrote for the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine for years So he was my editor As
well as Jody was my editor after that
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dot CA is canada.com is America for

Listen this is a I see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some customer service that has
that is not Getting done because Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: River extracts CA gets a lot of calls a
lot of emails and a lot of people in my
[SPEAKER_00]: social media Asking me about Blue River
extracts us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Blue River extracts us has made it
pretty clear But you guys might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put a phone number up if you're still
watching Michael So people can contact you
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask you these questions because you
might not see it But what they're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: they're asking me these questions And I
can promise you it's taking up light time
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life I get a lot of phone calls
actually from from my website about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't know just figure it out
guys Very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only bit in only business to
business now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it I mean if that's it,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as that still I would put
it before phone number with someone just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that or even an answering machine
because people look they can't Get it from
[SPEAKER_00]: just that they look at the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what do you mean not selling
anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean they're not selling they
want to ask the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know for me for my company I
would have Like a phone number up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: recording if I didn't want to answer it so
people could also hear it We're no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: selling, you know person to person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only doing business to business so
Any tips on pressing the eater out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: puck of hash before I sieve it the eater
Would that be the moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my views on psychedelics well,
I like them a lot I think they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's nice that people can go
inward instead of outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Guess it's a business as someone that
would be purchasing wholesale probably but
[SPEAKER_00]: once Again, if they had a phone number,
these are things that although they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can email them info at and
Ask them that very question or you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: could just continue to hit me up on my
social media while we're doing a wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: bake I guess it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's what depends on what you want
to hear most of How much would you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically process in a one gallon versus a
five gallon bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well 56 grams is the maximum dry that I
would put in a one gallon 200 grams dry is
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum I put in a five gallon 56 dry
is close to 200 grams wet and 200 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry is around a thousand grams wet,
but I like to do it around 800 fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen 800 grams into a five gallon bucket
200 grams fresh frozen into a one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket So it's pretty simple about four
times the the weight of dry will be fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you tip at a restaurant in Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes chase 20% always and every time
servers work hard in life The service is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely horrible and the food is shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even then I still have a hard time not
doing it Yep Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right melty heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your fave dabbler at the moment my
fave dabbler?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what that even means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going from Korea?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between the effects
of low temp dabs and a vape like a
[SPEAKER_00]: volcano?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just very different ones like
light one's very light You know like a one
[SPEAKER_00]: course and one's very heavy like a seven
course Does fresh frozen get dry at all
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's in the freezer it can it can
especially if it's allowed like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know The freezer sometimes can act as
a desiccant and pull moisture out of
[SPEAKER_00]: things Nate sizzle good name good name
Sticks that would be up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're certainly not illegal at the
border, but I just sell them here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada I'm not Have you seen that guy Alex
free climb El Cap Mountain in four hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw Alex Honnold free Climb El
Cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unbelievable pretty insane Really
insane actually it's kind of like wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, no safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No nothing just going for it It's like I'm
glad people like that Exists though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's insane Inspirational really
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean who doesn't watch that and think
I'm a human I should be able to do human
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm pretty sure that's not human
shit Even if you've ever looked at his
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers, they're just like these huge
sausages I think they can probably hold an
[SPEAKER_00]: insane amount of weight compared to most
people's fingers No, we're still far away
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still far away from legalizing
cannabis axle monster Hey, what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cootin a?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on Nicola gamer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think puff Wednesdays are done for
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean for now, you know,
maybe let's I were not it's not like we've
[SPEAKER_00]: retired it forever It's just not happening
if it's just started happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if John's got his life on track
right now He's super busy his business is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved in together Plus he's got all
his channel and all the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know kind of Stuff that he's
constantly doing that's new and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: myself am at least That busy and more
because I have three children,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the two of us We got so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I first met John he had the
most time out of anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was retired He just he got his pension
from getting hurt and he didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything He had literally seven days a
week to do whatever he wanted to do And so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when he started hanging out with me
four or five days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would come we would film all the time
He just had nothing else to do but since
[SPEAKER_00]: we've started Doing that filming he has
become an incredibly busy gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good for him is right fucking a I'm not
too sure No, I do not suggest dry ice dry
[SPEAKER_00]: ice is the worst thing you could do stay
away from dry ice dry ice is not your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend It's going to make it look like you
get a lot, but that lot that you get is
[SPEAKER_00]: less head and more contaminant It's
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's convincing you one thing while the
reality is saying enough and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make cleaning that material even harder
when you try to get out just the heads and
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you just press it it still ends up
getting this weird funky darkness to it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Contaminant that you're pressing
along with the heads I'm not a huge fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: live resin myself I think that I've always
appreciated bud that was properly cured
[SPEAKER_00]: and that bud that's properly cured is not
just the plant matter releasing moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the resin glands releasing
Extremely caustic terpenes that evaporate
[SPEAKER_00]: and volatize first prior to any of the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that are We are burping
out of the weed in the curing process and
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them to be out of my hash as well
so I prefer a nice strong hash that's
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth on the throat, but still gonna grab
me by the nuts and Yeah, that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I like Good luck with your event
Korean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't hear about what happened The
Korean dude was talking about but yes,

tanks tanks THC exams blowing hash clouds

two tears down.

Full-screen hash rig.

looking for hash tools Dude how about I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still waiting for Scaldone and Indra to

[SPEAKER_00]: since those guys said they were gonna test
those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a test that I wanted to see

if you want to be a real youtuber you need
[SPEAKER_00]: drone footage, that's funny Well,
I've got drone footage I haven't pulled my
[SPEAKER_00]: drone out for a while because I didn't
feel like people wanted to see the same
[SPEAKER_00]: old drone footage over and over again
Which is really you know what a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: drone footage would be at this point You
really need to take a trip and go driving
[SPEAKER_00]: and spend a day with a bunch of different
batteries and chargers so you could go out
[SPEAKER_00]: and You know get some really epic drone
footage some b-roll if you will that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could take later and Cut into your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself am an idiot and I just do it all
the same day I get all the footage that
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the editing that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I film everything It's it's completely
insane and it becomes difficult as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see these live videos are much easier the
filmed edited videos are much harder I
[SPEAKER_00]: Think some of it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bud Cushman or you could become a
business and buy wholesale Fill a niche
