[SPEAKER_04]: I was just gonna say there's skunk man's
here as well if you guys wanna hear a
[SPEAKER_04]: quick intro from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people know a lot about
him, but it might be a neat thing to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple of words from the man himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here he is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, howdy, howdy everybody in Hatch
Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my experience with greenhouses was I
built my own greenhouse about 40 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I moved to the Netherlands where
I ran many, many, many professional
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses with computerized darkening,
computerized watering and my favorite way
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow is greenhouses although there's
but I've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen most of the changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were one of the very first in the world
to use darkening to mature cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers when we were in the northern
environment in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody has any questions,
I'll be happy to step up to the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: But except for that, I am what I am and I
think pretty much everybody knows me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Sam, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We bring it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe skunk man Sam, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be interested to hear about your
progression of greenhouse growing and some
[SPEAKER_06]: of your maybe your life deprivation
experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing in greenhouses ever
since the first year I grew cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in maybe 72 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just a homemade primitive
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And friends of mine were doing darkening
for sexing, not for flowering,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for sexing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them what we just talked about about
the sexing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the problems with the sexing
was at that time they didn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would darken it for two weeks
until the plant showed sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the research that I found when we
were doing the research in Holland was
[SPEAKER_02]: that most indica varieties you can darken
for one day and then two weeks later they
[SPEAKER_02]: will show sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will not stay flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with veg, with sativa varieties,
sometimes they need to be darkened two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three days at the very most.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then two weeks later they show the
sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had a friend who produced
thousands and thousands of seedlings and
[SPEAKER_02]: then darkened them off just for sexing to
sell early known female plants to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few times, because he darkened them
for two weeks, they would not come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the customers were rather irate that
they had these little plants that were two
[SPEAKER_02]: feet tall and flowered off and they would
not return veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you also tell the story of how you
discovered greenhouse light depth in
[SPEAKER_04]: Holland?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, greenhouse light depth, what
happened was I went into a chrysanthemum
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse because I was interested in
building my own greenhouse or buying one
[SPEAKER_02]: or renting one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I saw the chrysanthemums were being
darkened to induce flowering and a light
[SPEAKER_02]: went on in my head and I went,
Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had seen people darken plants
with a tarp in the late 70s and early 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wasn't interested because I wanted a
greenhouse that was multiple acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't hand darken multiple acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually you can if you have enough
labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so once I saw what darkening
could do, I instantly understood what this
[SPEAKER_02]: was for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was, I don't know,
maybe 86 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I saw that, yeah, I never stepped
back for the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need darkening because you can you can
grow multiple crops a year or you can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: one big good heavy crop and darken it and
get it out before the cold comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your heating bills are ten thousand
dollars a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you also comment, Sam,
on earlier Mika was talking, Micah was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking and he mentioned how he kind of
likes to keep them a little bit smaller,
[SPEAKER_04]: which might be perfect for what he's doing
and producing super high quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you came in as a sort of like,
oh, I'd like to have really big greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe just talk to why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the main reason is I like big
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the work I'm doing is not
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for breeding work, I start seeds,
thousands and thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I do is I want to pick the
best plants and to pick the best plant
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult to do with a little
one or two foot plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it 12 feet tall, you get a really
good idea of its positive and negative
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for for a breeder, it's it's really
required.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I had a very high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ceiling was maybe 20 feet or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could grow 15 foot tall plants if I
want, get three, four or five kilos of
[SPEAKER_02]: dried material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you, Sam, about the sexing one
more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for people that are,
you know, maybe don't have a lot of power
[SPEAKER_01]: still in Humboldt or, you know,
these craft farmers, if they were to sex
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants, like you were saying,
how long if it was it's depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, you would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody was to do it, would you
say to darken it for a day or two instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two weeks like your friend did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I experienced the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen plants that didn't come back out
of the veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you talk a little bit more about
that, like your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is my mic on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing is that cannabis will take
two weeks to express its sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one or two days of darkening is enough
to trip the expression two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main thing you have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: With earlier varieties, only one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a very late, late equatorial
variety, maybe it takes two or three days
[SPEAKER_02]: at the very most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you put them back on a long
cycle, two weeks later, they sex,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't stay flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are totally veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you grow them really, really big and
then flower them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what sex they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost like at the end of that,
you should also say you're welcome,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that was a gem right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, dude, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely a game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for dropping that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, can we can't we quantify things with
lab tests sometimes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that I've talked to a few
lab companies that have said over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of time, some of the greenhouse
material they've been testing has tested
[SPEAKER_01]: higher in the THC, CBD, and even the
terpene percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the terpene companies,
Bubble Man, maybe you might know something
[SPEAKER_01]: about that with greenhouse material and
the terpene production that you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: heard about or known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I unmuted?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From, you know, right from Tony's mouth,
almost always the lights at the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to produce like a way higher
level of terpene production, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just a smaller amount, but like a
substantially larger amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to change the subject completely,
but while I have the mic, one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things Sam was mentioning about greenhouse
triggering flowering as well, particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: in, I guess it was in like close to the
equator countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they have 12 hours and 12 hours of
light and darkness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And often people are trying to grow with
added lights, additional light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll maybe put it on for another five
or six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam had an interesting bit of information
to share on tropical cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, what we found is that in the
Netherlands, when I would grow big giant
[SPEAKER_02]: plants at 10, 12 feet tall over the
winter, I could give as little as I was
[SPEAKER_02]: using these little 60 watt blue
incandescent agricultural balls from
[SPEAKER_02]: Phillips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were geared towards,
but they were only 60 watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would use one of those for every 10
square meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 100 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it absolutely prevented flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but you could use as little
as just, instead of giving them six or
[SPEAKER_02]: eight hours of light to keep them veg,
what you could do is just in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the night, give them two hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one for people that have
been, especially in countries where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he was mentioning like only
having one generator, only being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: turn on enough light in one section of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do a quarter here, a quarter
there, a quarter there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of leaving it on, I'll tell
you how severe I've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was storing plants under
refrigeration at about plus three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're in a refrigerator with lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And alls I gave them was 15 minutes of
light four times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every five hours, I'd give them or five
or six hours, I give them 15 minutes of
[SPEAKER_02]: light, totally prevented flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stayed veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also weren't, they weren't growing
because it was so cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alls I was trying to do was keep the
plants alive as a library.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that there was any reduction
in actual growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: No growth practically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean under three degrees, there's
practically zero growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to maintain them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my, I guess my question is,
is, you know, I think some people would
[SPEAKER_03]: argue, well, they keep all these lights on
because not only do they want to,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the photo period going, but they're
also trying to have the plant grow at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just curious if you saw any
difference at any point in your,
[SPEAKER_03]: in your experiences where there,
you could see like a difference in growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: growth rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more lumens and the more hours,
of course you're going to get more growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that wasn't my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal was to, I had big plants in the
ground, which I conserved in my
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a small collection on, on ebb and
flow tables under, under halides and just
[SPEAKER_02]: as a library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a third collection in,
I had specially made like a refrigerator
[SPEAKER_02]: with lights built into it, which and those
I gave them as little as an hour a day
[SPEAKER_02]: broken up in 15 minutes so that they never
received really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long periods of dark at any one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just met a guy in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my research comes from old,
old school growers in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said the same thing Sam was
saying as far as keeping the plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy came here recently and did a
greenhouse tour and he goes, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have my light on in the middle of
the night for one hour in the winter time
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, to save on generator and
power and all these things that people
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with, they can't use all this
electricity or access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the middle of the night,
you know, so when he told me that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: veg period, he, that he only uses the
light for one hour in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night, I was just like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm starting to hear a little bit,
some pieces of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course now Sam is kind of
confirming that whole thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I'm going to try it,
you know, like I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing sexing stuff and play around
with all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another thing to remind yourself is,
is lots of lumens, less time, like an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour, but less lumens, maybe two hours to
prevent flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind as your sort of
recipe as you get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just, I just want to make sure I'm
hearing you right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thought process is don't,
don't give them a long period of no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying just break it up and you're,
you're turning the light on for 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: every hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Sam was saying that for his
library and part of his experimentation
[SPEAKER_01]: was to keep these plants from growing,
but to keep the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he said he dosed them in a couple
of times, 15 minutes at a time,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I heard you right, Sam, and then a two
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he were just confirming was the
two hours for a low lumen light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had higher lumens, you could use
maybe less time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thing you wanted to share about talking
about lumens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what we've found is that
absolutely need lots of lumens to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass and vegetation is flowered halfway
or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much also it's going to do then
is fill out the flowers and maybe add a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of weight from resin and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found lower light levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about from the sun or from
artificial lights actually produce
[SPEAKER_02]: superior product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what I found is that the high
temperatures associated with flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: really high temperatures, it's not really
positive because it has a tendency to
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporize terpenes right on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lower temperatures, little bit lower
lumens, I found produce superior product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here when we were on mute that,
well, do you want to mention it,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about the size of the resin blends
versus the size of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just wanted to mention that when I
grew the identical clone, big,
[SPEAKER_02]: small, even in vitro so that the flowered
off plant was only maybe an inch or two
[SPEAKER_02]: tall when it was completely flowered in
agar agar, in vitro, in a test tube,
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin individual resin heads on that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grow it two, three feet tall,
like you're talking about for sea green or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, the resin is quite a bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I grew my same clone and it was
12 feet tall, the resin was again a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We missed that last that last little part,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the last little part was that if
your plant is 12 feet tall and you
[SPEAKER_02]: flowered off and then you collect the
resin from that, it's again a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger than the three foot plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each individual resin head is a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for hash makers, that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit.
