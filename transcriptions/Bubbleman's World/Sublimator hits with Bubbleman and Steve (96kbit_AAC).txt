[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble Man here, sitting in beautiful
British Columbia with a good friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine, Steve Thackeray, an actor of
extraordinary ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to sublimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like a fabulous plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we've got the sublimator plugged into
the Swiss Perk, so I'm no longer hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual plastic sublimator bong,
which I have to say I've hit on many
[SPEAKER_01]: occasions, but I'm happy to move into
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite as hot as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go for a full sublimator,
and this is going to be hot enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, this is my friend's report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me help you with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smuggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is how a sublimator should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing it right, it'll pretty
much hit like that every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be back in a little bit.
See you next time.
