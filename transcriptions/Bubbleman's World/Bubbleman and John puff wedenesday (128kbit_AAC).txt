[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just heard John B pulling up the driveway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought we'd catch him before he got up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, backing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's backing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: John B in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's brought goods.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting used to this now,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get used to this for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple of fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pro mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's start pulling this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop that right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pots.
Pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compliments, of course, Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Dan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan from P&W took this off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a good idea to lay the tarp down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude coming up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He and Jack moved on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tarp goes back up all the way to
West Ham Street on the bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks for dinner, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the accident, but still,
thanks for the dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like it was anybody who was
hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was like 10 cars that were all piled
up or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you bring the blade down yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I brought one down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Show what I do, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always just do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slice her in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little less than a third.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just break her off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: For small growers, we always have this
little technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the hat back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the hat back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put one full bag of cocoa and always do
one half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the half.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to pass me that razor
blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take out the tarp, mind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a baby bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all said we had to break apart so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: This already comes free.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 300 parts, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone will correct me on that,
of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Internet's horror, we certainly
don't claim to know everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just learning ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we'll get this all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminds me of back in the day,
getting soil ready for outdoor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at all the castings and build up
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge mountains of it on tarps.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be totally cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, I've been doing it in bins for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: No mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: No tarps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this was in the Kootenays 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just shows that the dedication.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were showing me how I was really on
their sort of, just happy to be there
[SPEAKER_04]: learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I always do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I've been doing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to show you what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier today, I asked John, I said to
John, maybe if you get me a bag of
[SPEAKER_03]: castings, it's just the old school organic
farmer in me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, you know, there's tons of it
in the Medi One, so I don't really put
[SPEAKER_03]: them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, don't even bother grabbing the
castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi One has so far produced immaculate
resin from the pictures, to the smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the visual, just with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has said I'm doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you've grown kaleweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really takes the pride of my French the
fuck out of growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just little things, mixing the soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I always say, I use Pro-Mix and some
cocoa, and that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to... Well, why don't we go
and get those plants from upstairs and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring them down here for transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound like a plan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a perfect plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just adding a little bit of moisture
to this soil-less, about three,
[SPEAKER_03]: four liters of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big tub.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already pretty much, you know,
heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to make it any more heavy
for me to be moving around by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've just been adding a little bit
of H2O.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to be adding a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just make your thing so heavy,
and I mean, you can always water the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: when the plants are in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just to give it a bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give you a little picture
there, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not working too well for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it looks nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this Pro-Mix chair I have going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm rocking the cocoa fiber chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do the low-rider thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reach over and grab some pots,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got some sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a couple of pots here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got on that side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got some sweet skunks that we
should probably start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones I'm most anxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get going.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are going to be mothers,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this perfect clone right here,
and right here, and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, uh, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are going to be some exciting times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, John and I don't keep strains
from one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: John doesn't tell me about his awesome
strains and then tell me I can't have
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, because of how helpful John
was since the beginning of helping me get
[SPEAKER_03]: my license and helping me on every level
with planting and cloning and the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: nine yards, of course John always has
access to everything I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, uh, there's no other way about
it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same goes on my end.
Expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even props.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, uh, we love this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You do that one, and I'll do this one
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, when I open these up, I just kind
of give it a little squish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That works out nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull off gently.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this one here, we do have a few
roots, but we can actually pull those
[SPEAKER_04]: right through nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to get this little hole opened
up so these roots can make their way
[SPEAKER_03]: through.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm looking for right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just having the nightmare from hell
with this root mass, but I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but that's why you have them in and
you did an awesome job of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go the other way though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flip the root right down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you know, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at some nice trays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at these just came in handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But did these come from the airport by any
chance, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the two extra little ones
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for some today and I was
like, come on, we didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just happy that's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get him a little straighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get him a little straighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes just how you put a
plant in a pot really will affect the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of its growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it's very simple to train
that plant back to where you want it to
[SPEAKER_03]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just personal choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to have my plants, uh, you know,
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go Barbara and you're going
to go Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going up too big on size from
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: About a gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to mostly it'll be a base.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can put that right down on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be about perfect right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're back after the dog experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do the transplanting of the
Barb and the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we'll both, we've already put a
tiny little bit of, uh, soil in the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say I have maybe four or five inches
tops mainly because two inches of this pot
[SPEAKER_03]: is, um, actually not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can reuse this sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would sure be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants are definitely a little
moist, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it won't be water right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't really want to transplant
super dry plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dirt could start falling apart and
it's just, I find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit easier to have a bit of
moisture in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not super wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not super wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got watered a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see how you water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You water very lightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I water lightly and often, like not super
often, but you know, I like to let them,
[SPEAKER_03]: I find if you just water them too much,
they, um, they have a hard time drying out
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there we go with the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you notice when I did that,
I put the sticker on the bucket before I
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I put the plant down,
I put the peg in the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing you'll never hear from me is not
knowing what strain I'm growing or what
[SPEAKER_03]: strain I have, because I'm obsessive with
the names and the labeling of the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I know that it's, it would be easy
for me to put this down and even mix these
[SPEAKER_03]: two plants up in an instant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I do all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got those, you got your sticker on
that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you also put the peg in there or
did that get lost?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think, I think it actually got lost
and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took mine out and put it aside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I put it somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you when you dumped the plant,
it might've gone in the dirt, but I
[SPEAKER_03]: apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find it or we'll use a new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it's Afghani from the sticker on
the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Label your plants multiple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Label your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a little stick in the, in the,
in the mud, put a sticker on the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, everyone thinks they recognize
their plants and knows their plants so
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say nothing better than having a label
on your plant so that when you share it or
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else gets it, it's just easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Matt gave me both of these,
all three of these strains with labels,
[SPEAKER_03]: double labels, sticker on the pot and a
little piece stuck into the, into the,
[SPEAKER_03]: into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just cause these darn genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so easy to get them all mixed up and
people don't know what they have and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what this was and that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to keep mine down to a mere
minimal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least I got an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you always have an idea once you
bloom them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause right now my two, my Dennis and my
number four, I know they're one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, for someone like myself,
um, I, I just, I guess for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love, I know what I have and I got
an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with, well, this is
something, uh, it's going to be a new
[SPEAKER_04]: surprise because I can't remember what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what John and I are all about
sharing with you too, is that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: different people and we have different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're just telling our ways for the
people that would, um, have things in
[SPEAKER_03]: common with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's many other different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: To do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just a couple of different ways
that we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important thing I would say to
myself is damn, I should have labeled it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hence, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm like, okay, I'm going to label
my next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I already, I want to get that Afghani
label.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it definitely didn't go in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't put it in this soil either,
but, uh, it is a small little label that
[SPEAKER_03]: could be, I'll find it one day and laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right around there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be like, I've got it, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: See this is how it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to, uh, probably end
up, I guess we'll water these plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: then a little later on, we're going to
take a couple of clones off the Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Barb and, uh, nice send John home
with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once our sweet skunks get a little bit
older, I'd say maybe two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they're growing nice and we've got
them up to sort of this style,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can come take a bunch of cuts of those
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be beautiful for my
summertime one because of the sweet and
[SPEAKER_04]: the skunk and they're getting more and
more outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the little tiny leaves,
how it almost looks like a bonsai.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how it's like the, I mean,
you can just see how Matt's worked on the
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect clones here, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like right from the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how he's brushed them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be main moms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it how he's done here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, you know, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a clone with your name on it right
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it right from here, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to give it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to pass it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, it's just, I don't even feel
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice thing to be able to,
uh, actually enjoy what we love so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't send them in the mail and we
were not, you know, if, uh, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: these ones are, are here at illegal grow
and they're going to stay here at illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people are going to be saying,
Hey, can you send me that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I offer the strains to my friends
with licenses and that's, and that's who I
[SPEAKER_03]: offer it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that eventually I get these
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know Matt's got his strains so
you can buy them in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm into getting strains to breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm into, to people working with these
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to pass the sweet skunk
around to a couple of breeder friends of
[SPEAKER_03]: mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might send it to Javier at medical seeds
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Phil from true genetics up in Whistler
wants to play around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice thing to let them play around
with it and it's, it's an ideal thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people think that the gene
pool will be destroyed, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as long as we keep the originals,
they'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference in the leaf pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's just see, oh,
they're so different structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, for like, you know,
for me that I, I really take, pay
[SPEAKER_04]: attention to the serration and the leaf
pattern and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives me how to identify a lot of the
strains and how they grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am able to see the different genetics
and see how things actually, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we go mix up a batch of many one
show them how simple that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll give these guys a little
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then flush out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give some water, clean water,
non-food to the, uh, blooming garden as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took a few of the shots, macro shots of
that Medi Kush today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looked so clean and untouched.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you never touched them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just looked like perfection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just I can't wait to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The string definitely produces some nice
resin as I've seen from John's grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I've never been able to shoot it
whenever I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what the live and seeing that
live plant resin is actually like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the shots you've done with
Rhiannon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, your pictures phenomenal,
but I mean, being able to really take a
[SPEAKER_04]: look at it and then understand what we're
actually really trying to get into.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge part of our education,
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the medicine, you know, but,
but the photography, the detailed macro
[SPEAKER_03]: photography is a huge part of our
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's well for me, it's been the
next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've, you know, been playing around
with it since two months.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2008 and it's been growing and,
and each year becoming a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The teacher right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, the student right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the student.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am but a student.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am but a humble servant of John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get this guy a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll, we'll mix up the medicine and
we'll show you guys that next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now here on the deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one of my favorite zones around this
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say this, this zone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second to the hammocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the hammocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hammocks take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it is very nice relaxing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always get up when the sun's coming
down because we're always like the
[SPEAKER_04]: evenings or in the mid-afternoons because,
well, because we're doing all this all day
[SPEAKER_04]: getting ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's a little bit of
behind the scenes stuff that we have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: to get this stuff ready for you guys,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what we're going to do now is we're
going to show you a real simple feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: using Medi One.
[SPEAKER_03]: One part system.
[SPEAKER_03]: John can tell you a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's, it's what I use.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and as you can, as Mark was
saying, it's just, it's just easy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of you guys out there are your
small growers and, and really it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: like if your bottle will shake,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a one part growing bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you want to learn more about it,
of course, I'm sure you can Google it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm not going to get too much into it,
but I mean, this is, this is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a, a 15 milliliters,
one tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so killer coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, last time I grew, I was growing with
earth juice, probably 15, 16, even 17
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, the same smell that Guano wish
Kelpie just awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course I brought you some pH up and
this is probably enough to last him for
[SPEAKER_03]: about probably three years to give you a
little bit of an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water comes out of the tap here at an
eight pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just put the Medi One in.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will maybe even seven,
seven, seven point something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we just put the Medi One in to that
seven to eight pH water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brought us down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it's going to be about 3.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, right now it's at 3.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's holding around 3.4, 3.3.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I get 3.7 at my house and already
Mark is now dialing in 3.2.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, for me at this point,
I'm going to step back because he's
[SPEAKER_04]: already dialed in what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took, you know, it didn't take very
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a very simple system.
[SPEAKER_03]: John showed me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basically dialed it to put it,
the tiniest little bit of pH up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a half teaspoon here,
which is 2.5 milliliters and I won't even
[SPEAKER_03]: use that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll actually see how much you use in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how he's a, I can already see
the, the end, the end side has already got
[SPEAKER_04]: like a small measurement that he keeps
using.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like you've got it dialed in
my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what I often will,
I'd rather go slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't have any pH down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, we don't want to go over pH
down and then water down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had to do it so many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can happen, but it's such a pain in the
butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather have a, so this will probably
take you up to about five, maybe 5.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still 4.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put probably the same amount
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course we're looking for a 6.2 to a
6.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the pretty much what everybody kind
of aims for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ideal nutrient uptake pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll take a little bit more of that
out, a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably still haven't put a full one of
these in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a full one in and nail it,
but if you go over the tiniest little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, it takes forever to get up
to the right amount sometimes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one drop brings it up like four points
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, on my water, I had my water
comes out of the tap at 6.3.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_04]: My rainwater sometimes and out of the
dehu, sometimes I get 5.6, sometimes I get
[SPEAKER_04]: 6.2, but I get an average of 15 mils of
Medi-1 to one mil of pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take that 6.1, 6.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use roughly about a mil and a
bit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got our food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went 15 mLs, which for Medi-1,
week one, you can go as low as 2.5 mLs per
[SPEAKER_03]: liter, which is basically, we put in about
double that, but these plants here,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as these ones, they've been
growing for over a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can start in at the two week point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is what I've been doing for
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been using Medi-1 since 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started doing the testing on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a buddy, you know, this is how I do
things, is what works for the strings that
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that work here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody really needs to pay attention to
how some people burn their plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always just take my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feed too heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take my time, just like Mark's doing
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his whole little watering
techniques and how he wants to do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got their little techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to do it the way you want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the coolest thing, because it's
your little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you've got these four or five
plants, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to let anyone tell you
anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to ideas and concepts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to give those guys a couple of
shots?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could probably even use another
feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these ones are quite small,
with a small root mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the amount of water I gave them
will be more than enough, probably about
[SPEAKER_03]: 600 milliliters, a little bit under a
liter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And John's just doing up the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were the sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but certainly not least,
if you want to slide that over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I turn, because all the dirt was on
the side and the moisture was already
[SPEAKER_04]: there, so I was just kind of feeding the
other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it the way you like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very into feeding right down on top of
the stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you don't want to do
that all the time, or you can end up with
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit of stalk rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remo was really showing me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: With his big plants, yeah, it's not as big
of a devastator on the small plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a big plant, basically you get a
little bit of that, and it ends up locking
[SPEAKER_03]: up the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can lose an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did there is because the plant
went right in the center, and it had that
[SPEAKER_04]: little one inch wide there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, and it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots are all right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just dripped down to the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just touching those roots and taking
up the uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are going to grow beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing about watering cannabis is
you'll see, we didn't even plan this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you notice he watered it exactly the
opposite way, or I watered it exactly the
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite way of him?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were working together and trying to
grow together, that would basically divide
[SPEAKER_03]: our friendship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because growers have to do it their way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do it our way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to water in the center.
[SPEAKER_03]: John's going to water on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And jeez, I bet you there's 100 other guys
watering 100 other different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would definitely water in the center
when I'm a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the bigger plants,
so there's reasons for why I did this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have different methods.
Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the wonderful thing about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow any way you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, resin talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're producing full-mount resin,
and people are telling you that you need
[SPEAKER_03]: to change the way you're doing things,
but they themselves are not producing
[SPEAKER_03]: full-mount resin, you should avoid
listening to anything that they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to John, and I listen to his
tips, because he's producing full-mount.
[SPEAKER_03]: resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't grown in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I have to admit, I'm feeling
like I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should take him inside and take a look
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't grown it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks amazing in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, well, a small garden, easy to take
care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so come check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here's my little guys,
my little gals, I should say, all brought
[SPEAKER_03]: over by you.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long ago would you say you brought
these over?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been about a month and a half,
two months.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's been that long?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's been more about five and a
half weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've been flowering for maybe
four, four and a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're looking amazing,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you were saying, look at how well
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're definitely avoiding newt burns
on the tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's a little yellow right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting to not feed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're starting to autumn off,
and we're going to start getting some,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, definitely the watermelon is
looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Underneath here, we have the Medi Kush,
which is looking absolutely spectacular as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, just greasing right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice living resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bubba Cam right in behind there,
kind of growing up almost leafy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leafing out again, kind of stretching
those buds out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's the style of the nugget
because I've definitely been avoiding all
[SPEAKER_03]: light in this tunnel, or in this tunnel,
in this little tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got My Little Pony in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now she's way behind the rest of these
guys because she's going to flower for
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So her resin production is not really on
point just yet compared to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, but she has a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that sati leaf just climbing
up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Working great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time for us to have a puff,
and we'll get back to you guys in a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, another Puff Wednesday is complete,
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured we might as well just finish it
off with a sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the plants look and... I was just
like, look at how beautiful that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at just like, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking happy to see the new
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: No complaints.
[SPEAKER_03]: No complaints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Temperature wise here, 749.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have we got over there in the balls
today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we got some watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit of watermelon from Mr.
Ron.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some nice 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is well cured now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been curing up since December.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean, puffing on,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that little bit that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit, 7 grams actually,
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, here, just take a little bit
home.
[SPEAKER_04]: He pours a bunch in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be puffing on this for a couple of
weeks, but it's almost done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Load it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hit the 90 micron that Ron
has all nicely cured up for a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: months, and then we're going to hit the 90
micron that we made on your birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's both watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, this one is so spicy and
hashy because of the long cure and he
[SPEAKER_03]: almost even overdried it by leaving it out
for so, so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a killer hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's way too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are friends for?
[SPEAKER_03]: By pushing it up against the wall,
smudging it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what friends are for right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this watermelon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice little way to clean the dab
up right off the edge of the table like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what, like always,
we've got something always new happening
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always something new happening on
Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are the big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your comments and your views, people just
paying attention to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes us feel like, holy shit,
people like this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make more videos and we come up with
more ideas and we're definitely down with
[SPEAKER_03]: your comment ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have ideas of things you want to
see me and John doing that are within
[SPEAKER_03]: reason, we're not really the crazy types
to just do a video about anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you like to learn?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's cannabis related, if it's
something you want to learn about,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's something that you think we might
know about or might want to learn about,
[SPEAKER_03]: throw a comment in and let us know what
your ideas are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be, you know, we're going
to need someone to actually structure
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be all these comments
coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.
Here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's yours next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to say boom boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, boom, shaboom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Herrera next.
[SPEAKER_04]: This came from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as he's hitting the toke,
I'm going to say boom rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a really long day as always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad you made it by again,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: These ladies needed some bigger pots and
grabbed a few supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work mission Monday, so that's what I
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan hooked me up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Monday today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow is Tuesday and we're going to be
filming the second part of Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to start filming these Puff
Wednesdays early because I'm not putting
[SPEAKER_03]: them up until Saturday or Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to actually do the starting
of Puff Wednesday and Tuesday and finish
[SPEAKER_04]: off on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, this will be the first part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first part of you coming by
and doing the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then tomorrow we're going to go out to
Surrey to my buddy's warehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a wholesale or distribution,
distribution hydroponics company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll be looking at picking up an
eight by four tent with some lights and
[SPEAKER_03]: bulbs and all the little bells and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistles that we'll need for the unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, from there, we're basically
going to boot back here to the garage and
[SPEAKER_03]: set that tent up, get these plants into
the top tent and get my blooming plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that are currently in a very small four,
a two by or four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, so small.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get them into that eight by four.
[SPEAKER_03]: How happy are they going to be under sick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I could put three six
hundreds in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, um, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm turning the whole thing into hash like
I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a four weeks or so, um,
I'll be turning the four watermelons,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Medi Kush and the chem four reunion
into hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure how I'm going to do it
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might keep one watermelon for sift and
three for bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it's hard because what I did,
I did half.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went four.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have one in the freezer at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my little pony in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a Medi Kush in your freezer
from, yes, that's still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second run, we were getting backed
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just so backed up, but, um,
we're just not running out of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not needed right now, but I'm sure
when the time gets close, we'll definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: be washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, bud.
One thing
[SPEAKER_03]: about the D Nail is it really sort of
trains you to hit a bomb differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hit it like a beeline, you'll,
there's a lot of the hit that's still
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it's taking me a while to train
myself to do this long, slow sort of haul.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you saw, I was trying to do small
ones, but Mark always here like that hit
[SPEAKER_04]: me hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go big.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you go for the 90 fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well kill me John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got your own thing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's a little warm though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just cool it down right on the on the
stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sift is not a friend, nor is the full
melt bubble to a warm metal skillet tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: See some clones on here with your name on
them, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe seeing those grow in my garden too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
Ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of started bubbling on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it dissipated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is the 90.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it hits almost sift like there's no
one on God's green earth that could deny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: The turp factor on that resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you if we had the same,
well, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make sift from my watermelon in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hang it for like 14 to 21 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Break it up gently over the screens and
then the other two plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll break up two large screens and I'll
do two into the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually what's funny is I just cut
down my last four watermelon and my three
[SPEAKER_04]: Medi Kush's last night and they're hanging
because the ones I did previously two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks prior I just took them extra long
like day 105.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to dry sift those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, do you want to cut a couple of clones
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to take a couple of these
barbs in Afghani's home today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's grab one of each for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I managed to grab the two that John gave
me the other day with, I guess he gave me
[SPEAKER_03]: three actually, but I gave one away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who did I give that to?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember who I gave it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only had three, but I gave one away
because of course that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give one away or two if you have
three, as long as you got one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now these two that John gave me
just the other day that were full of
[SPEAKER_03]: watermelons, I guess now are going to
become an Afghani and a barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to put an A on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A.
[SPEAKER_03]: A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coincidentally, we're going to put a B
on the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A and B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have thought it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the next one we should cut is the
canatonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: C.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then D, digweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all man's.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what the best thing about this
is, is once I get these all nice and
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy is I'm going to cut an A and a B
and I'm going to give it to somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to get, you want to go pretty
small here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's something like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice little clone, hey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the major, uh, just go over at an
angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll still leave a growth site.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pull this guy off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him a tiny little bit more.
Perfecto.
[SPEAKER_03]: One little, one little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now a barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find yourself a nice barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take any one you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I had seen one on the Afghani,
truly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just was standing there saying,
I'm taking me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at this one right inside of
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: See this inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it would actually wouldn't work too
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: See this one here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show the, on the inside here,
on the inside here, you see this one's
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the ones I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one here is going to cause a problem
in a sense in the future, but we'll make
[SPEAKER_04]: an amazing clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I was doing before, what I showed
you on my channel's members, it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: okay if I peel, would you like me to just
cut right below?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty big branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely don't want to leave too
big of an exposure there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm looking here, yeah,
leave maybe one growth size.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can leave these two growth sites and I'm
going to cut nice big, long stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big, long stem straight across.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to cut it on a 45.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's your B.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's my B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbara and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't have done this without you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the beginning of this circle and
we're going to follow this around and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to see how far it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give them a number four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you will give them a number four.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all, this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start sharing strains,
that's the energy that you start falling
[SPEAKER_03]: into this energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the cat's chasing the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having some fun today,
but.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You having fun, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You chasing the cat?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best thing about life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave the cat alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave the cat alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took a couple of clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the mosquito on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, is he a big mosquito?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a shot right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had my macro lens because.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you move too close to that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, he's not moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should run and get my macro lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge monster mosquito just sitting
on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's going to sit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's going to sit there.
Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's head up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we should.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've taken a clone and each.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Barb, don't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Barb somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put Barb in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hit some Barb and some
Afghani now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Barb right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani, we have to go hunt down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hit the Barb because we
just cut her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a must.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it you up or me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the size of that, so I'm going to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never pull a dab you wouldn't take for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best part about Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I'm going to use my feeding
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use Maddie one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I use massive sometimes
depending on how I feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm definitely going to grow her my
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be smoking her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to say about four months
because I like to do my little way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to hang.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a 60-day strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to know exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll take it how long I feel it's
ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where I like to stretch things and
take things to their level.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting since I
started growing again after 20 years is
[SPEAKER_03]: that I like the idea of a generalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so far, like Matt gave me these
strains, I didn't even ask how long you
[SPEAKER_03]: would flower them for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll flower them for as long as I want to
flower them for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll watch them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll photograph them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll decide when they're ready to be
cut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to let anyone tell you when
the best day to cut a strain down is
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's really giving up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've already maybe potentially given up
the person choosing a selection or a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already given up so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to grow the work that people
have done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm definitely not giving that last
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do things different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we did in the last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cut all my bottoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made some beautiful, beautiful fucking
fresh frozen with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've let it go for another couple more
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm going to take those tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm going to do too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you said this, I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just went and did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, those resin glands have
access to the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't fruited out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't care how much bigger the buds
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what we're trying to attempt to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to sugar out the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to mature the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want that resin to be just melty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, melty and awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely has to melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go find the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've hit the barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hit the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two, we just cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at how that is in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had the barb?
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have the barb?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, you hit the Afghani first.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm slightly baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that also just melts away to nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've hit the barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hit the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, Afghani for me, and then barb for
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to keep our game on point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's not too easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have done a lot,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I helped myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I helped myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might get too out of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just being stoners.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm looking at the strings and
how they affect us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one here is definitely what we
need for nighttime.
[SPEAKER_04]: This just hit me right away, nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's barb and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, we're going to set up the 4x8
tent and go to Surrey and check out the
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you tomorrow, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you in Surrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where will we start?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start at, like, that's barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see you guys tomorrow in Surrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you there, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
