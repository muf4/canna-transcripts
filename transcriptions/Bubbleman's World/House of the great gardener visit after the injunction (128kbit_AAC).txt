[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here and I'm back at
the house of the great gardener and man
[SPEAKER_00]: what a beautiful time to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just chopped down, well not just
chopped down, about three weeks ago he cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down this barb bud that we have
de-stocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a big tub of it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last one that we're gonna run
through and we've been basically dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting it with some new screens that I'm
selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These large five foot by three foot
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breaking the bud up over them
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under that is a secondary screen
that we capture the resin on top of and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a small amount of the resin is making
its way below the secondary screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a new method I've been teaching
on my YouTube channel and I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a little teaser that we're
filming a show here at the great
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener's house and it's gonna be well
worth watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more bud to break up and more dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
