[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here with tip four in the
installment of water extraction tips I've
[SPEAKER_00]: covered a few different things from ice to
curing and drying processes, but today I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to Address a question that I get a
hundred or so times a day And it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: infamous is The bubble dabble is it dabble
is your bubble dabble does it dabble?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this question over and over and over
again, so I wanted to answer it for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab ability of a water hash or a dry
sift is really dependent upon the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of that resin now a dry sifter and a wet
washer what we do as hash makers we
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate the glandular trichome head and we
do that by various means water and ice
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction which is the easy no-brainer
way and of course We also do dry sifting
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, so When we isolate the gland head
to a 99% pure gland head you get what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call purity now purity will not give you a
dabble product, but purity plus quality
[SPEAKER_00]: will and Unfortunately the quality of hash
is never decided by the hash maker unless
[SPEAKER_00]: of course he is also the grower So it's
really the grower and the genetics of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain that are going to decide the
quality how well was the resin grown was
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: To mature the resin head out and the wax
membrane to be very thin upon harvest Or
[SPEAKER_00]: was the grower focused on vegetative
yields and flowering periods these
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition based Mindsets that how much
can I get and how fast can I get it are
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental to the cannabinoid profile and
the hash maker?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is your product dabble well if your
product is a five-year Cured master kush
[SPEAKER_00]: then absolutely it is dabble this stuff's
been curing I had it in a freezer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two and a half years to preserve
terpenes but for two and a half years I
[SPEAKER_00]: had it out in a various of ways and I
basically cured it up to a real nice
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible flavor and taste and Yeah,
I'm gonna take a little dab with you right
[SPEAKER_00]: now Just to see is it dabble the question
I get all the time so we'll put a little
[SPEAKER_00]: marlin asher on in the back We'll get the
