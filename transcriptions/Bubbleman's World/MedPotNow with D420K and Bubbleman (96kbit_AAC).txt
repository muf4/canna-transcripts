[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with D420K in the house and we're
about to come check out this new dispenser
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about called Med-Pot Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you were telling me about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did, how did you meet these guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was at a dinner the other
night and I bumped into a few of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one of the young guys that moved
here from Ireland named Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's a big fan of both the channels and I
thought it would be a good place for us to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe go get ourselves a membership at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to try out new strains,
new products like the cooking edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard there was an award or something
like that for the top strains out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the compassion clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lyft has this new, this is a new
company called Lyft and they're doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis awards in Canada and basically
this particular place got number one for
[SPEAKER_02]: best dispensary and that's one of the
major reasons that I'm dropping in right
[SPEAKER_02]: now with D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, take my license, get a membership
and have some strong, good medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking medicate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also see, you know, what you think of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what, you know, is it the best
dispensary in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to go and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see what we, what we can
find and why don't you guys come with us
[SPEAKER_02]: now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best strains out of all the
compassion clubs, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm really excited just to see,
just to try because I don't smoke much but
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I guess not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Mr. D.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will, I will try it out because I
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here we are here, 4170 Frazier
Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cameraman can show us the wall here
and we've got Medpot now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical uses of cannabis and they've got a
whole list of things that if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: suffering from, you can, you can
potentially get alleviation and maybe even
[SPEAKER_02]: complete remission of these particular
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, how are you today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard you guys were number one on the
Lyft awards for dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my license here, my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show them your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just need your driver's license if
you have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always in the fourth pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always in the fourth, fifth pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I go all the way there and not get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect, you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'll photocopy this and put this
into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll check you in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, while I'm doing all of
that, you guys can go in the back and
[SPEAKER_03]: consult with your buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she says me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the guy you were talking about,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grab there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you all doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our foot pending area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the foot menu just behind you
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep around 20 to 25 strains at
a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to 25?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, keep a good quality on them and stay
around that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a good variety of edibles and
baked goods and caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely got lots of edibles,
different ones for people to take,
[SPEAKER_01]: some with lots of, some with low sugar
ones, if people may have dietary
[SPEAKER_01]: confinements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have all the concentrate on
the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatters, butters, and others,
which I'm guessing are the sifts and the
[SPEAKER_02]: water hashes.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockstar, Green Crack, Skywalker OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some organic ones that just I've
found there from Coleson Organics up in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a sniff of some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to check them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off with, this is one of the OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Shabby Toff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice looking button right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the organic hand dry and then dry
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of care with this work and
it goes an extra couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I guess, have some good things
implemented for sort of standardization to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that there's no mildews or bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep a high standard for our
medical patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with their health, they have to have
a good product that's clean, that's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's have a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got four phenols of the fighting
building here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number four, tree, two,
and one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got number one and two are the
Mekrangs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a 64, the Indica, and a 64,
the Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the phenol tree in four, we have a more
blueberry one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the tree there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a cross between duvary and
Burmese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, this is... Wow, well cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: This smells very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's got that Burmese in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that very almost exotic smell,
spicy, exotic spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy some of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something about a diesel,
a diesel cross or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is always exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come with D420K and check.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a kid in a candy store at these
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even showed him the candy yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a normal straight 70% sativa side
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice bullet structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a great one for the daytime,
very uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, this is a very nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, back into this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing the camera, showing the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy, this is a really nice one at the
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a screen crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 70% Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice strength too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a strong body effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right off the bat, you got that pine cone
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't smelt it yet, but let's see if I
can pick up the god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it definitely has that strangeness to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: God is so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you get god in there, it's just
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the god bud and the god bud
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about your Rockstar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an organic Rockstar at the
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a strong body effect,
but definitely got a bit of cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: activity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of keeps you active and thinking
about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out a couple of other bullets here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one of the great things working in
a place like this would be what better way
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn the ability of the strain than to
bioassay it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than to try it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally would feel more comfortable
purchasing something off of a bud tender
[SPEAKER_02]: that had actually used the strain than one
that was telling me what the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what the effects were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also appreciate the fact that you're a
hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think every bud tender should at least
have to go through hash education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And learn about the resin before trying to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially water extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very clean way for people to get
their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may have elements such as lung
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't smell it on the first one,
but that one I popped and was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's a different phenyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like that phenyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the more bluey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the super blueberry phenyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: The super blueberry phenyl right there for
the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it focusing nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Jake on the camera for you guys at
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen him from PG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took me out for a rip there on the
snowmobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is there a strain in here that
everybody wants?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular, the most dominant strain
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your best strain in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys would definitely be the top
contenders at the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, some very popular ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, look at that diamond at the
minute, which has a really nice look to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a very kind of a purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a blue to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue hue.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple hue for the camera there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite a nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very heavy and very body orientated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great for sleep, great for pain,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that has a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's earthy, earthy herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of herb that you could
literally grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow herb like that hydroponically
and tell people you grew it organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenes are so earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best part about this is that Dee's
getting a bunch of these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to try them all out?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to the days where there's
more melts and dry sifts on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke much, but you know that
because after you're on the dry sift and
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash and you've got that product,
you're available to it, it's not very
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at this as a jar of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at this as one of my nug jars full
of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a blue hue to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of us would die to just grab this
whole thing and then crush it over
[SPEAKER_02]: screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go do that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost did it the last place we were
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do like to do though the most is
introduce this to other people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and stuff to say, look,
this is what's available down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come down, you can get signed up,
bring your license down because some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are getting the stuff mailed to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolute garbage from some of
these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant is being put into a wood
shredder and then it's sold in pill
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles that's sent to the mail from these
government grown places and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite different from being offered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this lets people know that there is
way better things out there than the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you guys have really beautiful
looking pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm inclined to ask to see a few more just
for the audience because so far I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: seen anything that I haven't been
impressed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a great structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a water melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great kind of day timer and it's a
50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can give you a relaxed feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is water melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of turps in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hash that I make often.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the colors and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some Astro Boy that's been well
cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see this at my house ever
because I take it fresh frozen right off
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks real, real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Velvety even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a unique look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so coated in resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows that way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that was a nice surprise to have a
big jar of the water melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an Ampere Ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very heavy resin on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very strong effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something like a very heavy... You
can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite sticky on the outside as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to change my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to update it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give this a squeeze and put it
under the cameraman's nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what a cruel, cruel world this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's watching us all smell this bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cameraman really loves smelling it
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a real nice deep cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also once again these eight little
solid nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the bar you guys are setting so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep this as high as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a great thing for them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they want to up their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to produce a nicer product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just works out for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, the end user,
the patient, the person who's buying this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it important that they're the most
happy?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cannabis that if you were to
purchase and go home you certainly would
[SPEAKER_02]: not be disappointed later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can get sold herb where
you're like...
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nothing but a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one joint wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One joint and the rest of the bag is no
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well we'll make sure that we show Darren
smoking some of this herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll take some vapor hits through
one of the vaporizers that we have access
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll give you guys a little bit of a
background on the quality of the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm obviously only giving you my opinion
on the smell, the feel and the look of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's generally a pretty solid
giveaway if you can nail all three of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for showing us all these flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Dee is going to want to start
ordering some up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll order some up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write the feedback down on every
strand that I smoke and give a group
[SPEAKER_00]: report on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I wanted three of each one
but I'll take just two grams of each one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the MK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two grams of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two grams of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two grams of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, two, two, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two toes, two bond reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting nice containers like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'll say about this place as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say a second thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of you at home have noticed but
for bud that they're showing to people,
[SPEAKER_02]: this looks like bud that has never ever
been touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally looks like, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks, listen, I've seen a lot of bud
that's never been touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that looks like bud that's never been
touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's another great standard to up
because it's like, guess what,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is someone's medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you be touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we've squeezed a few buds,
I know we did that and I feel terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should buy those particular buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this, I will not give a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like touching it and giving it a
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, the dense buds,
I had no problem doing that with the MK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't change, it didn't alter it at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this, this looks like it's never been
touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the resin content on that calyx
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get that up close.
[SPEAKER_02]: The calyx right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a healthy, happy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a question that the viewers at
home might want to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can people who are watching this that
are like, oh my gosh, do you need to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian or do you need to be from BC or
what do you have to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at Med Platinum we try to, one that we
definitely do, have everyone have a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely- Canadian?
[SPEAKER_02]: What if an American comes up with a
medical license?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they have Canadian license,
like a Canadian prescribed license by a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor or a practitioner or a specialist,
then we can definitely go five years to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which isn't impossible to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're hearing this, you U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: people down in America that you are also
able to come up here as long as you were
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the doctor to prescribe it while
you're here, which shouldn't be that
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult because he can prescribe you any
other number of drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would then be able to have access to
come here and access Med Platinum.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's prescribed in Canada,
we can definitely- Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do mail order in Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do indeed, yeah, for federal MMAR,
which is Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then full prescriptions by a medical
doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also prescription from medical doctor,
MMAR licenses like the license that Darren
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have, the pink one from Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would they go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they just Google Med Pot now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we actually have a new launch of our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to MedPotMail.com and go onto
there, we have a full-size instructions
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can go through for registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have our phone number there and
our contact details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to give us a call, any emails,
concerns, comments, we're always happy to
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend a bit of time going through with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put all of that information,
your website and your phone number and the
[SPEAKER_02]: address in the comments of this video so
you guys don't have to go looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be right in the comments and
you'll be able to click on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there limits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it basically 150 grams?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're able to order?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to stick to the limits and
adhere to the guidelines as best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to or else it's an illegal
thing and that word gets the room to get
them shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it definitely is a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just try and do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm thinking right off the bat of my
friend, Del Betterich, who we met online,
[SPEAKER_02]: who we sent the pink apex to his wife for
her birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Del, this is another opportunity for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you don't have to drive to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at this stuff and I think that
you would be happy if you purchased
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine of this quality and acquired it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're telling me that they're going
to send it right to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right to your door.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something for Del and maybe many
other thousands of Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm going to be making an order
just because I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bud hasn't been touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to buy that bud, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right in the top bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: The calyx that we were showing on camera
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one bud, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll photograph that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what brand name is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that Colorado Fighting Buddha Fino
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be easy for us to remember because
it's number one, just like this dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: in the new Lyft Awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much to Lyft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to get a Lyft Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm gunning for one now that I saw you
guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a Lyft Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's resin producer, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I don't produce resin for
the market until it's federally allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we allow concentrates federally,
then I myself would step up to the bat and
[SPEAKER_02]: I would start producing resins with my
company FH Filtration Processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be looking for guys like
yourself who are specializing and learning
[SPEAKER_02]: how to really hammer it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be able to, when we do that,
know that you're doing it under patented
[SPEAKER_02]: license for the water extraction process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're under license.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it and we're paying for the
process that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well man, thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate you guys taking us
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful product and I don't know what to
say other than keep watching Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_02]: World and getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on brother.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got mine anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
